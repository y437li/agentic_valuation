In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate a good start to 2014. We reported revenue of $249 million, which was 5% higher year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including $130 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 1.28 million net new names, bringing our name base to a total of 128.5 million active .com and .net domain names. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continue to see benefits from our focus in and discipline in the execution of our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business. As part of managing our business, during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.4 million shares for $132 million. At the end of the first quarter, $868 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Before I get into the first quarter results, I want to provide updates on a few areas from the quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we intend to repatriate between $700 million and $800 million of cash, held by foreign subsidiaries, to the U.S. At that time, we had also indicated our expectation was that this would be done in either the second or third quarter of 2014. And I'm pleased to inform you that we now believe this repatriation will happen sooner and will be completed during the second quarter of 2014. During the first quarter, additional new generic top-level domains were delegated into the root zone. As you'll recall, VeriSign applied for 14 new generic top-level domains. 12 of these applications are internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. We applied for 2 IDN transliterations of .com in Chinese, both simplified and traditional Chinese, which are variants of each other. ICANN placed these 2 .com IDN applications in a string similarity contention set because they are variants, and subsequently, requested that we withdraw one of the applications until ICANN could address its policy on variance. For now, we have withdrawn our application for the transliteration of the .com IDN string in traditional Chinese. With the Chinese variant contention set behind us, we are now ready to engage in the negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 applications. Also, as an update, we do expect one of our back-end registry customers to launch their top-level domain during the second quarter. We will provide further updates as appropriate regarding the status of our applications and the status of back-end registry customers. On our innovation and patent programs, we do have progress updates. First, we talked about contracting for a pilot with a large firm for the use of an innovative new product service, which we have developed. The contracting for that pilot was completed earlier this year, and the pilot is underway. Second, there is an update on our patent program. We are beginning to receive inquiries from registry operators about using some elements of our patented registry technology. And as you may have seen, we joined with Juniper Networks in the quarter to provide multilevel optimized protection from diverse types of DDoS attacks. The new offering can provide highly scalable, always-on DDoS protection by moving mitigation from Juniper's on-premise DDoS Secure appliance to VeriSign's higher-capacity, cloud-based DDoS Protection Service. Further, VeriSign and Juniper plan to develop and promote open-source standards for communications between on-premise and cloud-based DDoS protection. No delivery dates or forecast for these activities are provided at this time, but will be announced as available. During the first quarter, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to begin a process to transition to the global stakeholder community its oversight of what is called the IANA functions and related root zone management functions, which, principally, include processing changes to the root zone like the addition to the root of new top-level domain names, as well as oversight of the IP address base. VeriSign makes changes to the root zone that are approved by NTIA, including adding new gTLDs, and then publishes the zone file as part of its Root Zone Maintainer role, which we have performed without compensation, spanning 3 decades. This function is independent from, and not related to, our contracts with ICANN to manage the .com and .net registries. As we stated in our March 17 news release, the announcement by NTIA does not affect VeriSign's operation of the .com and .net registries. The announcement does not impact VeriSign's .com or .net domain name business, nor impact its .com or .net revenue, or those agreements which have presumptive rights of renewal. I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 128.5 million, consisting of 113.2 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 4% year-over-year. In the first quarter, we added 1.28 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.6 million new gross registrations. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the renewal rate was 72.2% compared with 72.9% for the fourth quarter of 2012. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.6%. This rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2013. As we discussed last quarter, while there are many factors that drive zone growth, changes to certain domestic and international registrar marketing tactics have had a near-term moderating impact on the zone, as they are focused on increasing bundled product offerings rather than on driving domain name sales, and have been running fewer discount programs on new domains. While it's too early to say for how long or how much this factor may affect zone growth, we still see it impacting registration growth in the second quarter. By the way, since we discussed this during our February earnings call, we have seen some refocus by certain registers -- registrars back to customer acquisition and discount programs. Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, the overall renewal rate has been softer, primarily due to the lower renewal rates for first-time renewing names. Given our forecast for zone growth, including the factors just discussed, we expect .com and .net names added to the zone in the second quarter of 2014 to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names, and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. I'm sorry, wrong page there. Seem to be a little out of sync. There we go. Sorry. Last sentence was we expect common net names added to the zone in the second quarter of 2014 to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of $249 million, up 5% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $140 million, up 4.7% from $133 million in the first quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.1% compared to 56.4% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $94 million compared to $85 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 in the first quarter this year compared with $0.52 for the first quarter last year. As of March 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion, which included $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Liabilities totaled $3.1 billion at the quarter end. Of the $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, $192 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally. I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are : revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full-year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $249 million for the first quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $886 million, a $30 million increase from year-end 2013. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million compared with $106 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $96 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in the expense is primarily a result of timing differences related to implementation of certain planned marketing programs. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter expanded to 60.1% compared to 59.6% in the same quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $95 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.64 compared to $0.58 in the first quarter of 2013 and $0.65 last quarter. With respect to taxes, we continue to use a non-GAAP tax rate of 28% for our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share calculations. In 2014, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $50 million, which primarily relate to international taxes, including withholding tax on our intended repatriation. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 149 million shares in the first quarter compared to 150 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.3 million shares, based on the average share price during the first quarter, compared with 7.9 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2.4 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. Operating cash flow was $142 million for the first quarter compared to $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $150 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was $130 million. With respect to our 2014, our full-year guidance includes updates to our revenue and capital expenditure projections. Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.015 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 5%. This is a change from the $1 billion to $1.02 billion, or growth rate of 4% to 6%, as given on our last earnings call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full-year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 58% and 60%, as we expect sales and marketing spend to accelerate in future quarters. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $73 million and $77 million for 2014. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $50 million and $70 million, changed from the $60 million to $80 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the first quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with the first quarter of 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet, and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. During the first quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business. We have protected our business by providing over 16 years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS, and this month celebrated the company's 19th year. This track record is due to the strength and experience of our people, our commitment to excellence, and our specialized and purpose-built infrastructure. Our innovation efforts support our goals to drive profitable growth through the development of new products and services. And finally, we've been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our improved operating margins and delivery of value to shareholders through share repurchases during the first quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and provide value to our customers, employees and shareholders. We will now take your questions, and operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Jim, in your prepared remarks, you touched upon the NTIA and the transfer of the IANA contract, we still -- we heard your prepared remarks, but we still get a number of questions, people wondering, the next time that .com comes up for renewal, for example, is there any additional risk that this change would actually add in terms of any possibility that you would lose the contract? D. James Bidzos : Thanks for that question, Sterling. Yes, we get some questions, too. I think there's confusion because of just similar technology, but the best way I can describe it is to simply say these are entirely separate, they're entirely unrelated, and whatever plays out in NTIA's intent to exit IANA and transition this to ICANN is an entirely separate process. I know that there are some politics that swirl around it as well. But the bottom line is that the .com and .net contracts are entirely separate. They're separate agreements, they stand alone and nothing is has changed since those contracts were signed, meaning that the only we would lose those contracts is if we breach those contracts and fail to cure it. All of this activity swirling around IANA has no impact whatsoever on it. And I guess, I'm not sure how to be more clear than that, but that's the best description I can give you. So in a word, if your question is, how can all this IANA stuff impact our common net renewals, the answer is naught. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : And I think part of where people are coming from is, is this a sign that U.S., as a government, is relinquishing control? And if you had international stakeholders more in influenced positions with ICANN, could it somehow change what would happen to the contracting process the next time? D. James Bidzos : Well, the contract survived any assignment or termination. Our obligation survived, ICANN or its successors' obligations survived. So our obligation to perform and their obligation to renew if we perform all survived. So all of those politics, all of those potential changes. Also, if you watch the hearings, you saw the testimony of Larry Strickling from NTIA and Fadi Chehad\u00e9, ICANN's CEO, they both testified that there will not be a transition without appropriate safeguards. ICANN is not leaving the U.S. And so I think, those are just simply further indications that these -- that what NTIA said, that it is really transitioning what it believes is a clerical role, is the way that it sees this. So we have a long way to go while these safeguards are developed, but given that and given the standalone protected nature of all of the registry agreements, including common net, I just don't see a scenario where there's any impact on these contracts. They are completely separate. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay. And maybe one last follow-up question. Looking at the .net additions to the zone and the guidance for the June quarter, from your perspective, do you think that the new gTLD program is starting to have an impact on the growth of the .com/.net zone? D. James Bidzos : Well there are a lot of factors that affect the zone. They're all the things that we've been talking about for some time. Obviously, the changes that [indiscernible] for them is the changes in PPC, the law of large numbers as the zone grows and also, these behavioral changes in registrars that we've talked about. Now having said that, additionally, there are roughly 100 -- over 100 new gTLDs that are delegated into the zone, and they're accepting registrations right now, and have been pretty much for most of the first quarter, for roughly almost 3 months now. And in total, there are about 570,000 registrations in, collectively, all of the new gTLDs year-to-date. I think that information is current as of just a couple of days ago. So it's too soon to tell if any of those registrations or what part of those registrations are at the expense of a .com or a .net registration, because until we see the first renewal cycle on these new gTLDs, it's really going to be difficult to assess how much impact they might have on the .com/.net zone. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next call comes from Steve Ashley, W -- Robert W. Baird. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Just maybe to follow up on Sterling's comment here regarding -- and you -- Jim, you did a very nice job with just touching on all of the things that have been impacting the pace of domain name growth, with the behavioral change of the registrar, the algorithm changes, law of large numbers, is it your hope or would it be your expectation that at some point in future, we could see the growth rate of the zone reaccelerate and get stronger? Not asking for a timeframe, just conceptually, is it possible that we could see an acceleration in growth down the road at some point? D. James Bidzos : Well, I think what we can say and that we said last quarter, and I'll let George add some comments to this, but our models, which we have a fair amount of confidence in, were fairly good in giving us the basis for our first quarter guidance. They do show that second quarter is a little bit weaker, and they do show recovery in the third and fourth quarter. I did mention also that since February, we have seen a return to focus on new-unit acquisition and discount programs by some of the registrars. So I think it's early to tell if that's a trend. But I think, given all those -- and the fact that we did see 8.6 million gross adds during the quarter in .com and .net says that there's still very strong activity and strong registrations. So certainly, in terms of future zone growth, I'm very confident. George, did you want to add anything to that? George E. Kilguss: Yes. Steve, the only other commentary I would provide you is, if you recall our guidance that we gave on our last call, we talked about a zone growth of 2% to 4% in 2014. And that's still our expectation for 2013. As Jim mentioned, there are many factors that impact us inter-quarter, but in totality, we're really looking at a zone growth of between 2% and 4% for 2014. D. James Bidzos : Yes. I guess, put another way, we're essentially see -- we're certainly not changing our full-year 2014 guidance. Operator : And next is Fred Ziegel from Topeka Capital Markets. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : A question on the non-domain business, what's the status there? When are we doing? There's an awful lot of activity in DDoS, and I know you know that with Juniper, but what -- can you give us an update on kind of the products schedule in that part of the business, which I know is a small piece at the moment? D. James Bidzos : Yes, we don't break it out separately, as you know. I don't have any updates specific to any particular product schedule. Juniper did make a detailed press release, and you can look there for indications from their perspective on this particular partnership. And I did provide the 3 updates. We did get to the signing of a pilot agreement with a large firm that we're conducting a pilot with. I did mention some activity in patents. On the Juniper thing, I think one of the interesting aspects of that particular announcement is that it's quite different and interesting, in a sense that it's a hybrid solution, and it matches both our in-cloud DDoS mitigation service and Juniper's own on-premise equipment DDoS mitigation offering. And certainly, the DDoS market is growing. It's an area where companies are very concerned, and they're making investments. So I'd look at this as an indication that 2 companies that are major players in that market are getting together to try to provide a more optimized offering against more specialized attacks. So I think at this point, the only update that we can give you is that we've partnered with someone to address what we think is a growing market. Beyond that, unfortunately, we just can't say more at this point. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : Are you applying more resources, people, R&D to the non-domain part of the business, given the slowdown in net adds? D. James Bidzos : Well, I -- let me try to answer your question this way. When we put together our plans for 2014, we baked in investments in a number of growth initiatives. And those are fully funded, and we're executing and investing in those growth initiatives. And so all of our guidance contains all of that. We don't expect to change that. So to the extent we've planned for and budgeted for growth initiatives, we are absolutely spending that money where we're making those investments. We've made our bets, we've chosen our innovation programs, we've chosen our new products and services to pursue, and we're pursuing those. And so we're staffing and funding those programs. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And as a final -- I'm sorry, Walter Pritchard from Citibank. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just on the guidance, the operating margin guidance, 58% to 60%, you're running at the high end of the range right now. You've had a history of outperforming on the margin side, and you're also talking a bit about some spending in the second half. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of that margin guide. Why shouldn't we see you sort of hold this margin at 60% through the year? And then just had a follow-up question around some of the specific spending. George E. Kilguss: Yes. Sure, Walter. This is George Kilguss. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have some marketing expense that pushed into later quarters. Basically, as I've talked about, we put a little bit more rigor around evaluating some of our marketing programs. Today, we do quite a bit of marketing through registrars, and they actually give us joint marketing proposals, which we evaluate. And as we're looking at those to see if we think they're good for us driving profitable growth, we put some more rigor and analysis around those. And that has actually caused a little bit of a slip to just some of the approval of those programs. And so some of those have slipped into Q2 and subsequent quarters. I would say, approximately, about $4 million or so of spend -- we expected to spend in marketing have slipped out the first quarter. And I would say, a fair bit of that will go into the second quarter, but some have slipped to the previous quarters. So again, it's really a timing difference. We do continue to have desires to invest further in sales and marketing, and we're doing that, we're trying to do that in a measured way. And so as a result of that timing difference, we're still keeping the same guidance between 58% and 60% for the full year of non-GAAP operating margin. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got it, George. And then just following up on that a little bit. On the -- it sounds like you did have some registrars get a bit more aggressive on marketing spend -- or at least, on promotional activity marketing spend. I'm assuming that's more their own -- under their own choice or their own investment. I'm wondering, as you think about deploying more marketing dollars into the field and second -- especially in the second half of the year, is that what the driver is in terms of you believing that the zone file will stabilize and improve in terms of growth? And could you just remind us of the factors you think will drive that improvement? George E. Kilguss: Yes. So we made comments last quarter that we saw some registrars go for more ARPU-type of activity than they did for using domain name registrations to acquire customers. And we talked about domestic and international registrars both having that tactic. As Jim mentioned, we did see -- there's still some, particularly U.S. registrars, that are still keeping out with that ARPU strategy, but we have seen some of the international registrars regroup and go back to more of trying to acquire customers using domain names as their method to do it. So more of a customer acquisition. So we have seen a little bit of a change in that behavior. We also talked in the last call that in January, we saw a little softness from emerging markets in the month of January, particularly around China. Now post-January and post our fourth quarter call, we've actually seen a pickup in some of the emerging-market activity, particularly in China. We saw February and March be relatively strong in those markets. And so we're clearly looking for those markets to continue to perform there, but again, there's a number of confluence of factors that are going on that we mentioned there. But we still believe that our zone will grow between 2% and 4% in 2014. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : We noticed that a couple of your larger registrars are running $0.99-first-year .com promotions in the recent months, and just kind of wondering if that was able to stimulate some decent level of demand in the quarter and they may be a partial offset to some of the bundling and some of the going-after-ARPU dynamics that you guys had pointed out? George E. Kilguss: So Gregg, this is George. We definitely saw some of our registrars retarget domain names as a customer-acquisition vehicle. They were doing some discounting there. And I think they've seen some improved results from that. But not all registrars have adopted that. Some registrars have done variance of that where they may have to do something called retargeted or targeted price discounting, where maybe if you come back to their site multiple times, you might get a lower price, depending on your interest. But clearly, internationally, we have seen some registrars go back to discounting, and that has helped net registrations. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, George. And then just one follow-up, wondering if you happen to the number of names up for renewal in the Q2? George E. Kilguss: Sure, I can get that for you. So it's 27.5 million. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : I'm sorry, George, I didn't catch that. George E. Kilguss: 27.5 million. Operator : And we will take our last question from Priya Parasuraman from Wells Fargo. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : This is actually Priya for Gray. I was wondering if you have any more color on the Chinese IDN transliteration, which you talked about in your prepared remarks. D. James Bidzos : Okay, I'm sorry, I had trouble hearing. The very last part of your question was about the Chinese IDN? Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Yes. I was wondering if you could provide any more color on that, and if that could be reinstated or is that temporary? D. James Bidzos : Yes. So let me just describe what happened there. So basically, ICANN's policy was not prepared to address the situation where a single applicant had a variant. We had communications with ICANN going back over a year. Early on, they advised that we file separate applications until they sorted out their policy. They have not sorted out that policy as of this time. And so the simple way to move forward was to withdraw one and move forward with the other, which we've done. However, when they do sort out that policy, we expect that new policy to mirror their ccTLD policy, which does allow for these multiple variants. And so yes, hopefully, we will have the opportunity to reinstate and bring in the other Chinese IDN. But this, at least, allows us a way forward with the traditional Chinese IDN and it also allows us to move forward with contracting for the other 12. So for a total of 13 IDNs, transliterations of .com and .net, we are now engaging in the contracting process with ICANN. And I have Pat here as well, who's a little closer to all this. If you wanted to add anything, Pat? Patrick S. Kane: The only thing that I would add, Jim, is that when we chose between the Traditional and the Simplified Chinese variant, we chose to retain the Simplified and withdraw the Traditional because the Simplified Chinese is the bigger marketplace. D. James Bidzos : Yes. I hope that answers your question. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. During the second quarter, Jim and George will be presenting at the JPMorgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom conference at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday, May 21, in Boston. The webcast registration details for this conference will be available on the Investor Relations section of the VeriSign website. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation and continued support. This concludes our call. Thank you, and good evening. Operator : And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $250 million, which was 4.6% higher year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including $129 million in free cash flow. The base of .com and .net active registered domain names ended the quarter at 128.9 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. As part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 6 million shares for $300 million. On July 23, 2014, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $491 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. First, I'm pleased to inform you that during the second quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $741 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. Also today, we announced an increase in the annual fee for a .net domain registration per our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2015, the annual fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $6.18 to $6.79. As of the end of Q2, there were 15.2 million .net registered names. During the second quarter, additional new generic top-level domains were delegated into the root zone. As you recall, VeriSign began to engage in the negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 applications last quarter. We continue to move forward on our negotiations with ICANN but have no further updates at this time. Also, one of our back-end registry customers, new gTLD has gone into sunrise period, and additional customers have either passed pre-delegation testing or are scheduled for pre-delegation testing shortly. We will provide further updates as appropriate regarding the status of our applications and the status of back-end registry customers. Regarding our patent program, we continue to receive inquiries from registry operators about using some elements of our patented registry technology. We're also exploring new ways of bringing the industry together to coordinate ongoing development of registry operations. I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 128.9 million, consisting of 113.7 million for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.7% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we added 0.42 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.5 million new gross registrations. In the first quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72.6% compared with 73.2% for the first quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2014 will be approximately 71.7%. This rate compares to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2013. As we discussed the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive zone growth. These include search algorithm changes, changes to certain domestic and international registrar marketing tactics and confusion from the initial rapid introduction of a large number of new top-level domains. Also, we have discussed in previous calls renewal rates, for the first time, renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search algorithm changes, growth in geographies of lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions and other factors. Last quarter, we did guide to lower net adds for Q2 and indicated an expected recovery in Q3 and Q4. This recovery appears to be on track, and we forecast third quarter 2014 net additions to the zone to be between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $250 million, up 4.6% year-over-year; and delivered GAAP operating income of $143 million, up 8.4%, from $132 million in the second quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 57.2% compared to 55.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $100 million compared to $87 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.71 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.55 for the second quarter last year. On June 30, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, which included $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Liabilities totaled $3 billion at the end of the quarter. Of the $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, $729 million was domestic, with the remainder held internationally. I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide some additional commentary on our cash tax rate, and then discuss our 2014 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $250 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013. Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $9 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $98 million compared with $99 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $98 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter expanded to 60.9% compared to 58.9% in the same quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $96 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.68 compared to $0.58 in the second quarter of 2013 and $0.64 last quarter. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 141 million shares in the second quarter compared to 149 million shares in the first quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 11.3 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter compared with 9.4 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 6 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. Operating cash flow was $121 million for the second quarter compared to $142 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the second quarter last year. Second quarter operating cash flow was lower, primarily due to $28 million in foreign withholding tax on the repatriation completed during the second quarter. Second quarter free cash flow was $129 million. With respect to taxes, we continue to use a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. However, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. One of the primary reasons for this lower expected cash tax rate relates to our convertible debentures. The interest expense deduction for the income tax purposes is based on the adjusted issue price of these debentures, and the adjusted issue price grows over time due to the difference between the 8.5% interest reduction on the adjusted issue price and the cash coupon rate of 3.25% on the principal amount of the debenture compounded annually. The total deduction, which includes the cash coupon amount, has grown since the debentures were issued in 2007 to a deduction of $137 million in 2012, $146 million in 2013 and $77 million through the first 2 quarters of 2014. These amounts are exclusive of any contingent interest payments, which are also tax-deductible. We have added additional detail to our second quarter 10-Q to help you better understand the specifics of the tax benefits the company receives from these debentures. Additionally, our cash tax rate will benefit over the next several years from the usage of various tax attributes, including $192 million of foreign tax credits. In 2014, we now expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million, which primarily relate to international taxes, including the $28 million in foreign tax withholding on the repatriation completed during the second quarter, just mentioned. As a note, we have updated our non-GAAP definition to remove items that no longer appear in our financial statements, as well as to reflect the potential that we may pay contingent interest on our convertible debt debentures in the future. Beginning August 2000 -- beginning August 15, 2014, upside contingent interest payments under our convertible debentures may start to accrue if the upside trigger is met. The upside trigger is met if the debenture's average trading price is at least 150% of the par value during the 10 trading days before each semiannual interest period. Recently, the debentures have been trading in a range of about 150% to 155% of par. If triggered, the contingent interest would be payable February 15, 2015, for this initial semiannual period. The upside trigger is tested semiannually for the following 6 months and if the upside trigger is reached for that period, we will issue a news release detailing the amount of the contingent interest that will accrue during the relevant period. The semiannual upside contingent interest payment for a given period can be approximated by applying the annual rate of 50 basis points to the aggregate market value of all outstanding debentures, and dividing by 2 for that semiannual period payment amount. Non-GAAP net income will be decreased by amounts accrued, if any, during the period for contingent interest payable resulting from upside or downside triggers related to the subordinated convertible debentures. Our non-GAAP definition can be found in today's earnings release and on a slide in the appendix of today's earnings presentation. With respect to 2014, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net and capital expenditure projections. Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1,003,000,000 to $1,012,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 4% to 5%. This is a change from the $1 billion to $1,015,000,000, as given on our last earnings call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 59% and 61%, changed from the 58% to 60% range we gave on our last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and other non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $76 million and $80 million for 2014, reflecting the possibility that we may begin to accrue for the upside contingent interest expense on our convertible debentures starting in August of this year. This expense is increased from the $73 million to $77 million range, as given during our last call. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $50 million and $60 million, changed from the $50 million to $70 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q2 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. During the second quarter, we further our work to protect, grow and manage the business. One week ago today, we marked 17 continuous years of 100% availability of .com. This track record is due to the skill of our people and our specialized infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and extending our service offerings and through the development of new products and services. Finally, we've been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases during the second quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value-creation for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Sterling Auty at JP Morgan. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : One question and one follow-up. First, on the question side. We saw some news out of Google recently in terms of it looks like they're getting into the registrar business. I'm wondering if you could comment in terms of how you think that might impact the industry and maybe how it might impact your business. D. James Bidzos : Okay. Sterling, thanks. This is Jim. Yes, and maybe for some of those out there who aren't aware, Google did make an announcement recently that they would -- they are actually an accredited registrar, and they announced that they would be offering a package of services, including domain names to businesses. Their stated goal was to try to get the small businesses online at a faster rate. I think they said that roughly only half of very small businesses in America have Web presences today, and that's the market that they're targeting. So I won't speak for registrars and say what it might mean for them, but I think for registries like VeriSign, this is actually good news because Google is obviously a company with a lot of market reach and is able to target businesses. They did announce this as part of their release of news that .com and .net would be among the domains that they'll be offering to these new businesses that are coming online. They'll be offering some other services as well, e-mail and some other services. But I think for us, this is good news because Google as an additional retail outlet for our products can only benefit .com and .net, as they become available to more people from a company with tremendous capability to reach those small businesses that are not yet online. So I see this as a plus for us. Now Google also has a registry and they have applied for new top-level domains. Some of those have been delegated, but I believe they've said themselves that they keep a separation between their registry and their registrar operation. So I think -- I take their announcement at face value, that they're going to bring businesses online, they're going to offer a package of services and they're going to offer popular domain names, including .com and .net. So I'm encouraged by it. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : All right, great. And then as a follow-up, George, on the tax side, a lot of moving parts there. I just want to make sure, maybe you can kind of summarize the key, real key points as we think about it. And especially wondering, you talked about accruing for the contingent interest. Is that something that -- that contingent interest payment, will that actually still be in the non-GAAP numbers or will you pro forma that out? George E. Kilguss: Yes, thanks, Sterling. So with regard to taxes, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect our cash tax rate to be well below the 28% tax rate that we used to calculate our non-GAAP EPS and non-GAAP net income. My comments really are an attempt to try to give you additional insight into some of the key drivers of that cash tax rate, the largest of which is the interest tax deduction we get from our convertible debenture. As mentioned, the deduction totaled $146 million in 2013. Now that $146 million includes the roughly $40 million of interest, the coupon interest of 3.25%. But that full amount is deductible and helps shield our U.S. tax rate. Now I gave comparative figures in the script of the year-over-year amount, so it was $137 million in 2012 deduction versus $146 million in 2013. And for the 6 months, it was about $73 million in 2013, and that grew to about $77.5 million for 2014. So this deduction continues to grow between about 6% to 7% per year, and that's really a big driver of our deduction with regard to domestic income. I also mentioned that as a result of the repatriation that we did, we were able to free up about $191 million of foreign tax credits. These tax credits will expire in -- by 2024, but we fully expect to be able to use these foreign tax credits to help offset domestic income over that period. So we really have a decent amount of domestic tax shield. And when you combine those tax attributes with our foreign tax structure, I think you'd see that we're relatively efficient from a tax perspective over the next several years. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard at Citigroup. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is Ken Wong for Walter. Jim, just a quick question. On the new gTLDs, those are starting to trickle out into the market, and the .net trends have been looking a little soft lately. Can you perhaps help us understand what impacts you're seeing on your business from the new gTLDs? D. James Bidzos : Sure, I can expand on what I said in my prepared remarks. I talked about some impact from the confusion of the rapid delegation of new gTLDs. So I think the number as of today is over 300. I think it's over -- just over 340. So it's more than a trickle. There are very, very large number of new top-level domains that have been delegated. They've been -- the first ones appeared in very early February, and there are many of them that are available for sale. They currently have total gross registrations. They don't have any net numbers yet because they haven't been through a renewal cycle. But their total gross registrations for the roughly 6 months that new gTLDs have been for sale is just over 1.6 million, so I think that puts them right about on par with, say, .co. And just to give you some perspective, if you follow our daily adds, the data for the 23rd of July, yesterday, it's about 110,000 gross adds for common net, with about 30,000 -- over 30,000 net adds. And the data for the 22nd is almost identical, just over 110,000 gross adds that day, with over 30,000 net adds for that 1 day. So putting those in perspective, what I meant is that 342 new gTLDs over a period of 6 months is very, very rapid. And I think there is some confusion. And let me just say, first of all, we should be careful about drawing long-term conclusions until we've actually seen a renewal cycle, which we've not seen yet. But I think in the early wave, what you saw was lots of sales of premium domain names. And then in the second wave, I think you saw a lot of new TLDs offering non-premium pricing for everything. So premium pricing seemed to sort of diminish a bit. And then in the third wave, we've seen lots of top -- new top-level domains being offered essentially for free, in some cases being registered for customers in opt-out campaigns where essentially they're not even asking for them. So I think that's caused some confusion. The fact that there are plurals available. So for example, just recently, .supply and .supplies were both delegated. I think that confuses people a little bit. Should they get a registration in just one? Should they get a registration in both? Can they get a registration in both? What if the registration they're seeking is registered somewhere else with high traffic, like .com, but they can't get that? Are they going to lose a lot of traffic to it? I think these are things people are kind of trying to try a -- having some difficulty understanding. So that's what I mean by confusion. So I think that's had some -- that confusion has had some impact. I think it's mostly been in Q2. As I mentioned in my remarks, we did guide to a lower Q2, and we guided to a growing Q3. And I think the numbers I gave you for the last few days would give you an indication. For those of you that follow it, if you just simply take, for example, a straight-line method of the average daily net adds for common net for Q3, you get a number that's just under 1 million. We guided in the range of 0.6 million to 1.1 million. So I think that's generally what we see with the new gTLDs, some confusion in a very, very large number of them. We do know that a very large percentage of them, perhaps even a majority, are registered by speculators. There's a lot of speculator activity in them. So it's tough to say exactly what impact it will have on our business long term. I think the first renewal cycle will be very interesting. I think your observation about .net is an interesting question. I can't tell you exactly what the specific impact on .net is, but I would say that .net is probably more of a competitor in -- within the new gTLD community than .com, which is really sort of a well-known place where people register domain names for business. .net is as well, but I think it's probably sort of more seen in a category -- maybe even some people think of it as the new gTLD. But it does have 15.2 million registrations. It's growth has slowed a bit, but I can't tell you exactly what the various factors are for that. Maybe next quarter, we'll be able to tell you a little bit more. But that -- hopefully, that background was helpful. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : That was actually very useful. And then maybe a quick question for George. You guys bumped up the full year operating margin guide to 59% to 61%. Is there much kind of incremental marketing dollars that we might expect in the back half to pop up? Or does that get pushed out? I recall kind of in kind of Q1, there was some potential marketing that you guys thought you guys would do that might be pushed out. Has that been pushed out beyond 2014 and that's the impact on the guide? Or is that still expected to roll in this year? George E. Kilguss: Yes, thanks for the question. We actually saw marketing expense increase quarter-over-quarter. We talked about that in Q1 that we felt we would see an acceleration, and we did. Marketing expense was about $22 million in the quarter. And we continue to have a desire to spend marketing dollars. We expect to put more dollars toward marketing. Having said that, as you've seen in this quarter and previous quarters, we actively manage our expenses. We're clearly looking at the other line items, and we're actually looking at a balance to drive profitable growth. So we're finding areas, opportunity in other areas, to help fund the marketing dollars that we're putting forth. But you should expect us to continue to have a desire to spend on the marketing front. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Gray Powell at Wells Fargo. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I just had a couple. To follow up on the last one, can you give us a sense as to the key components that you spend sales and marketing dollars on? And then, how should we think social marketing -- or how should we think of the trending as you launch the new IDNs next year? George E. Kilguss: You broke up a little there, at least on our end here, Gray. But I think the first part of the question was regards to where we spend our marketing dollars, and we spend it in a variety of different areas. Traditionally, at least this year, a lot of our programs have been looking to spend dollars with registrars in various markets to drive awareness of the brand, whether that be domestically or internationally. But the majority of our marketing programs, at least this year, have been with registrars. And we continually evaluate all the programs that we have in play, assessing the return on investment in. I think some of the programs have worked very, very well for us. Some of the programs, I think, we can tweak and do better on or redirect those funds. But a lot of these programs that we do, we just don't spend it on a dime from quarter-to-quarter. There's a lead time for a lot of these programs that we have to set up, sometimes almost a year in advance with the registrars to get these things laid out. So we can slow down some programs if we see a program that's not working that well or we think that we may have missed the mark and redirect it, but it takes a little while to get that back in the market directed at another program. And as far as -- I think your question was with IDNs. We're still assessing IDNs right now. We'll go through a budgeting process later this year, and I'll probably have a better sense as to what that program would look like once we go through that process. D. James Bidzos : Just to add to that a bit, Gray, it's Jim. With respect to the second part of your question concerning IDNs, those IDNs that we've applied for when we get through contracting and get the delegation and actually make them available, by definition, are going to need to be marketed through registrars because they're going to be marketed in countries, of course, in the native language script. So we won't be working through domestic registrars here in the U.S., maybe their partners overseas. So clearly, we'll need to make some investment with the registrar together to prepare materials and develop marketing materials in the local native language script. One sort of interesting aspect of the IDNs that we've applied for is that they will not be subject to the same pricing restrictions that .com or.net, as a matter of fact, will be, because they'll be covered by the new Registry Agreement, and we will be allowed to price those with tremendous flexibility. The only restriction will be 6 months' notice on price changes. There won't be limits on what the price changes will be, and we'll be able to even price each of the 9 differently if we choose to. So we can price in factors that can address issues of particular marketing expenses, so we're developing those programs, but we are fortunate to have a tremendous amount of flexibility on how we market them and how we team with the registrars to work with them. So we're moving down that path. We're starting to work out those plans, but we're sort of focused on contracting with ICANN right now. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Got it. That's very helpful. And then just one more, if I may, and I hope this one isn't too specific. Do you have a sense as to the percentage of .com domains that are either parked or owned by speculators? And I know you guys used to disclose it in your quarterly domain stats report. And I think the last stat I saw in 2012, was it about maybe 17% and on the decline. I was just curious if you happen to know that statistic. D. James Bidzos : We don't have that number with any accuracy. I'm not sure that we -- I mean, we may have -- I'm not sure how we reported that number you're referring to. It would be speculative, anyway. I mean, I can -- it's a very difficult number to arrive at. So I'll give you one very brief example of why you have to be very careful about those numbers. I own a couple of domains, very few, just a handful. I'm not a domain speculator by any means, but I do own a couple of domains that are not active. I don't do anything with them. And I've registered 1 with 1 registrar, and I've registered 2 with a different registrar. Registrar A has a policy that allows them to park my domain because it's not active and to post ads to that. And so anybody who's out there crawling the Web, trying to assess what that domain name is would very quickly conclude, based on its characteristics, that the owner is a domain speculator. And I am absolutely not a domain speculator. The other registrar that I have domains registered through has a policy that does not allow that. And so maybe you'll get a more accurate accounting for that one. So it's very, very difficult there. Lots of individuals who have purchased domains, their family name, as in my case, or other domains, that they just aren't doing anything with at this moment. And depending on who they're registered through, they very much look like they're owned by domain speculators. So if you do see any statistics like that, I think you have to be very, very careful about them. It's a very tricky thing to assess. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back to Mr. David Atchley for any closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",

In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos : Thanks, David. Good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $255 million, which was 4.7% higher year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including $150 million in free cash flow. The base of .com and .net active registered domain names ended the quarter at 130 million. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 4.2 million shares for $226 million. At the end of the third quarter, $833 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Before I get into the third quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. As you recall, VeriSign began to engage in a negotiating and contracting process with ICANN on our remaining 13 new gTLD applications, which primarily consists of transliterations of .com and .net, earlier this year. We have been in discussions with ICANN during this contracting period and have requested certain modifications to the registry agreements that would govern these new top level domains. As we have not yet reached a final agreement, ICANN has granted an extension of time until December 30, 2014 to execute the new agreements for all but our .verisign application, where the deadline is July 29th, 2015. Also in regards to our back-end registry customers' new gTLD applications, 5 of our customers' new gTLDs are now delegated into the zone. As a reminder, most of our back-end registry customers have applications for .brand gTLDs. New gTLD applications that qualified as a .brand by ICANN have the opportunity to apply for an extension to execute their registry agreement for a period which ends July 29th, 2015, and many of our customers applied for this extension. Finally, Richard Goshorn, our General Counsel, Senior Vice President and Secretary, has tendered his resignation effective November 14, 2014, to pursue other opportunities. Thomas Indelicarto, currently an Associate General Counsel at VeriSign, will become Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary effective November 14, 2014. Tom joined VeriSign in 2006 and his lengthy experience with the company in senior legal roles will ensure a seamless transition. Over the past several years, we have successfully refocused the company through the completion of our divestiture plan, renewed key contracts, and created process efficiencies. Rick has been an integral leader in these, as well as many other strategic initiatives. Our shareholders have been well served by the company's restructuring over the last 7 years. We thank Rick for his important contributions to helping make VeriSign the company it is today and wish him the very best. I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the total base of active registered domain names in .com and .net was 130 million, consisting of 114.9 million for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.3% year-over-year. In the second quarter, we added 1.15 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations. In the second quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 71.8% compared with 72.7% for the second quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72%. This rate compares to 72.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2013. As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive zone growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity, and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies. Also as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions, as well as other factors. Last quarter, we indicated an expected improvement in Q3 and Q4 from the levels we experienced in Q2. This stabilization appears to be on track as we generated 1.15 million net registrations in Q3. As a result, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2014 net additions to the zone to be between 0.7 million and 1.2 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the zone are posted on our website at least once per day, allowing you to track how the zone is growing throughout the coming quarter. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss: Thanks, Jim and good afternoon everyone. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $255 million, up 4.7% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $139 million, up 5.1% from $133 million in the third quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 54.7%, compared to 54.5% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $95 million compared to $81 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.69 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.53 for the third quarter last year. As of September 30, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which, $599 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Liabilities totaled $3 billion at the end of the quarter. I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are : revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2014 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $255 million for the third quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S., and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at quarter end totaled $893 million, a $37 million increase from year end 2013. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared with $98 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter expanded to 60.6% compared to 58.8% in the same quarter of 2013. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $97 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.59 in the third quarter of 2013 and $0.68 last quarter. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 138 million shares in the third quarter compared to 141 million shares in the second quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 13.2 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter, compared with 10.5 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter repurchase activity and the weighted affect of the 4.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $168 million for the third quarter compared to $121 million in the second quarter of 2014 and $134 million in the third quarter last year. Third quarter free cash flow was $150 million. With respect to taxes, we continue to use a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS. However, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2014, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million, which primarily relate to international taxes including the $28 million in foreign withholding tax on the repatriation completed during the second quarter. As stated in our news release from August 18, 2014, the upside trigger on our convertible debentures has been met for the 6-month interest payment period from August 15, 2014, to February 14, 2015. As a result, contingent interest of approximately $5.2 million will be paid on the February 15, 2015 for the -- for this initial semiannual period. With respect to our 2014, our full year guidance includes updates to our revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and capital expenditure projections. Revenue for 2014 is now expected to be in the range of $1,006,000,000 to $1,011,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 4.5%. This is a change from the $1,003,000,000 to $1,012,000,000 given on our last earnings call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 60% and 61%, changed from the 59% to 61% range we gave during our last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $76 million and $80 million for 2014 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. This is a change from the $50 million to $60 million range given on our last call. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. In summary, the company demonstrated sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and net income as compared with Q3 2013. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business. We continue to protect the business by providing over 17 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com DNS. This track record is due to the skill of our people and our specialized infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. Also, we continue to invest in the development of new products and services. Finally, we've been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position, and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases during the third quarter. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Jim, the net domain name activity improved actually very nicely in Q3 after a challenging first half in terms of the 1.15 million net adds. And I know some of this is seasonality, at least relative to Q2 anyway. But is there anything else in particular that you would attribute the rebound to? D. James Bidzos : I'll let George comment on that. I'll just say that I think we did forecast last quarter. We were quite clear that we believe that our data and our modeling showed that we would see a stabilization in Q3 and Q4. So I think first of all, our modeling systems are serving us well, as what we projected actually did occur. I will just comment as well that Q3 was a record for Q3 gross adds. So the business is strong. I think it's calm as a trusted brand. And I think that, that's primarily at the heart of it, but I'll let George add some comments as well. George E. Kilguss: Yes sure, Gregg. As Jim mentioned, the net adds came in at 1.15 in the quarter, which was at the high end of our guidance. And gross registrations were really the reason that we got to the high end. 8.7 million was clearly up sequentially in both year-over-year. As Jim mentioned, it was the highest Q3 on record. And in gross registrations, we have really seen China continue to be a growth engine for us. China performed very, very well internationally. We also actually saw one of our large U.S. registers -- registrars -- also refocus on customer acquisition and began using discounts to acquire domain names for their customers. And so we also saw some benefit here domestically as well. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay terrific. And then looking within the TLDs, so .net is obviously much smaller than .com, but the .net names in the base did decline again, albeit very slightly this quarter. And I really wanted to get a sense of how you view this going forward. Do you think that we'll continue to see this go a bit lower? Or do you think that .net will resume growth at some point going forward? George E. Kilguss: Yes, so look, .net zone growth has been relatively flat all year. We believe, like other gTLDs, .net is experiencing some headwinds from the launch of the new gTLD program that happened earlier this year, about February. That program, that new gTLD program, has accumulated about 2.8 million registrations so far this year. But -- so we are seeing some headwinds from that. As far as long-term, we'll give some views at our next call, but I think it really depends on how the market digests those new gTLDs. There's a number of them coming out. There is quite a bit of confusion in the marketplace, and I think it's having some effects on the industry as a total -- as a whole. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, got it. And then just one last one, if I could, for Jim. Would love to hear an update on the patent portfolio and any potential new services. D. James Bidzos : Okay. We haven't provided any specific updates this quarter. We continue to invest and work on the development on a number of new initiatives and we are making progress on those. But no update on those and no specific news with respect to the patent program other than it's an active program. And, of course, we're very busy and active in filing patents for our innovative inventions here. Operator : And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is Ken Wong for Walter. On -- you mentioned some traction with your partners on gTLDs running their back-end registries. Can you give us a sense, now that you've got a few of those under your belt, how customers are going about kind of paying for that product line? Is it a fixed cost? Are you guys getting some piece of the transactional element? Help us understand how that revenue model starts to flow through. Patrick S. Kane: This is Pat Kane. Depending upon the type of TLD it is, it varies. And so if it's a brand customer, it certainly is a flat fee that we do because it's small numbers of registrations. But if it's going to be a more widely distributed customer, they tend to be more minimum payments and then per-domain fees on top of that. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got you. So far, these early days, it's more of the flat fee variety since it's mostly the brands, right? Patrick S. Kane: Well, we've only had 5 go in, so far, that are active. And since most of the ones that we have remaining are brands, we'll see most of those come online in 2015. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got you. And then Jim, you mentioned that you guys had reached out to ICANN to modify your contracts for the transliterations of .com/.net. Kind of what exactly are you trying to get changed? And then how does that potentially impact how you go to market with those particular domains? D. James Bidzos : Well, I don't think there's actually time to go into the very specifics. We are in what's -- this is essentially a contract negotiation, so we are in that negotiating phase with ICANN for our IDN applications. And just to -- in addition to what Pat said, I want to say that any brands, essentially, were allowed an extension -- to seek an extension to June 29th -- or was it July 29th? Unknown Executive : July. D. James Bidzos : July 29, 2015. That includes our .verisign brand and, of course, that would include the brands that we're providing the back-end services for. In the case of our own non-brand IDN applications, ICANN allows up to a 9-month extension, depending on your request and the circumstances. So without going into the details of our negotiation, we were given an extension beyond the September deadline until December 30th of this year. So we have basically a little over a couple of months to complete the negotiating phase that we're in with ICANN. I think I would say that this is a contract negotiation. This is what ICANN's Board envisioned when they authorized the form of agreement and the negotiating period, so we're engaged in the process. I just don't think I can, or it doesn't make sense, and I really can't go into all of those details. But the new date is December 30th of this year. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got you. Okay. So look for something potentially Q1 timeframe. And I guess last thing for George, I note the G&A expense kind of ticked up a bit in Q3 and overall, I think you guys take care [ph] of the margins. Just wondering if anything we should think about there. George E. Kilguss: In the G&A, nothing really jumps out to me, Ken. I mean, on a GAAP basis, we did see our stock-based compensation go up a little bit quarter-over-quarter and that's primarily because we have our annual director grants hit us in Q3. And we also use variable accounting for a portion of our performance stock units. And as the stock price is up a little over $6 in the quarter, our stock-based compensation increased a little bit as a result of that. But as far as core expenses, I mean, there were a few movements between the line items, but as I mentioned last quarter, I think you should expect that as we continue to actively manage the business. Operator : And from JPMorgan, we'll go next to Sterling Auty. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I wanted to revisit, you made the comment of headwinds that gTLDs have made on the .net base. Is there any concern that you'll see enough headwinds in .com that the .com could get to the point where it's flat or declining like .net is? D. James Bidzos : This is Jim. I think when George said that .net was seeing some headwinds from the confusion associated with new gTLDs, I think generally, .net may be more susceptible to that confusion that swirls around new gTLDs. We're talking about hundreds that have already been delegated into the zone and hundreds more coming. So I think there's some consumer and business confusion associated with all of those. There are many plurals and I think .net is maybe more susceptible to that aspect of the new gTLD program. As I mentioned earlier, .com is going to be celebrating its 30th year in 2015 next year. .com is and is also -- .com also enjoys the longest track record of uninterrupted DNS service, 100% uptime in excess of 17 years now. So I think .com is just a strong brand and strong -- and for that reason, it's a trusted brand. And strong, trusted brands always do well. So I think that's the slight differentiation I would point out between .com and .net, that I think .net is more likely to be -- to fall into that category of different or, in this case, new gTLDs, and possibly be more susceptible to issues surrounding the confusion, which I'm afraid may -- it's going to continue. I mean, we're seeing hundreds of more new gTLDs coming and they're coming at the rate of many every single week. So there -- that confusion is likely to get worse. George E. Kilguss: And Sterling, I would just like add, I mean, .net was 15.1 million names in the zone versus 15.2 million names. I mean, it's been relatively flat. And so I actually think .net has held up pretty well over the year with all these new names coming on, bringing new names confusion. So I don't view .net's performance as anything negative. I just think it hasn't maybe grown as much or it's been a little flattish just because of the comments Jim was talking about, about the name confusion. D. James Bidzos : Yes. Again, .com is a strong brand for the reason of trust, security and stability. I would just point out again that this was the largest net new add -- sorry, largest gross adds in Q3 on record. And this is -- now, we're almost a year into the launch of hundreds of new gTLDs. I think that just points out what the security and stability of .com and the trusted brand of .com represent. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got you, got you. And now, looking at the guidance that you gave for name additions for the fourth quarter, how much of that is expectation of continued good gross additions on the top versus improved renewal rates? And maybe a comment on how you see the quarter has started. I think it's probably a little bit slower than last year, but obviously, we're at a different point this year, I think, in terms of cycle. George E. Kilguss: Yes, Sterling. So I mean, we guided 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations for the quarter. You did mention that we're out to a little bit of a slow pace in the month of October, but what you have to keep in mind or what I would like to let you know is that there was a -- there's a national Chinese holiday called National Day, which happens the 1st week of October. So as China becomes a larger part of our domain name business, it tends to impact seasonally a little bit more in the months when these holidays occur. So that happened for 7 days in the first month of October and slowed additions a little bit during that time. So we'll see what the zone does. You and I will see it as it's printed on the website. But if you even took where we were today and annualized it, you'd come to the low end of guidance even with that holiday in there. So we feel pretty comfortable with the range that we've articulated there. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got you. Last -- [indiscernible] D. James Bidzos : Sorry, if I could just add something, this is Jim. I think another thing to consider with respect to the renewal rate, which you mentioned as well, is that at 72%, which I described in my opening remarks, the renewal rate has ranged between 70% and 74% for the last 5 years. And so we're dead center in the middle of that range. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : No. All right, that made sense. Last question is, maybe I didn't really hear a lot of color on the non-naming business, so the other areas. Any particular comments that you could give in terms of how it performed in the quarter? Any changes in outlook? D. James Bidzos : There's no update -- there's no news that we're actually delivering this quarter other than to say that we're -- if you're referring specifically to the NIA business, we're pleased with the development there, but of course, we're not calling that out separately. And we are aggressively pursuing a number of initiatives in which we are making progress, but there's just no update this quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel with Topeka Capital Markets. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division : As I understand it, ICANN for their fiscal '15 budget was originally using something in excess of 30 million new gTLDs. That number, apparently, is now 15 million and most people think that number is way too high. So does that all tie back to confusion, contracting? Are people deciding to just move back to .com? Or what dynamics are at work in that? Patrick S. Kane: Fred, this is Pat. What I would start off with, as far as the projections go, you're probably best off asking ICANN or better yet, maybe the registrars that actually sell the domains as to what they're thinking. But as Jim mentioned earlier, it's quite possible, and we believe, and we've -- and I've certainly seen written many times that there is additional confusion in the space, whether you have singles, plurals, who's going to buy what in terms of the different areas, what the communities look like, et cetera, and what still has to come out. So I think that there is some confusion. And I think, as Jim pointed out, with all these domains, the TLD that roll out every week, you'll see more and more confusion, I believe. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, I'll turn the call back to you, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results were in line with our objective of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. During 2014, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.010 billion in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $568 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 60.2%. Exceeding $1 billion marks a significant growth and an important milestone since the completion of our divestiture program in 2010, a year in which we reported $681 million in revenues. Operationally, 2014 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 34 million new domain name registrations and finished the year with 130.6 million names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 17 years of uninterrupted availability of the .com and .net domain name systems. As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 3.7 million shares for $209 million. During the full year 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares for $867 million. Effective January 30, 2015, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $453 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. Our balance sheet remains strong with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our strategic framework to protect, grow and manage the business continues to serve us well as we see operational and financial benefits from our focus and discipline. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As you recall, one way VeriSign participated in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of .com and .net, as well as .verisign and .comsec. We have signed the registry agreements for. comsec and 11 IDN TLDs, 8 of which are transliterations of .com and 3 are transliterations of .net. While these registry agreements with ICANN are signed before these domains become generally available, a few more steps remain, including delegation; controlled interruption, which deals with potential name collisions; completion of a Sunrise period; and finalization and approval of our launch plans. The failure to gain approval, if required, could delay a general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go-to-market strategy for the IDNs. I'll comment now on fourth quarter operating highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 130.6 million, consisting of 115.6 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 2.7% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, we added 0.59 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.2 million new gross registrations. In a few moments, George will discuss an update we intend to make to our definition of the domain name base, which will start with the first quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2014, the renewal rate was 72% compared with 72.7% for the third quarter of 2013. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 will be approximately 72.4%. This rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2013. As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic and eCommerce activity and changes in registrar go-to-market strategies. Also, as we have discussed in previous calls, renewal rates for first-time renewing names have been softer, impacting the overall renewal rate. This change is influenced by a number of factors, including search engine algorithm changes, growth in geographies with lower first-time renewal rates, previous year registrar promotions as well as other factors. Net name additions during the fourth quarter came in below our expectations, primarily due to fewer gross additions. Some of the gross additions strength we saw during the third quarter, which was coming from emerging markets, including China, did not continue the same -- at the same growth rate during the fourth quarter. Based on these factors and current trends, we are forecasting first quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1 million and 1.5 million names. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $256 million, up 4.2% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of $142 million, up 9% from $130 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.6% compared to 53% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $65 million compared to $292 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.94 in the fourth quarter of last year. Fourth quarter 2014 net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted earnings per share decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a change in estimates for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets in 2014. As described, last year, fourth quarter 2013 GAAP results included tax benefits, pretax nonoperating gains and expenses, which collectively increased net income by approximately $218 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.45. As of December 31, 2014, the company maintained total assets of $2.2 billion. These assets included $1.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $486 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3 billion at the quarter end, down from $3.1 billion a year ago. I'll now review some of our key fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $256 million for the fourth quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. 2014 full year revenue was $1.010 billion up 4.7% from full year 2013 revenues. Deferred revenue at year-end 2014 totaled $890 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2013. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million compared with $101 million in the third quarter of 2014 and $106 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 59.4% compared to 56.9% in the same quarter of 2013. Full year 2014 non-GAAP operating margin was 60.2%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $95 million, resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.70 compared to $0.65 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $0.70 last quarter. Full year 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.72, a 13% increase over 2013. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net for 2014 was a $77 million expense. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 135.9 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 138.1 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 14.7 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 13.7 million for the same quarter in 2013. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter repurchase activity and the weighted effect of 3.7 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was $170 million for the fourth quarter compared to $168 million for the third quarter of 2014 and $147 million for the fourth quarter last year. Full year 2014 operating cash flow was $601 million compared with $579 million for 2013. Fourth quarter free cash flow was $159 million, including a use of $9 million in capital expenditures. Free cash flow for 2014 was $568 million, including a net $6 million of excess tax benefits and a use of $39 million in capital expenditures. With respect to taxes, we used a tax rate of 28% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share during 2014. As we continue to optimize our tax structure, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share going forward is 26%. As a result, we expect to use a 26% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2015 non-GAAP results. Also, as we discussed last quarter, we expect our cash tax rate to say stay well below our tax rate use for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. As Jim mentioned, I want to note a change we'll be making to our domain name base definition and reporting starting next quarter. Currently, we report our domain name base to you both on our website and during earnings each quarter. The domain name base includes the active zone, which is defined as the names that resolve in the zone plus the names that are requested to be not configured for use in the top-level domain zone filed by the registrant. Historically, there has also been an immaterial portion of names that we manage and for which we are paid that are not included in our domain name base definition. These names get removed from the active zone primarily by registrars when they place the name on hold status. Over the last several years, the average amount of names in the on-hold status category has been approximately 400,000 names and the net change year-over-year has been very small. While still immaterial, during 2014, we saw an increase in the amount of names registrars have placed on hold status, which appears to be a result of these registrars complying with the new mandated compliance mechanisms in ICANN's 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement or RAA. In 2014, we saw an increase in domain names placed on hold status from roughly 394,000 names at the end of 2013 to about 870,000 at the end of 2014. While the number of these names in total is not material to our overall domain name base of over 130.6 million domain names, as registrars use of this mechanism has increased, we believe it now makes sense to include these names when we report the number of domain names in the domain name base. As we are paid for these on-hold names and they have always been included in our reported revenue and gross additions, starting with our first quarter 2015 report, we plan to amend our current definition of our domain name base to include these on-hold status names and we'll be consistent in our reporting of prior periods by also including these names for comparative purposes going forward. Before our next earnings call, we intend to update the daily reporting on our website to included these names. In the meantime, updates to the domain name base are still posted on our website per our current definition at least once per day allowing you to continue to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. The Q1 net addition guidance Jim gave earlier of 1 million to 1.5 million net name additions is not affected by this new domain name base definition as our quarterly guidance is focused on gross additions and deletions. With respect to full year 2015 guidance. Revenue for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $1.040 billion to $1.060 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is based on domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $84 million and $90 million for 2015 and includes the contingent interest expense accrual on our convertible debentures. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2014. We have grown non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong balance sheet and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos : Thanks, George. During the last year, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We continue to protect the business by providing more than 17 continuous years of 100% availability of the com and net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. Also, I want to highlight that this quarter marks the 30th anniversaries of both .com and .net. We're proud to be the registry operator of these 2 top-level domains, which are a key component of the Internet's infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. While we continue to actively invest in the development of new products and services where we continue to make progress, we don't have an update at this time. Finally, we have been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved tax position and by the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. During 2014, we repurchased 16.3 million shares, returning $867 million to shareholders, and repatriated $741 million of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just a couple if I may. George, you mentioned the hold status names in your prepared remarks. Can you give us a better sense as to what exactly that means and the impact on the zone files? I just want to make sure that I understand that correctly when doing my daily tracking. George E. Kilguss: Sure, I'd be happy to, Gray. As mentioned in our prepared remarks, names in an on-hold status have always been reported in our revenues and gross additions. So these are not new names. They just haven't been included in our domain name base definition. So as a result, they've not been included in the total 130.6 million name count. On-hold names are a simply management mechanism used primarily by registrars to place names into a hold status, which removes them from the active zone file and prevent them from resolving. The name, however, is still registered by the registrar regardless of the status. Now these names represent a very small and nonmaterial portion of the domain name base, approximately 400,000 at the start of 2014, and their totals have been relatively constant for many years. I'd also add, however, that registrars use this mechanism -- use of this mechanism has increased during 2014, and as a result, we feel it appropriate to amend our definition to include these names going forward. As mentioned at the end of 2014, the names classified with a hold designation totaled about 870,000, which was an increase of about 470,000 -- 475,000 in 2014, up from 394,000 at the end of 2013. Again, it's a very minor point, but we just want to provide the additional transparency and felt the definitional change would really help in this instance. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that makes sense, I think. And so I guess, like one day you'll include it in the zone files that we see in your website and it'll look like you added 870,000 names in one day or something like that, but the reality would just be it's a definitional change, is that correct? George E. Kilguss: Yes, just the base is going up. And as I mentioned, this doesn't affect our guidance as we're trying to guide to gross name additions and deletions. It's just a base that's going up. We get paid for these names, they're in our revenue and it's a small amount, but we felt the additional transparency made sense as registrars' use of these things had increased over the past 12 months. Gray Powell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. And last question, if I may. I know it's kind of tough to call out monthly trends in terms of domain name adds, but we noticed a fairly meaningful slowdown in December and then things really picked up significantly in January. I think you're tracking to, I think, it looks like 650,000 adds so far in the last 35 days. Can you just kind of give us a sense as to what happened there and what the main drivers are? George E. Kilguss: Yes, sure. So I think what you're seeing in the first month in bit -- a little bit in 2015 really relates to the Chinese New Year. Last year, the new year started, I believe, January 31. This year, it doesn't start till February 19, so it's about 20 years -- 20 days late. And we typically see the activity slow a little bit about a week before the Chinese New Year. So we've just had a good constant demand for domains in the month-to-date period, but we expect it to fall off a little bit as the Chinese New Year kicks in later this month. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : George, Q4 operating margins came in lower than industry is expecting and operating margins for the year effectively came in at the low end of your guidance. Was there anything relating to fourth quarter expenses that you would call out? George E. Kilguss: Yes. Sure, Gregg. So if you looked at our total non-GAAP operating expense, it actually was -- for the fourth quarter, actually it was down year-over-year, but it was up sequentially by about $3.4 million. And we saw that increase really come primarily in G&A. We saw that being up about $2.4 million and G&A was up in the quarter primarily because we had about $1 million of severance expense in the quarter. And then we have about another $1 million of, what I would call, seasonal fourth quarter expenses that hit us, some of which were related to higher consulting expenses as we approached the year-end. The other increase we had was in R&D, and as far as R&D goes, we saw a slight decrease in the amount of labor that we actually capitalized on the balance sheet. And as a result of that lower amount of capitalization, some of that flowed into the income statement and that was the majority of the increase in the R&D expense. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Jim, wanted to ask, just because we've seen sort of ongoing sluggishness with .net, if you had an updated perspective there. Do you see risk of a secular decline from new gTLDs? Or do think that .net will resume growth going forward? D. James Bidzos : Well, .net is a well-established brand, it's 30 years old. It did dip below 15 million registrations, but it's back over that. I would just point out that, in 2014, .net had 3.6 million gross registrations. And as of the end of December, at the end of the year, that's roughly the same as the total number of registrations in all of the new gTLDs combined. So it's a strong brand, it's been around for 30 years, it's going to be around for the next 30 years. I mentioned on the last call and I think it's still true that there is some confusion with the .net is suffering from, that this -- the 400-plus new gTLDs that are out and available today are sort of bringing some confusion. There are hundreds more that are coming, so I think that will probably continue. But net is a strong brand, 30 years old, well-respected, 3.6 million gross adds last year, 800,000 adds last quarter, so it's going to be around for a while and it will do well. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division : Okay, perfect. And if I could just ask one, one last one, also on this topic and I appreciate the update earlier on the transliteration front. But just kind of more, if you had any broader thoughts, on new gTLDs and specifically their overall impact to VeriSign's financials going forward, that would be helpful. D. James Bidzos : Well, I think a specific answer with respect to the financials, I think, is a bit difficult. But in general, I would like Pat to make some comments about new gTLDs. Pat? Patrick S. Kane: So the new gTLDs, I think the story is still out on the success of them. If you take a look at the 400 -- the 400-plus TLDs that are in existence today, at the end of 2014, there were 3.7 million registrations in those 400-plus TLDs. But one of the things in terms of identifying whether they'll be successful or not is really what the renewal rate is and we're just now going to see the beginning of a renewal cycle for this new gTLDs. And the second thing that we take a look at is what does the DNS traffic look like. And so if you think about the com, net DNS base today, we do about 82 billion transactions a day and we don't have any idea what those same transactions would look like for the new gTLDs, but that would be another indicator of success. So it's still -- time will still tell. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : You commented on some slowdown in the month of December in China then obviously you commented on, actually, China contributing to what was a strong start in January. When you kind of contemplated your guidance for domain names for this year and you kind of think about it, I guess, geographically, did anything sort of jump out to you as you kind of built this? Any sort of change that you've seen over the course of the year? Or as you contemplated 2015 or any kind of reversal of a trend that you may be did see, just any sort of color from a geographic perspective would be great on the guidance. George E. Kilguss: Yes, sure, Phil, this is George. So as we talked about Q4, we did continue to see growth in emerging markets, but it just wasn't as robust as we had seen exiting Q3 and so that trend waned a little bit. But they still grew. I think, in general, I think by definition, emerging markets they have their ups and downs, they do have some volatility there in their definition of being emerging. But we're still seeing a lot of growth there. More specifically, we still see good activity in China, we still see good activity in India and in Asia Pac. We're still seeing very strong and good demand for the products there and that's where most of the growth is going on internationally. So the U.S. market is a little bit more tepid in regard to that. Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up question on the capitalization of R&D. You said it was a little lower this quarter, so therefore expense is higher. When you contemplated your margin guidance for '15 here, what kind of assumption did you make of sort of capitalization versus the levels that you saw in '14? George E. Kilguss: We expect it to be similar to last year. But again, there are small movements. Fourth quarter I think was about 0.5 million, so it really depends on the projects that we're looking for, what stage those projects are in and if we actually have some products that are coming to market and we're actually developing new functionality, then we'll capitalize that further, the regulations in GAAP. But it really depends on the projects that we're working on, what stage those projects are in and we'll just treat it according to the GAAP regulations as to what get capitalized or not. Operator : We'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : This is Ken Wong for Walter. So Jim, in terms -- Q1 being seasonally strongest quarter on domain add, just wondering what you guys are hearing or seeing from your registrar partners in terms of their approach to domains, in .com, in particular? And then also have you guys planned to do anything kind of unique to try to drive activity here? D. James Bidzos : So first of all, with respect to what registrars may be doing differently. A couple of -- for the last couple of quarters at least, we talked about a shift in registrar marketing tactics where they were looking for increasing ARPU and then a shift back, which gave us some uplift over the last couple of quarters. So I think we continue to see that, which has helped us. As far as commenting on -- I'm sorry, not new gTLDs, but in terms of what we may do in promotion, we constantly run regular programs of promotion with the registrars. We use marketing programs to try to drive resources geographically and through other means. We did recently launch a contest for .com names and a number of other promotions that we're doing. We'll be doing a number of things through the year in recognition of the 30th anniversary of .com, in particular. But I think the best thing that we do is just simply highlight the brand and the widespread adoption of .com. I think if you watched the Super Bowl, for example, I think, pretty much everybody who advertised is branded .com. It's just a strong powerful brand and we do have the benefit of endorsements from every company that brands itself that way. George E. Kilguss: We also try to move dollars around or invest heavily or more heavy in those markets that we think are growing faster and we think we can gain a competitive advantage. And so we take a careful analysis at all the markets we look at and we make very strong decisions and base decisions as to which markets to go into, to drive growth based on our budget expectations. And so clearly, we're investing internationally in a lot of the growth markets that we talked about. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Got you. And then, George, on the margin guidance, so kind of 60% to 62%, some decent uptick there even in the face of kind of slowing revenue. Which line items would you say you guys are going to be able to extract the most incremental margin from? George E. Kilguss: So we don't give guidance, Ken, to each individual line item. When you take a look at our K, you'll see that our expectation is that they should be relatively consistent as a percent of revenue to what they are currently. But having said that, we're continuing to actively manage the business, and we always look for opportunities to continue to create efficiencies in the business. And as opportunities present themselves, we look to reinvest in the business as well. I don't think our strategic objectives have changed in the sense that we clearly have a desire to spend more in sales and marketing to drive top line growth and we clearly have a desire to invest in new products and technology that we think can drive positive returns for the company. And so we'll clearly look to invest in those areas and look for savings opportunities in other areas of the business to help fund those opportunities. D. James Bidzos : And if I could just add something, sorry, to the answer I gave you earlier to your question about com, in particular. I'm just reminded that, earlier today, there was a new record sale in the aftermarket of a .com domain, 360.com sold for just under $17 million. And I think if you've seen -- if you look at the history of some of these aftermarket sales of .com, we had dailymail.com sell for GBP 1 million last year. Z.com sold in a private sale without auction for $6.8 million a few months ago to a Japanese company. We had a porno.com [ph] sold for $8.888 million and 360.com was sold to, I believe, a Chinese company, like I said, for $17 million, that's a new record. It's an incredible statement about the value of the .com brand. I think Daily Mail is a good example because here you don't have -- it's not a single character. It wasn't -- it was purchased because the company had made such an investment in developing its brand in .com that it simply wanted -- sorry, in the U.K. domain that it owned that it wanted the .com equivalent and I think that just simply represents the value of a .com name. 360.com for $17 million, a record that, I think, just says a lot about the value of the brand. Kenneth Wong - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes, clearly, the brand still remains kind of the top-selling position for domains. I originally thought there's going to be [indiscernible] that bought it and I quickly [indiscernible]. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : On the transliteration and new gTLD for your guys, the timing of those 11 transliterations, you mentioned the phases that you have to go through. Can you maybe put some general time ranges? Would you anticipate that these would be in the market more generally in the first half of the year or is it second half of the year? Patrick S. Kane: So this is Pat, Sterling. I think it's really hard to tell because we are going to do -- we're going to ask for a modified Sunrise period and that will likely have to require approval from ICANN. We're not certain of that right now, but that's still going to take some time to get that and going as well as the Sunrise period and then the controlled interruption period for the identification of name collisions is also a long period. So it's hard to say right now as to what the exact time would be. George E. Kilguss: And Sterling, this is George. As we mentioned last quarter, many of our back-end registry customers qualify as .Brand gTLDs and ICANN gave .Brand applicants until July of this year to finish the agreement process. So I think your back half is much more likely than the front half of the year. Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, that makes sense. And could you give us a sense of when those launch in the marketplace, what kind of marketing spend or investment generally are you anticipating to drive those new IDNs into the marketplace? D. James Bidzos : I think that's tough to say, Sterling, this is Jim. The marketing plan that Pat alluded to that's a little different with different Sunrise period, during the Sunrise period, trademark holders are invited to come in and register their marked names prior to general availability. We have what you might call a much more brand-friendly sort of Sunrise in the sense that we are reserving the transliteration of the brands that are registered in .com. And so that implies that there'll be a different marketing approach. We'll simply be notifying existing registrants brands that the transliteration of their .com registration is available to them. So it's hard to say, it's not a traditional sort of a marketing effort. I think, in general, it means that we're not going to need to go out and promote the availability of these IDNs, although we'll certainly do some of that because people are free to register whatever they like in them. But the brand holders who are registered in .com have their brand name reserved for them in the IDNs. They're protected against somebody else registering a name who doesn't own that name. But it's an opportunity for them to have their brand name in the native language script of countries that they operate in. So I think you can see the obvious benefits of that. Putting a price tag on that marketing effort, I think, is - it's just kind of too early to say what it will be. But it'll be focused. It'll be more focused because it's quite targeted. It's unique, I think, as far as any TLD that's ever been launched. Operator : We'll take our final question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : In terms of -- you talked about putting -- registrars putting the names on hold. Why do registrars put names on hold? D. James Bidzos : Pat, you want to go ahead? Patrick S. Kane: So there are several reasons. One of the most common is that you will get a court order that would ask to put something on hold while it's in dispute. People will also have domains that they don't want to have in the general zone, so that they can have the name registered, but not able to resolve. It may be something detrimental to their corporate brand and they don't want it to be out there. And then the one that we've seen most recently is the 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement requires registrars to put on hold domain names that they cannot validate the who-is information. And so that's where we've seen the largest trend these days in terms of what the growth is in those particular hold names. Now once they do validate the who-is data, those names will come out of the hold status and then, of course, be active at that point in time. D. James Bidzos : Yes, let me just let me just add a couple of quick comments to that. If you're familiar with the so-called dark domains, these are the nonconfigured names where the registrant does not want it to resolve, for example, something that is not flattering about a corporate name. A corporation may defensively register that and they simply don't want it to resolve. We get paid for it, but it doesn't appear in the act -- it does not appear in the active zone. You can think of these hold names, we're going to treat them all together with these dark domains very similarly. So we'll get paid for them, but you'll see them reported in our domain name base, they'll be counted in there. The other thing is that George had mentioned this new 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement. This is the new agreement that the registrars signed with ICANN that they operate under. Now the number of accredited registrars is, I think, closer to 1,500 today where it was 900 some years ago. So I think -- I hope what we're seeing here, just to keep everything simple, is that all of them have pretty much signed this during 2014. And I think almost all of the registrars have signed it, a large number of them. So I think there's just this initial sort of compliance effort. Pat mentioned that they have to collect who-is data. This also means that some registrars that do not have direct distribution models, who actually sell indirectly through distributions, may find it a little more difficult or may find that it takes more time to collect accurate who-is data. And so these names will get put on hold while they go about doing that and then eventually they come off hold and then they're up here in the active zone. So that's sort of the activity that goes on. But if you understand how dark domains have worked and been counted, these are just like that. You can now think of these names on hold just like that. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And just real quickly, George, do you -- can you remind me, do you sell globally in U.S. dollars? George E. Kilguss: Yes, for com and net, the majority of our products we sell in U.S. dollars. So if you're referring to the FX impact in the traditional sense, we don't expect that to have an immediate or impact in our 2015 revenue. That being said, for some non-U.S. buyers of domain names, the strength of the U.S. dollar could create a perceived price increase, which could have an impact on demand. But while the strength of the U.S. dollar may be having some effect on demand, we really haven't seen that in any of our numbers, so it hasn't really been an impact for us to date. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes. And just to go back and you may have already given this in the past, but the renewal rates today lower than they were a year ago, 2 years ago. Is that true in every country? Or are some countries more pronounced than others? George E. Kilguss: Yes, renewal rates vary by country. Typically, in the more mature markets, the renewal rates are higher. In some of the emerging rates, the renewal rates tend to be a little bit lower. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Right. But my question is change. If we look at markets a year ago and today, which have seen the most change? George E. Kilguss: So we don't break it out by market. I mean, if you -- and if you want to talk about change, I mean, the first-time renewal rate at the end of 2013 was about 52.8% and the first-time renewal rate did come down to about 50.7% for the full year 2014. Previous-renewed rates were very consistent at about 82%. And so we did see some of the first-time renewal rates come down and I think more of that is a function of the growth we're seeing in China, which has typically lower first-time renewal rate than the U.S., which is our largest market now. Again, that's an emerging market. As those markets mature, I would expect those renewal rates to improve, but it's a large market that's growing and is still emerging. And so it's just becoming a larger portion of the base and so you get a weighted average effect on the first-time renewal rate. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. David Atchley for any final remarks or comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call.

In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter 2015 results mark a solid start to the year and were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of 258 million up 3.9% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance including 126 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the first quarter and had a 1.51 million net new names ending with 133 million dotcom and dotnet domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with 1.9 billion in cash, cash-equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.7 million shares for 160 million as of March 31st 2015 we have 917 million remaining in our share repurchase program which has no exploration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases.  I'll comment now on a few recent events. In March I was pleased to announce the appointment of Todd Strubbe as the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Todd joined us just this week and we are delighted to have him on the team. Also in March we completed the issuance of our 10 year $500 million senior unsecured notes with the five and quarter percent coupon. We're pleased with the results of this issuance which further enhances our capital structure.  Finally, as you may recall one way VeriSign has been participating in [Indiscernible] program was by applying for internationalized domain name transliterations of dotcom and dotnet. As mentioned during the last earnings call we have side 11 IBM TLP registry agreements and are seeking a modified sunrise period from [Indiscernible] since we spoke to you last quarter we have submitted our request for this modified sunrise period and our waiting response from [my kin]. The failure to gain approval could delay of general availability date or could result in VeriSign having to revise our go to market strategy for the IDMs.  I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March the domain base in dotcom and dotnet was 133 million consisting of 117.9 million names for dotcom and 15.1 million names for dotnet. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. In the first quarter we added 1.51 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations. In the fourth quarter of 2014 the renewal rate was 72.5% compared with 72.2% for the fourth quarter of 2013.  While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.5% this rate compares favorably to 72.6% achieved in the first quarter of 2014. As we discussed over the last few quarters there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include internet adoption, economic and ecommerce activity and registrar go to market strategies. Based on these and other factors we are forecasting second quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 0.3 million and 0.8 million names. 2015 will mark the third year in a row where the second quarter is expected to be the lowest quarter from a net additions perspective. Q2 has been our lowest quarter as deletions are historically at their seasonal high point in Q2. We believe this is seasonal gross additions are typically at their high point in Q1 and most registrars take advantage of our 45 days grace period after expiry to delete domain which fall into the second quarter. Similar to last year, we expect 7.5, 2015 net additions to increase relative to Q2's expected performance. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our Web site at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names as we discussed during the last earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we generated revenue of 258 million, up 3.9% year-over-year, and delivered GAAP operating income of 144 million, up 3% from 140 million in the first quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 55.8% compared to 56.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled 88 million compared to 94 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.64 for the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter, the Company continued to manage its capital structure through the issuance of its 500 million 10-year senior secured notes offering. The notes which are not callable mature in 2025 and bare a fixed interest rate of 5.25%. In addition, the Company also entered into a new five year 200 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in April 2020, which takes the place of our prior unsecured revolving credit facility. The Company had no borrowings under this facility at the end of the quarter. The first quarter ending balance sheet reflects the March 2015 issuance of the 500 million senior secured notes due 2025. As of March 31, 2015, the Company maintained total assets of 2.6 billion. These assets included 1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which 901 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were 3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from 3 billion at the end of 2014. I'll now review some of our key first quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $258 million for the first quarter, 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of first quarter totaled 925 million, a $35 million increase from year-end 2014. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes 10 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $104 million, the same as for the fourth quarter of 2014 and compared with $99 million in the same quarter a year ago, non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 59.7% compared to 60.1% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 compared using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.8 million shares. This compares to $0.64 in the first quarter of 2014 and $0.70 last quarter using 148.6 million and 135.9 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. Operating cash flow was 133 million for the first quarter compared to 170 million for the fourth quarter of 2014 and 142 million for the first quarter last year. First quarter free cash flow was 126 million, including 6 million of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and reduced by 13 million in capital expenditures. With respect to taxes, as we noted in our last earnings call starting with the first quarter of 2015, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Also as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used our non-GAAP calculations for at least for the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.043 billion to $1.057 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3% to 5%. This revenue range is changed from the 1.40 billion to 1.60 billion given on our last call. This revenue range still assumes a domain name based growth rate of between 2% and 3.5% for 2015. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%.  Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be in expense of between 104 million to 110 million changed from between 84 and 90 million for 2015 and reflects the interest expense as a new bond issue. Capital expenditures to the year are still expected to be between 40 million and 50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business an addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense.  In summary, the company continue to demonstrate solid financial performance in the first quarter. We have growing non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income we have maintain the strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model.  Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. During the first quarter we further our work to protect grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We continue to protect the business by providing more than 17 continues years of 100% availability of the dotcom and dotnet DNS. This previous record is due to the expertise of our people in our specialized infrastructure. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. We continue to actively invest in the development of new products, technology and services.  Finally we've been managing the business effectively as demonstrated by our improved operating margins, improved capital structure and through the return of cash to shareholders through share repurchases. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long term value creation for our shareholders.  We'll now take your questions. Operator we are ready for the first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Will take our first question from Steven Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steven Ashley : I guess first of all I was going to ask about the [position with icon] for the modified sunrise period has not got response back yet is there any anymore color you can provide has there been a dialogue are you are aware of the situation or is there any color you can provide around that? D. James Bidzos : The only update that we have at this point is that we've taken a step of filling the [RCEP] it's a common practice it's a normal method available to anybody who wants to modify registry service and so we've employed it. At this point I cannot make this evaluation and respond so we are waiting for that response but we just submitted it recently in this quarter. Steven Ashley : Perfect. And just lastly from me the renewal rate again the estimate for the first quarter looks to show some improvement and I wonder if there was some color around that? George Kilguss : Sure. Steve this is George Kilgus. So, as we mentioned our fourth quarter filed renewal rate came in at 72.5% versus the year ago period of 72.2% so slightly up in the fourth quarter and our preliminary first quarter renewal rate is expected to be 73.5% which is about 90 basis points from 72.6% in the year ago period we're seeing that improvement come from both first time renewing names as well as previously renewed names and we're pleased with that result.  As far as what that data point for future renewal rates I think it's a bit early to speculate there but we'll keep an eye on it and report that got to you next quarter when we have some additional information.  As far as renewal rates between international and domestic geographies, what I can tell you is that in the Q1 preliminary number we saw increases in both domestic and international first time renewing rates and then improvement in international rates for previously renewed names. Domestic previously renewed renewal rates were relatively flat in the first quarter, again the renewal rate is preliminary, we will give you the final rate in next call but we're pleased to see that renewal rate has increased in the quarter. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And will take our question from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Unverified Analyst : Hey, guys. This is [Indiscernible] for Walter. This first question for maybe Jim or Pat if you are there you guys hit the high end of your range on the zone file in Q1 and I guess the early trend in Q2 looks like a little bit more average [Indiscernible] counts about 50,000 net as it. Any activity in Q1 that you think you guys might have done to maybe go forward or is it really just the seasonal trend shifting away from Q2? D. James Bidzos : Well first of all Q1 was a strong quarter but I think that's just simply due to fundamental demand for the strong dotcom brand and the growth that we've alluded to in the past particularly in Asia. So I think basically strong underline drivers, strong demand for quality names, there could some other or less factors that affected but I think that's it predominately. There is some seasonality in Q2 that will drive this growth, but our models and our forecasts and our guidance of course are the only comments we'll make about Q2. George Kilguss : Ken, this is George Kilguss, I would agree that we're very similar to last year at this point in time, we\u2019re a little slow out of the gate. I think the website you're correct it's about 60,000 names and we're about 30,000 names light from last quarter, but as Jim mentioned in call because we have more gross adds in the first quarter in that 45 day grace period for deletions we tend to get more deletions in the second quarter and we tend to get actually more of them in April than any other month in the second quarter, so that's affecting I think the quarter-to-date or the month-to-date number that you\u2019ve seen today, but as we've mentioned we still believe that the growth rate for the domain name base this year will be between 2% and 3.5% and we believe will fall within our guidance that we gave 300,000 names for the second quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Got you and then George maybe on the OpEx lines, sales and marketing and G&A were both roughly flat sequentially. I think historically it trends down from Q4 just wondering if there was anything you need to call out in terms of how you guys are spending in Q1? George Kilguss : Yes, so you're absolutely right we were flat for OpEx sequentially, but year-over-year Q1 to Q1 we were up about $5 million. The year-over-year increases were primarily in marketing and G&A as you point out. In marketing, we have increased programmatic spend in Q1 of this year relative to the last year by about 2.5 million as we pushed out some of our marketing programs earlier in the year as compared to last year so that's really more of a timing issue.  On the G&A front, we were up about $3 million from the year ago period and the majority of that increase approximately 2 million was the result of a onetime non-income related tax accrual that we made in the quarter, but as we talked about again on the call or our prepared remarks we still expect full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin to be between 60% and 62% for the full year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay so that G&A we should I mean all things equal that should step down by 2 million in the June quarter? George Kilguss : We expect that it should come down slightly from Q1, yes. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Gregg Moskowitz : I just have follow-on to Steve's question; I know you still kind of parsing the data somewhat, but on the renewal rate because it really has been ticking up nicely and this quarter in particularly I saw a significant jump, I am just kind of wondering do you have any sense if this is the maturation of the customer base or is there something different in a way that some of the registrars are engaging with their customers? George Kilguss : So Gregg, this is George. I think it's a little too early to speculate on that. We do note the slight increase it has happened both as I mentioned in the first time renewing names as well as in the previous renewed names. So we're excited about that. We think that's a good trend, but we just need a few more quarters to see if this data point continued on our trend and we'll monitor it, and like I said, we report back out to you next quarter on that. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay and how many names I guess in the Q1 are base represent names that they were on and on hold status? George Kilguss : So they weren't much changed from Q4, Q4 as I mentioned was 870 and I think we're maybe 890 in Q1, but again the domain name base includes those names and so the 1.5 million net additions is an apples-to-apples comparison of the increase. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay right perfect and then just lastly, I guess question for Jim, so it does seem like new gTLDs are starting to gain a little bit more momentum just wanted to get your latest thoughts and opportunity that represents to VeriSign, talking about the backend gTLD obviously not the IDN? Thanks. D. James Bidzos : Well, I guess let me answer that in two parts. Gaining more momentum, we do have dot realtor and dot jobs as backend, .realtor is a good performing name but those names are available for the first year for free to all, all of credited realtors. So we're seeing some good growth there and we hope that will continue beyond the first year. New gTLDs are all about I think just over maybe 5.25 million in total at this point 14 or 15 months in the market. Comments were I just heard 8.7 million names gross adds this quarter and 1.5 million net for the quarter, so I think -- but I think your statement is fair and we certainly don\u2019t guide to specific growth and deployment and revenue production from our backend, registry customers are still many of them that enough and delegated yet. Many of them not launched their products yet. So I don't want to speculate about what that means for revenue, but I think it's a good trend. We think we do have nearly 200 about our 175 or so back end customers so we should know something in the coming quarter to and will certainly let you know. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And will take a question from [Indiscernible] Unverified Analyst : Hi, guys. Couple of questions one to George in an interest rate environment at 0% why are we paying almost 6% for financing and to Jim could you talk at all about what's going on outside the DNS business I've seen a few announcements on the DDoS partnerships that talk to that? George Kilguss : Sure. So, Fred this is George. Regarding your first question I mean when you look back historically for the companies that are rated DD plus like we are historically a rate and the rate could be a little attract 4.62% on our first bond and 5% in a quarter, today historically those are actually fairly attractive rates. Clearly we believe that we can put those funds to good use in the company to drive profitable growth as well as to drive shareholder returns so we're looking to do that. We like others think that we're on historical loads from an interest rate perspective and while we don't know when we do think that rates eventually will increase and we thought it was a timely opportunity to go into the market to raise some capital and we think that the rate that we're able to attract was a very fair rate and favorable rate for the company. D. James Bidzos : And Fred, this is Jim. If you didn\u2019t have a follow up to George I will go ahead and answer your second question. Unverified Analyst : Yes. D. James Bidzos : Okay, thanks. Yes with respect to DDoS obviously cyber security is a white hot space and a very large component of cyber security DDoS attacks are growing in size and intensity and frequency and for those on the call who are not familiar DDoS is a portion of our NIA component our security in it and so the were some of the recent announcements that we\u2019ve made relate to a strategy that we're employing where it started with Juniper last year but basically our strategy is to provide an open interface a standard essentially to allow those who are using on premise equipment to provide initial protection against DDoS attacks and mitigate them it\u2019s a way for those hardware vendors to basically right to expect that allows them to seamlessly transition to in a cloud mitigation using our DDoS protection service, we think that's really a great trend in the future it's great for customers, it's a great distribution model for us, it's more efficient it's part of our ongoing efforts to streamline and optimize our security services unit, so we help to see a lot more than that but thanks for noticing that, that's really about an effort on our pipe such as basically make DDoS protection more available in a way on demand where it's needed to the customers in a way that they want using our service available through the cloud. Unverified Analyst : Okay. Is it getting close to being a reportable number meaning 10% of your business? D. James Bidzos : We'll will let you know as soon as it is till than it\u2019s not this quarter but we'll let you know what it is we continue to see progress and worth we can continue to work on optimizing the strategy the team and more importantly the distribution model and the mechanism by which we deliver the technology, we think this was scale much better for us so stay tuned. Unverified Analyst : Can you talk about what other initiatives you\u2019ve got on the security side? D. James Bidzos : While we do have a couple of other components to the NIA unit one is a manage DNS which is very more of a performance component and we do have our iDefense unit which is a threat intelligence capability not only do we provide that service to a number of well-known large clients we are also a consumer of that service ourselves.  We're working on strategies to make those products more widely available and change the distribution model as well so yes we do it primarily a threat intelligence capability going to malware but certainly not limited to that and a lot of cyber security experts who work in that unit. Unverified Analyst : Would you be tying into other threat and intelligence networks from [Indiscernible] etcetera? D. James Bidzos : While we have a broad set of customers that include many companies well know security companies so we do think some of our malware identification service as to and other trade intelligence so yes we work very hard to broaden the market for those services but it's not limited to hand users it is in fact security companies and fire wall vendors of the type you are talking about. Operator : Thank you. Will take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys this is Jackson [Indiscernible] for sterling. Couple of questions from our side the first thing just to touch back on the IDN even with the sunrise period do you guys have the best guess as to when those will actually go up? D. James Bidzos : So, this is Pat. So there is a process that we have to go through start off with what's call pre-delegation which will happen in early May and there is a controlled interruption phase which last for 90 days, which actually have to deal with the main collisions and may concern that there is not any unwanted behaviors within the new gTLD space and don't get launched after that at the earliest, so it all really depends upon the getting approval from ICANN on the modified Sunrise period and see what we can do from there. Unidentified Analyst : Okay and remind, these you have a little bit flexibility with pricing if I am not mistaking, is that correct do you might just clarifying that for us? D. James Bidzos : Yes, there are no shared prices within new registry agreements for the IDN and gTLDs. And let me just be a bit more specific there too, we are free to set any initial price that we choose under the new registry agreement and the only requirement that should we choose to change those prices would be a six-month notice period. We have additional flexibility in that applied for 11 of these IDNs. Most of them are .com some of them are.net. All of them are spread across different countries in different local language character sets and we are free also to price differently in those geographies or differently for [congruent]. We have complete flexibility on how we price those products, so that does afford us a great deal of flexibility. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, that's helpful and then the last one from just a housekeeping one, how many names are up for renewal in March and in the June quarter? D. James Bidzos : So in the first quarter there were 29.5 million and next quarter there are 28.3 million names that are expiring. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. David Atchley at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. D. James Bidzos : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.",

The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. We reported revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $171 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.7 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.52 million net new names ending with 133.5 million dot-com and dot-net domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our track record of returning cash to shareholders continued during the second quarter as we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $156 million. As of June 30, 2015, we have $761 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Before I get into the second quarter results, I want to provide a few updates since our last earnings call. Today, we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a dot-net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 21, 2016, the annual wholesale fee for dot-net domain name registration will increase from $6.79 to $7.46. As of the end of Q2, there were approximately 15 million dot-net registered names. Also, as you recall, one way VeriSign has been participating in ICANN's new gTLD program was by applying for internationalized domain name versions of com and net. Based primarily on feedback from domain name community stakeholders, we have revised our IDN launch strategy. We will offer these new IDN top-level domains as standalone domain names, subject to normal introductory availability and rights protection mechanisms, available to all new gTLDs. This revised approach will not require ICANN approval and is designed to provide end users and businesses with the greatest flexibility and, for registrars, a simple and straightforward framework to serve the market. Finally, we believe this approach should provide the best opportunity for increased universal acceptance of IDNs. We expect to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs towards the end of this year, and we'll provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate. I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in com and net was 133.5 million, consisting of 118.5 million names for dot-com and 15 million names for dot-net. This represents an increase of 3.1% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. In the second quarter, we added 0.52 million net names to the domain name base after processing 8.7 million new gross registrations. In the first quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.4%, compared with 72.6% for the first quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2015 will be approximately 72.6%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2014. As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain name growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting third quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between point 0.6 million and 1.1 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on-hold status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. This website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call over George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we generated revenue of $263 million, up 4.9% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $149 million, up 4.1% from $143 million in the second quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 56.7%, compared to 57.2% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $93 million, compared to $100 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.71 for the second quarter last year. GAAP net income was lower year-over-year, primarily based on an increase in interest expense related to the new senior notes and contingent interest on the convertible debentures. As of June 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $844 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014. I'll now review some of our key second quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I'll then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $263 million for the second quarter. 61% of our revenue was derived from customers in the United States and 39% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the second quarter totaled $932 million, a $41 million increase from year-end 2014. Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million, down from $104 million in the first quarter of 2015 and compared with $98 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 61.3%, compared to 60.9% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $99 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.74 using a weighted average diluted share count of 133.3 million shares. This compares to $0.68 in the second quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter, using 141.1 million and 133.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Year-over-year non-GAAP earnings per share improved primarily due to a lower share count and the use of a 26% non-GAAP tax rate this year compared with last year's 28% non-GAAP tax rate. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $175 million and $171 million, respectively, compared with $121 million and $129 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in cash flow was primarily related to last year's second quarter international cash tax payment related to the offshore repatriation of cash. Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay well below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially, all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. With respect to our full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.055 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 3.5% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1.043 billion to $1.057 billion given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is also still expected to be between 60% and 62%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $104 million, and $110 million. Capital expenditures for the year are also still expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. Our guidance is based on expectations about the outlook of our business, in addition to our financial projections for interest income and expense. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the second quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. During the second quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value to our shareholders. We drive profitable growth by strengthening and marketing our current service offerings. We continue to actively invest in the development of new products, technologies, and services. Finally, we have been managing the business effectively, as demonstrated by our operating margins, efficient capital structure, and through the return of value to shareholders by share repurchases. We remain committed to offering the security and stability that are at the core of our business and make VeriSign a company with an unparalleled DNS service record and a company committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders. Just this past week, we marked 18 continuous years of 100% availability of the dot-com and dot-net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more and more important. We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back, Jim, to the revised strategy and maybe you can just help us understand what has changed? What is the revision and how is it different from the original plan you had? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Okay. Originally, we had a modified plan for a sunrise offering where we would reserve some names for certain pre-registered names in IDN.com. Based on feedback that we received from the community, it seems that it will work better for everyone and the preference on the part of our community, especially brand-holders is that we offer a standard form of sunrise. So that means that we will proceed with a standard TLD rollout for all of our IDNs, which does not require any ICANN approval. I think the important difference here in today's news versus what we talked about to you a quarter ago is that we no longer are waiting or require any ICANN approval, and we have some more certainty around the timing in rollout. We know what we need to do now. We have the set activities that precede an actual rollout. So we can say with some confidence that our staged rollout of our 11 IDNs will begin by the end of the year. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Under the previous plan, you had really hoped to provide, I think, more protection to brand-holders by extending the sunrise period and making sure that a named dot-com holder had the rights to \u2013 they would have \u2013 be the only ones who would have the rights to the new IDNs. Are you saying now that the third-parties after the sunrise period would be able to buy some of these IDNs? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Under some circumstances that might be possible. There are a number of different approaches that are available to all TLD registries under the new RA that we signed, the new registry agreement. And so, our marketing plan could include some of the capabilities that you talked about. What we aren't doing is specifying a plan that requires approval from ICANN that doesn't contain some of the precise sunrise provisions that were there before. It's a standard sunrise that will be rolled out. And I would like Pat to comment further on that part of the process. Patrick S. Kane - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, definitely we would contemplate changing is to not hold a reservation for grandfathered dot-com registrations during the sunrise. And that's the modification that we were trying to get approval from ICANN on. And we've taken that out, so we can move forward. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Okay. We'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering first on the IDNs, will all of your IDNs roll out simultaneously? Or will it be a phased rollout beginning at the end of the year? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: The rollout will be phased. We're not going to roll out all 11 at once. You shouldn't expect that we're going to sequentially space out 11 either. It'll be phased. It'll be based on a number of different considerations. Certainly, the size of each market, the complexity of each market, the opportunity as it exists will all be factors. But we can say that the rollout will begin before the end of the year. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Is there any update on pricing that you're willing to give us at this point? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Only that we're still working on it. And that, as you know, we do have complete flexibility by each individual IDN and by each region. So, we also have the flexibility to utilize premium pricing. There are a number of different \u2013 of course, it's very different from the provisions of the dot-com registry agreements. So, we have tremendous flexibility. So, we are working through that. But I don't expect that to slow down the rollout. And it is a bit early for us to describe to you what that pricing will be. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And last question, have you guys done any additional work so I get a sense of what the dot-com and dot-net pace looks like in each of the regions that you're going to rollout an IDN. So in other words, is there any sense of what we can expect in terms of uptake once they launch? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Okay. I'm not sure I understand your question exactly, Sterling. Are you saying that an analysis of existing... Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : If you look at where those IDNs are targeted in terms of the languages, so if you look at the countries of those languages. We talked a little bit about this last quarter. I didn't know if you went back and did any additional work to say : well, of the dot-com base you see this many names in that region and you'd take a reasonable percentage that might also want that IDN. Here's what the uptake might look like. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, first of all, we don't have precise visibility into that because, of course, we're working through registrars and not all the Whois data is available to us. So, it's not with great precision that we understand exactly what the distribution of com registrations is geographically. But of course, we do have some idea, and we are very aware of that. And that certainly factors into our plans. But I'm not sure if I answered your question. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, I think that's fine. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Okay. Operator : We'll go next to Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks, this is actually Priya Parasuraman in for Gray. Could you talk about renewal rates, particularly with respect to first time and previously renewed rates? And also across geographic market? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. So, this is George Kilguss. Your first question was on renewal rates. So our renewal rate for the second quarter was 72.6%, clearly up from 71.8% a year ago. We continue to see improvement in that renewal rate, primarily as a result of previously renewed names. We saw about a 70 basis points increase year-over-year, to about 82.6% of previous renewed rate. First time renewal rates are close to 50% still. And so, most of the improvement we've seen have been in previously renewed rates. As far as domestic, I think you were asking about different geographies. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Right. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: They haven't changed too much from previous reports. We do see first time renewal rates being a little lower in emerging markets, whether those be markets in Asia Pacific or India or Greater Asia markets than we do here domestically. But we continue to see strength in the previously renewed names. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks. Just one more, could you talk about your new DNS firewall product and how it's been received so far? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. It's a fairly new product so it's a bit early to give you any real detail on financial detail. But we can tell you that the reception is good in the market. There is tremendous interest in it. Most large enterprises and virtually all ISPs do operate their own recursive servers. And we operate a recursive service as well. The market feedback that we received was that a firewall would be a very, very welcome and important aspect of that to give these customers more precise control over filtering access using the DNS as essentially as another layer to prevent malware, which is of course something that's on everybody's mind these days. So I would certainly say that the initial response from the market is good. There's tremendous interest, particularly in the firewall aspect of this recursive service. And so, we're certainly hoping for success for the product. But it's early to really give you any more detail than that. But specifically to answer your question, the initial reception is a strong interest and very much so, specifically, in the firewall aspect. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : We go next to Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. There seems to be more volatility in net adds activity over the past six to nine months than anything we've seen probably over the past five plus years. And I know there's been recent promotional activity that's on and off, but that's always been the case in some fashion at least. And so, I'm just wondering if there's anything that you would kind of point to that might be driving some of the volatility in net adds from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Gregg, this is George. I mean, there are many, many factors that happen inter-quarter or inter-year with domain names. Clearly, we have varying growth rates in markets around the world. As I mentioned last quarter and it holds true for this quarter as well, we still see more growth internationally than we do domestic. Our Asia, in general, markets are growing much faster. But as far as the individual nuances for the net zone, some of those factors harken back to promotions that registrars may have run a year ago, and their respective renewal rates and effectiveness of those programs. Other issues may go to programs running this year that are driving net adds. And so, it's really a confluence of obviously adds and deletes. You're probably seeing more volatility only in the sense that the net adds in each quarter from several years ago are smaller than they used to be or they are currently. But we saw 500,000 net adds in the second quarter. As you can see our guidance, we're expecting just like last year the third quarter to continue to improve quarter-over-quarter. And we still see strong demand for our product globally. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, George. And just one follow-up if I could on dot-net names, so the attrition of dot-net did pick up a little bit in Q2. Obviously, you're going to be raising pricing by 10% in February of next year. And just wondering if there are kind of any concerns that you might have around price elasticity for dot.net? Thank you. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. I mean, we still believe that the dot.net product is a very fairly priced asset in the marketplace. We look at a lot of the competitors who are priced higher than we are. We think there's a lot of value in that brand. And yes dot.net's growth has been a little bit muted. But as we talked about, you have to keep in mind there's been over 700 new competitors entering the marketplace, a lot of those targeting \u2013 clearly, targeting both the com and net and the other legacy gTLDs. But clearly, net probably has been more affected than com has, even though I think they've been both targeted from competitors. But net has held up very well. We think the product is quite well priced in the marketplace, and fairly priced for the value of asset that we're delivering and the value of product. So, we expect net to continue to perform. Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel with Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : Thanks. Afternoon, everybody. I guess this might be for Pat. In your dot \u2013 or I'm sorry, in your dot brand customer base that you're working with, what's your sense of how they're thinking about it from the perspective of are they going to move from dot-com to .xyz or whatever? Or are they more thinking that this will be an incremental domain? Patrick S. Kane - VeriSign, Inc.: So, not all of our brand customers have determined exactly how they are going to use their top level domains. But we would imagine that some would complement their current dot-com with their own offering, but we don't see them abandoning their dot-com. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: And just to clarify, this is Jim, I'm not sure what you meant by your question, but there can be two answers to that. Number one is the way you put it, I assume you meant dot brand where customers may take their own. And I think Pat is right. So, for example, if we were to employ dot-verisign, we would never abandon verisign.com. We've, like most brands, we've invested heavily in promoting it and everybody is familiar with it. And it would simply \u2013 we would probably redirect traffic from one to the other. We'd never abandon it. And since we run the registry for \u2013 we would be running the registry for both dot-com and for dot-verisign, for us, it's the same reliable platform. But we do see \u2013 we are aware of some brands who \u2013 in fact, most of the dot brands that have applied, many of them are our backend registry customers. So they're not only keeping their dot-com, but they're also moving their dot brand onto our platform to make sure that it runs on the same reliable 18 years of 100% availability infrastructure that we operate. At this point, I think the traffic for anybody in dot-com is so valuable that I don't see anybody abandoning their dot-com for either a brand or another TLD. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : No. So the answer shortly, I guess, it's largely incremental as opposed to cannibalizing dot-com? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, I think if you just look at the numbers for dot-com and the net adds, you'll see that being the powerful brand that it is, it's still growing quite briskly. So I think those numbers speak for themselves. Dot-com is the reliable brand and people are choosing great names in it and the registration numbers are strong. It's in demand and people are registering dot-coms and, of course, needless to say, all of the global brands are on dot-com and I don't expect that to change. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for any additional or any closing remarks. David Atchley - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.",

James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $157 million in free cash flow. We processed 9.2 million new registrations during the third quarter and added 1.68 million net new names ending with 135.2 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Our commitment to returning value to shareholders continued during the third quarter as we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $156 million. As of September 30, 2015, we have $605 million remaining in our share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As discussed on our last call, we're making progress as we prepare to launch the internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net. Our launch preparations are proceeding according to plan as we prepare to begin a phased rollout of the IDNs toward the end of this year. We will provide more information on our launch plans when appropriate. I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 135.2 million, consisting of 120.1 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 3.4% year-over-year, as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. In the third quarter, we added 1.68 million net names to the domain name base after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. In the second quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 72.7% compared with 71.8% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2015 will be approximately 71.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2014. As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the third quarter, we saw strength in gross additions coming out of emerging and international markets, particularly in Asia. While we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we believe the pace of activity we saw during the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter. Also due to seasonal factors, the fourth quarter tends to have fewer net additions than the third quarter, as was seen in the last two years. Based on these and other factors, we are forecasting fourth quarter 2015 net additions to the domain name base to be between 1.1 million and 1.6 million names. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and reflect the definition change to include on hold status names, as we discussed during our February earnings call. Our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. During the third quarter, we generated revenue of $266 million, up 4.2% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $154 million, up 10.7% from $139 million in the third quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 58.1%, compared to 54.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $92 million, compared to $95 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 in the third quarter this year, compared to $0.69 for the third quarter last year. As of September 30, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.6 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $794 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.6 billion at the quarter end, up from $3 billion at the end of 2014. I'll now review some of our key third quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2015 full year guidance. As mentioned, revenue totaled $266 million for the third quarter. 60% of our revenue was derived from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the third quarter totaled $940 million, a $50 million increase from year-end 2014. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, down from $102 million in the second quarter of 2015 and compared with $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 62.7% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter of 2014. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $103 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 based on our weighted average diluted share count of 131.7 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the third quarter of 2014 and $0.74 last quarter based on $138.1 million and $133.3 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the third quarter were $155 million and $157 million respectively, compared with $168 million and $150 million respectively for the third quarter last year. Also as we've discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below our tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2015, we still expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $35 million to $45 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2015 are international. With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2015 is now expected to be in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.055 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 4% to 4.5%. This revenue range is narrowed from the $1.045 billion to $1.055 billion given on our last call. Non-GAAP gross margin is still expected to be at least 80%. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 61% and 62%. This has been narrowed from the 60% to 62% range given on our last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $104 million to $108 million, narrowed from the $104 million to $110 million expense range given on our last call. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $37 million and $42 million, changed from $40 million and $50 million range given our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance in the third quarter. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP net income. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. During the third quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. I'd like to expand a bit on what we think that actually means. I believe the best way to do that is to offer some long-term perspective on VeriSign's performance since the completion of our divestures five years or 20 quarters ago. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of non-core assets and to focus on profitability and value creation. Since then, revenue has grown sequentially for 20 straight quarters. Non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $0.31 in Q4 2010 to $0.78 in Q3 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and was $612 million over the trailing four quarters. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily from 44.3% in Q4 2010 to 62.7% in the most recent quarter. Over the last 20 quarters, we've returned $4.2 billion to our shareholders. We repurchased over 69 million shares for $3.22 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period, and in that same timeframe, we returned $982 million in special dividends, excluding payments to convert holders triggered by that special dividend. Our $2.75 per share dividend in 2011 was a 100% tax-free return of capital. We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top line and bottom line, along with the consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure are what matter most to our shareholders. We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework : protect, grow and manage is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result and simultaneously serve the interests of our shareholders, employees and customers. We intend to continue our steady focus on long-term consistency. We'll now take your questions and Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi, thanks very much. Would love to get some color on the acceleration that we saw in growth in domain names, 9.2 million new. That's a number \u2013 I don't know the last time we saw a number that high. And you mentioned Asia, but maybe you could give us a little bit more color on, maybe what might have drove that strength? George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure, Steve. This is George Kilguss. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did see 1.68 million net additions to the domain name base and as you pointed out, there were 9.2 million gross additions in the third quarter. During the third quarter, we saw continued strength in additions coming out of international markets, particularly Asia. Now that region includes markets such as China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, et cetera, and all those regions we've seen good growth in those regions. We also mentioned that while we believe these markets will continue to perform well, we also believe that the pace of activity we saw in the third quarter will slow sequentially in the fourth quarter. We did give guidance of 1.1 million to 1.6 million. The midpoint of that is about 1.35 million. If you recall, last year we did about 700,000 names in Q4 2014. So we do expect to have good net adds in the fourth quarter. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And so there was not promotional activity by registrars or anything out of the norm during the period in the Asian markets? George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: When you say out of the norm, I mean registrars do run promotional activities. I believe there is a few registrars that do some around certain holidays. But in most of our marketing programs, we put those in place throughout the year. So we continue to have a consistent level of spend or activity in those markets, but nothing unusual that I'm aware of from a marketing perspective. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sorry. I would just add to that that nothing extraordinary and I feel I'd be remiss if I didn't just underlie George's comments with the fact that com is just a strong brand and it typically performs well and we see it continue to do so. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And just my last question is on the renewal rates, you projecting them to maybe go down a little bit to 71.8% in the fourth quarter. What \u2013 can you give us some color on what might be causing that to go down a little bit? George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. So it's relatively flat year-over-year, Steve. We had 72% last year at this time, 71.8%, so we're talking about 20 basis points. But really the renewal rate is speaking to the registrations that were registered a year ago. We are seeing a little lower tick in the first-time renewal rate, but again that's more as we shift geographies and sell more into what we've talked about emerging markets, international markets, some of those markets have lower first-time renewal rates. But which have improved during the year, but at least quarter \u2013 year-over-year, we expect it to go \u2013 to be flat. But it \u2013 seasonally it tends to go down a little bit in the third quarter based on our historical activity. Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Moving on, we'll go next to Sterling Auty at JPMorgan. Unknown Speaker : Hi. It's actually Mina Confit (17:07) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have two questions and I just got disconnected. So if you answered them in the meantime, I apologize. The first one is about the new domain name registrations. You had 9.2 million this quarter, which I think is the strongest in the recent quarters. So could you maybe talk a little bit about what might have been the driver for that? And also I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what kind of contribution we should see from the IDNs, if you have any updates on that. Thank you. George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. So, as far as the strong adds in the quarter. Again, we saw good activity coming out of international markets, primarily Asia, but those markets I talked about earlier, China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam. We've seen growth in all those markets. So, we're very pleased with that growth over there. It seems to accelerate in the quarter. We're having a good month-to-date as well over there. So, we'll monitor that activity, but we've been \u2013 we guided up for the fourth quarter versus last year. We're guiding 1.1 million to 1.6 million, but good demand out of the Asia region is what we're seeing over there. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Great. And this is Jim. If I can just answer the second part of your question or your second question about IDNs. So, the news this quarter is that we are on track to begin a rollout and launch before the end of the year. I think it's early at this point to speculate about how they'll perform or provide any sort of guidance or revenue forecasts. I will say that I think when we're talking to you a quarter from now, obviously the beginning of the rollout with the first IDN or IDNs at that time will give us some things to talk to you about and I'm sure when we're talking about Q1, 2015, by then, we'll actually have been in market. We'll be beyond rollout, we'll be in market and we'll certainly have more data for you or more to talk about then. So, early now, to speculate about any of those things. I think the important news is that we're on track and we're still tracking on our commitment of last quarter to begin our rollout before the end of the calendar year in 2015. That answered your questions? Unknown Speaker : Yes. Okay. Thank you. David Atchley - VeriSign, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Fred Ziegel at Topeka Capital Markets. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : Hi guys. So just a follow-up to the last question. When you say begin the roll out, do I take that to mean some will be out by the end of the year but not all? And as a follow-on to that question, how should we think about it in \u2013 or how do you guys think about it in terms of prioritizing the timing IDN by IDN? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Fred. Yeah, so I think the first part of your question had an implicit assumption that is correct, that we are rolling them out in some sequence. I don't want to say that we're certainly not rolling them all out at the same time. And I don't want to say that we're going to roll them out one after the other individually and have 11 separate rollouts. There is going to be a phased rollout that's based on our preparations, market analysis, readiness, ICANN process, a lot of different factors that will go into that. What we do know for certain is that we will begin with the \u2013 with at least one IDN before the end of the year. So there is some ICANN process that does play out here. There is a \u2013 an early period where brand holders have the ability to come in. There may be some early access opportunities for those who wish to get into the store early, so to speak. But that process will have begun before the end of the year. I expect that certainly by the turn of the year and in Q1, we will be with at least one. I think that's the only thing I can say comfortably without speculating, in-market. So we will be selling and there should be activity and we should be learning and we'll have more to talk about when we do talk about Q1 certainly. More to talk about after Q4, but a lot more to talk about after Q1. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : Can you give us an update on what's going on with the .brand marketplace? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, I can give you a general high level update there. There were some delays associated with .brands in particular, as ICANN recognized that .brands had needs that were different beyond what ICANN had originally anticipated, different needs as opposed to those who are getting into the business of selling domain names. So, some contractual issues were worked on between the brand community and ICANN and additional time was given to the brands, I believe. I don't have a specific number for you, but a number of brands that engaged in that process, some did sign contracts by a deadline. I believe there was another extension for some additional work by some brands who had special conditions, but we haven't seen a lot of them out in the market yet, but some of them have certainly announced their intentions to roll out their brand TLD. So, they're not visible. It's not that active, but there was some, quite a bit of activity, mostly contract signing with brands. So I would expect that next year you'll see some .brands in the market. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : And is it still your sense that they're likely to opt for .brand as a complement to dot.com, as opposed to a replacement? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: I certainly think so. I think there are a lot of different ways to think about this, but there's just so much investment in the brand in the .com registration for most of these large brands. I think to use a metaphor that may not be exactly perfect, but I think will give you the idea. If you had a telephone number that you had invested heavily for years extensively in creating awareness for people to \u2013 call you and order your product and you \u2013 a different number became available and you opted for that. If it costs you $7.85 a year to continue to forward your old number to your new one, you'd do that for as long as you have any number of people calling it. But there are in some cases of these global brands, an extraordinarily large amount of traffic associated with their current domain. So, it's very easy for them to simply redirect that traffic to it. So this is, I think you're getting to a question that I've answered in the past, which is that I don't expect these people who get a .brand to abandon their .com. They're certainly not going to do that, it is their brand. It's inexpensive for them, and there is a heavy investment in branding and traffic. So, I expect it to be either an experiment or a complementary registration, and we'll see how it plays out in the years ahead. But, I certainly don't expect people to abandon their .coms. I just don't think that's going to happen. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : Okay, last question from me. Can you give us an update on your initiatives with security services, most notably DNS firewalls and DDoS? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, DDoS is one of the products that has been around for a while and is a main contributor to the product sales in our security services unit. The DNS firewall is new, still a bit early to really talk at any level of detail or sort of any generalized trends that we see. The reception is certainly good in the market, I'll say that. And, overall, the security services unit continues to grow, not at the point where we're reporting it separately, of course, but it is growing. And, we'll have more to say about that when it gets to a point where we can. Frederick D. Ziegel - Topeka Capital Markets : Okay, thanks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And, we'll go next to Priya Parasuraman with Wells Fargo Securities. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thank you, this is for Gray Powell. Just a question on the operating margins, which are strong this quarter. Any color on that? And, do you have any increases baked in for the new IDN launch expenses in your guidance? George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: So Priya, your first question was on the operating margin. Again, our operating expense for the quarter was $99 million. And if you look year-ago, that was about $101 million. So it's not \u2013 it's been around $100 million for a while. When I look sequentially of changes, there is really nothing that jumps out at me, per se, in our core. We had a little bit lower depreciation, maybe a little lower travel. In our sales and marketing, while it was down sequentially, if you look at the year-to-date nine-month period, it's relatively flat. There's really a timing of when we rolled expenses out. We rolled them out \u2013 those programs a little earlier this year than previous year. So you have some inter-quarter variances. But overall year-to-date from a sales and marketing, we're pretty much on track. R&D we're down a little bit. We've optimized some of our spend in our R&D area and we have a slight head count decrease. And then G&A, we had some legal expenses increase. But overall, if you read on our 10-Q, we expect those major categories to be consistent over the next quarter or so with what we've just rolled out there or just produced. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: And I would just add to that, with respect to the comments that I made earlier. There isn't a specific focus on the operating margin, per se, by itself. The operating margin is a fairly consistent trend line, if you draw it over the last five years or the 20 quarters, moving slowly and steadily in a positive direction. And it's \u2013 the real focus for us is that it allows us to move the important trend lines of top-line revenue and profit forward and pursue our long-term strategy. I think those are really the important issues. There are always gives and takes, as George said, but again, from a $102 million the year-ago quarter to $99 million this year, I think is roughly equivalent in our view and allows us to continue the trend lines that we're really focused on. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And then one more, if I may. Any thoughts on seasonality for domain name growth? Looking out towards 2016, I know it's early but I was curious if you think the international growth might skew the seasonality somewhat for 2016? George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, we'll give you guidance next quarter on our views on 2016, Priya. We can just tell you, if you look at this year, clearly Q1 was a strong quarter from a net adds perspective and Q3 clearly was \u2013 Q2 tends to be a little bit lower because of how the deletes come into the base with a lot of the strong adds in Q1 with a 45-day grace period. It tends to slightly increase deletes a little bit in the second quarter. And then the fourth quarter, December has a lot of holidays in the month and globally a lot of countries take holidays off. So, December tends to be a short month for us, and so we tend to see the fourth quarter seasonally be a little lower sequentially than third quarter. But we'll give you some more color on our views on 2016 next quarter. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Walter Pritchard at Citi. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: Hi. Thanks. George, I'm wondering if you can talk about from a sales and marketing perspective on those expenses were probably the area that your OpEx was the lightest versus what we were looking for and I see you did have good strength in names. Did you make a trade-off there in terms of sort of marketing programs that you peeled back during the quarter as you saw the strength? And generally how should we think about the level of sales and marketing, especially marketing spend as we go into Q4 and into early next year? George E. Kilguss - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Walter. So, there was no conscious effort to pull any programs. As I mentioned earlier to a caller, if you look at the nine-month year-to-date expense in sales and marketing, it's relatively flat. We did this year roll some expenses \u2013 I'm sorry, roll some programs out a little earlier in the year. So, a little bit frontloaded. If you look at it on a quarterly basis, we had slightly higher sales and marketing in Q1 and Q2. It's just kind of how it fell this year. We constantly evaluate our programs, but they seem to be performing well. As far as Q4, we expect the expense in sales and marketing to be consistent with what it was this quarter. Walter Pritchard - Citigroup: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We have no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any concluding remarks. Sir? David Atchley - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference and again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today.",

James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. During 2015, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.059 billion in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $629 million, and producing full-year non-GAAP operating margins of 61.5%. Operationally, 2015 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 38.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 139.8 million .com and .net names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 18 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. As a part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. During the full-year 2015, we repurchased 9.3 million shares for $622 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $611 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, of which $753 million was held domestically and the remainder held abroad. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 139.8 million, consisting of 124 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 6.3% year-over-year, as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. In the fourth quarter, we added 4.6 million net names to the domain name base after processing 12.2 million new gross registrations. In the third quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 71.9% compared with 72% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014. As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. Towards the end of the third quarter and mainly during the first two months of the fourth quarter, we saw higher volume of gross additions coming largely in our Asia-Pacific region, primarily through registrars in China. While we believe China and the Asia-Pacific region will continue to perform well, we expect these markets to return to more normal levels in 2016. Based on registrar feedback, the most likely contributor of the additional gross addition volume appears to have been driven primarily from domain investment activity in that region. Also, as we have noted in the past, the renewal rates for domain names registered in emerging markets, such as Asia-Pacific, have historically been lower than those registered in more developed markets. Considering these factors, we expect the first three quarters of the year to have roughly a similar pattern of quarterly net additions to the domain name base as we saw during 2015. However, we expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have the largest percentage of first-time renewing names that we've seen as a result of the strong Q4 2015 performance. While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to the unusually large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, deletions could exceed additions in the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the first quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 1.5 million and 2 million names. And we are forecasting the full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 0.5% and 2%. As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day. And our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter and year. Finally, as an update related to the launch of our internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net, during December, the localized Katakana version of .com in Japanese launched and will be in the Sunrise Period until March 14. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the full-year 2015, we recognize revenue of $1.059 billion, up 4.9% from full-year 2014 revenue and delivered GAAP operating income of $606 million, up 7.4% from $564 million for the full-year 2014. During the fourth quarter, we recognized revenue of $273 million, up 6.5% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $158 million, up 11.3% from $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter came to 58.1%, compared to 55.6% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $102 million, compared to $65 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter this year, compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter last year. As described last year, our fourth quarter 2014 GAAP net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to a reorganization of certain international operations and a charge in estimate for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets back in 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.4 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $753 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at year end, up from $2.8 billion at the end of 2014, primarily as a result of the issuance of a new 10-year, 5.25%, $500 million debenture completed in the first quarter of 2015. I'll now review some of our key metrics for our fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance. As mentioned, 2015 full year revenue was $1.059 billion, up 4.9% from full-year 2014 revenues. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015 totaled $273 million, up 6.5% from the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenues was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $961 million, a $71 million increase from year-end 2014. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million compared with $99 million in the third quarter of 2015 and down from $104 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 62.4% compared to 59.4% in the same quarter of 2014. Full-year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 61.5%. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $105 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.78 last quarter, based on 135.9 million and 131.7 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Full-year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.05, a 12% increase over 2014. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 131.7 million shares in the third quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.4 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 14.7 million for the same quarter in 2014 and 18 million shares last quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the fourth quarter were $189 million and $176 million, respectively, compared with $170 million and $159 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. Full-year 2015 operating cash flow was $651 million compared with $601 million for 2014. Free cash flow for 2015 was $629 million compared with $568 million for 2014. Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below the 26% tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. In 2016 we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $10 million to $20 million. Due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. Full year-2016 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income, net, is expected to be an expense of between $114 million to $120 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2015. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP net income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We have maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. I want to take this opportunity to update you on another item. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to transition its historic stewardship role related to the Internet's domain name system to the global multistakeholder community. A year later, in March of 2015, in preparation for the implementation phase of the IANA stewardship transition, NTIA asked VeriSign and ICANN to submit a proposal detailing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with root zone management. These related root zone management functions involve our role as Root Zone Maintainer under the Cooperative Agreement with the Department of Commerce. In response to the March 2015 request from NTIA, ICANN and VeriSign submitted a proposal to NTIA, describing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with the root zone management in a manner that maintains the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet's domain name system. NTIA published this joint ICANN-VeriSign proposal on August 17, 2015, noting it was anticipated that performance of the Root Zone Maintainer function would be conducted by VeriSign under a new Root Zone Maintainer Agreement with ICANN once the Root Zone Maintainer function obligations under the Cooperative Agreement were completed. ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of drafting the new Root Zone Maintainer Agreement to perform this Root Zone Maintainer role as a commercial service for ICANN upon the successful transition of the IANA functions. The Root Zone Maintainer functions performed by VeriSign are delivered via the secure, stable and resilient purpose-built DNS infrastructure that has delivered .com, .net and A and J RootZone services for an uninterrupted and unparalleled 18 years. To ensure that root operations continue to perform at the same high level during the expected 10-year term of the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement, ICANN and VeriSign are in discussions to extend the term of the .com Registry Agreement to coincide with the expected 10-year term of the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement, ensuring that the terms of the two agreements are the same, will promote the stability of root operations, and will remove potential instability that might otherwise arise if the terms did not coincide. VeriSign's commitment to security, stability, and resiliency within the DNS is the first priority and consideration in the performance of our roles as directed by ICANN and the NTIA. While we cannot yet determine when or if these documents will be completed, having stability with these key contracts is an important component of the stability of the core infrastructure of the Internet. While ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stage of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents, there are several important steps that still need to occur including completing the drafting of the agreements, posting them for public comment and obtaining approvals from ICANN's and VeriSign's Board of Directors. Additionally, under the Cooperative Agreement, we may not enter into the contemplated extension of the .com Registry Agreement without the prior written approval of the Department of Commerce. If the department does not approve the extension, then the current .com Registry Agreement will remain unchanged. We will provide periodic updates, as appropriate, on our progress toward these objectives. In closing, during the last year, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. The end of 2015 marks five years since the completion of our divestiture program and the sale of our Authentication Services Business. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of non-core assets and to focus on profitability and value creation. Since the end of 2010, revenue has grown sequentially for five straight years. Annual non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $1.04 in 2010 to $3.05 in 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and was $629 million during 2015. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily from 41.8% in 2010 to 61.5% during 2015. We have returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders, including repurchasing over 70 million shares for $3.36 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure, are what matter most to our shareholders. We believe the proper balance within our strategy framework, protect, grow and manage, is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result and simultaneously serve the interests of our shareholders, employees and customers. I am sometimes asked what the next big thing is for VeriSign. And my answer is simple, more of the same; steady and efficient operation of a great business, so that we can steadily and consistently create value and efficiently return that value to our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thanks so much; just like to go back to the changing the terms of the .com agreement. And just be clear, can you tell us what, from a practical standpoint, from an investor perspective, is going to change potentially with the new contracting? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure, Steve. So, first of all, I think it helps to just understand that we're not actually changing the terms of the .com Registry Agreement. And this is not a renewal. This is an extension. We are negotiating entering into a 10-year contract with ICANN to perform commercial services as the Root Zone Maintainer, services that we now perform under contract to the NTIA. The contemplated or anticipated term of that agreement is 10 years. In order to ensure the same steady, available, uninterrupted, secure and stable environment that we've been providing for three decades as a Root Zone Maintainer, it is also anticipated \u2013 we are discussing \u2013 the extension of the .com Registry Agreement for 10 years. So at that point, should all of these conditions that I described earlier, for example, approval of ICANN's Board of Directors and VeriSign's Board of Directors, no changes whatsoever can be made to the .com Registry Agreement without the consent of the NTIA. So subject to those approvals and the transition occurring, then we would have 10-year concurrent terms for the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement. So what you would see is essentially a change of the date, the term, of the .com Registry Agreement. That's essentially the change. From an investor viewpoint, instead of a renewal in 2018, you would see a 10-year term that starts with the effective date of the two changes, the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the extended .com Registry Agreement. So, instead of November 30, 2018, you would see a date that is 10 years from the effective date of those two. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): But when would that be executed? When is the date of actually extending the terms? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: So, again, qualifying all of this to say that if we conclude our negotiations, we get all the necessary approvals, the triggering event that marks the \"effective date\" would then be the IANA transition occurring. That process has been underway since March of 2014. I certainly can't say with any definite date when that will happen, but I can tell you that there is steady progress on the transition. The target date is September of 2016. That is the date of the expiration of the IANA contract between NTIA and ICANN. And if everything occurs at that point and it is certainly possible, all of the work that needs to be done can be accomplished by that date, but again I can't, of course, tell you what will happen when. I can simply tell you that that is everyone's goal and that the community, ICANN, NTIA, et cetera, are all driving for that September 2016 date. So, that is the best date that everybody's shooting for. So, if you wanted to know roughly when that might happen, that would be the target date. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Perfect. And then, just my quick follow-up here is on the surge in domain names we saw in China and you called out the fact that just getting some feedback from registrars, that it looked like it was investment. What do you think drove that investment? Is it possible that the new gTLDs, specifically the ones you own, the .coms, are an incentive for people to own, maybe .com in other languages? Well, what might have driven the investment surge? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, Steve, this is George. Just to put some more clarification around it, the growth in the fourth quarter was not unique to .com and .net. The local ccTLD .cn reported increased growth in the quarter. We've seen other TLDs report growth. And so, .com and .net has also performed quite well in that year. So it was \u2013 we call it \u2013 clearly solid investment community in the emerging market performed well. Again, we don't have direct visibility into the end user. Our customers are the registrars in those regions. But again, based on the information that we have, we saw that the investor community performed well across the board. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse. Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks, guys, just a couple questions and congrats on a strong quarter. First, to the NTIA announcement that you guys talked about there, the potential 10-year extension, you said sort of negotiations. Are you kind of submitting to the idea that everything sort of remains stable and just gets extended for 10 years on sort of the same price point and the same terms, or is there some sort of, kind of, give and take with this extension? And then, also, just as a follow-up to the quarter itself, you said, obviously, there was a spike out of China. I wonder if you could help us quantify that. Just kind of how many names are we talking about that were sort of over and above, call it, a normal run rate in Q4? Thanks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: This is Jim. Let me take the first part of your question. I would just reiterate again that what we're contemplating here, what we're working towards, is an extension of the .com agreement. So, the terms wouldn't change in the .com agreement. It is literally an extension so that it coincides with the new Root Zone Maintainer Agreement. Essentially, the goal is to make the term of those two contracts to run concurrently. That's the objective. So, we don't anticipate that there will be any substantive change or any change, actually, to the terms of the agreement itself, if that helps. Does that answer your question? Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yes, that's perfect. Thank you. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: And, Phil, with regard to your question on Q4 net adds, as discussed, net additions in the fourth quarter were 4.6 million, and they were comprised of 12.2 million new adds, new registrations, and 7.6 million deletes from prior periods. The 4.6 million was up about 3.8 million from the 800,000 we achieved in Q4 2014 and up about 2.9 million from the 1.7 million net adds delivered in Q3 2015. The Q4 year-over-year improvement was primarily a result of about 3.5 million incremental registrations coming out of our Asia-Pacific region. As we mentioned, that was primarily China and appear largely to be from the investor community over there. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Phil, this is Jim, too. Just to clarify, I want to make sure I answered entirely your first question. You were asking me about a change in terms of the .com agreement. Did you mean to implicate at all the Cooperative Agreement and the terms, for example, such as the price caps on the price of .coms? Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Both those two, the Cooperative and the .com, exactly. So the price caps, but also just the sort of presumptive right of renewal, things like that. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. So let me just say that, first of all, the terms of the .com agreement will not change, and the presumptive right of renewal, of course, would remain in the .com agreement. The .com agreement doesn't actually address pricing. That's addressed separately in the Cooperative Agreement. The Amendment 11 of the Cooperative Agreement is the section that describes our contractual relationship with NTIA with respect to the root zone maintainer role. And that is the portion that it's contemplated would essentially move into a new contract, the RZMA that we're negotiating with ICANN. Amendment 32 is a separate part of the Cooperative Agreement that addresses pricing with respect to our ability to seek a price change if we think it's justified by market conditions. So I certainly don't anticipate that that would change. That would remain. So VeriSign's right to seek relief from price controls based on market conditions that would warrant it would remain. Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Awesome. Thanks, guys. Appreciate the detail. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Just three quick questions, one on the agreements, so you did mention that it is not a renewal, it'a an extension. But I'm assuming that the Department of Commerce review would be similar to what the review would be during a renewal? I just wanted to make sure I understood what the difference was technically between an extension and renewal for those purposes. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. I don't believe that's the case. I think the extension means that the date changes on the agreement. But any change to the agreement requires the consent of the NTIA. And so, I can't speak for NTIA. This is their process. The part of the process we're involved in would be to negotiate the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement with ICANN to present that along with a .com contract that has the date extended and present that to NTIA. This is, of course, in response to their March 2015 request for a way to transition the root zone maintainer role and to take NTIA out of that process. So that will be up to them when they see it. So I think that's what they asked for and that's what they're looking for. This is not a renewal in the sense that all of the normal things that happen during a renewal would happen. So I don't quite see it that way. I see this is precisely what NTIA has called it. It's a parallel process to address the issue of the root and parallel to the IANA transition process, which began in March of 2014. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Got it. And then, George, on your end, there's been a lot of activity in the TLD space and you've had a lot of marketing dollars, I think, come into the market. And I think you even in your lawsuit with XYZ talked about having to spend more money from a \u2013 I can't remember what you called it \u2013 remedial marketing, something like that, to make sure your brand was positioned right. I'm wondering. Your guidance really doesn't seem to imply any kind of uptick in marketing spend. I'm wondering if you could just help us understand what the environment looks like, what you decided to bake in to your guide from a marketing expense perspective. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. So, from a sales and marketing perspective, we would expect that sales and marketing expense to be similar as a percent of revenue as it has been this year. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And then just lastly, you guys obviously did divestitures for a number of years. You haven't really done any M&A. Is there any update on how you're thinking about inorganic activities as it relates to your strategy in 2016 and beyond? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: This is Jim. So, in a word, no, but let me just say this. During my earlier remarks, I mentioned that the next big thing for VeriSign is more of the same. What we did for the last five years in efficiently running our business, providing security and stability, generating value, and efficiently returning that value to our shareholders; that's what you're going to see for the next five years. So, some sort of inorganic growth strategy to try to grow in other businesses or non-core businesses is not part of our plan. And I certainly don't see that happening. And we've been very consistent about that messaging. Now, I've also consistently said something else over the last year or two, which is that, for example, the new gTLD program could present some inorganic opportunities in our core business. And that's certainly still true. In fact, just recently, a group of observers of that marketplace, who are heavily involved in, all sort of opined that 2016 could be the year of consolidation in that business. And certainly those opportunities to acquire growth in our core business would be something we'd look at, and we've been very consistent about all of that. Since completing the divestitures, our position on acquisitions is essentially unchanged. But again, if we see opportunities that come along, we're not opposed to looking at those, as long as they're consistent with our core business, consistent with our commitment to deliver profitable growth. Again, the opportunity to participate in a consolidation in 2016, that's an opportunity for us. As a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 we have evaluated, and we are pursuing, and we'll continue to evaluate and pursue, acquisitions of TLDs that are currently in operation, those that have not yet been awarded, in support of our growth strategy as long as they fit with that strategy. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. That makes sense. Thanks, Jim. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. Operator : We'll now take our last question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon, guys. Jim, just, I guess, to start off to follow on to Phil's question, I just want to make sure we're on the same page here. Should the .com agreement and Cooperative Agreement get sort of rolled into this 10-year extension? If that does come to fruition, is the expectation that there would be no built-in price escalators, but that VeriSign would be able to petition if there was a change in market power or if there were some sort of unusual expense that was required of VeriSign from a security perspective to secure the DNS? Do I have that correctly? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Almost. Yes. For the most part, you have it correct. But let me just point out the .com \u2013 so the short answer to your question is yes. I don't expect any of that to change. I anticipate that we would have our Amendment 32 rights to petition based on changing market conditions for price relief. And also that, certainly, the agreement calls for the ability for VeriSign to seek so-called cost-justified price increases and that includes things like cost of implementing Consensus Policies or specific threats to the DNS that are extraordinary that we have to respond to \u2013 unanticipated expenses associated with responding to threats. So I don't see those changing at all. But in the front part of your question, you sort of lumped the .com Registry Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement together, and those are different agreements. What we're doing here is we're seeking an extension to the .com Registry Agreement. The Cooperative Agreement expires in 2018, and we are not seeking any change to that. That is up to NTIA. That is their process, their contract, so I would certainly defer to them. But we are not rolling up those two together for a 10-year extension. We are just simply ensuring that the .com Registry Agreement, which, I might add, has the most stringent SLAs, the most stringent security performance requirements of any Registry Agreement, run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement, because remember, our performance as the Root Zone Maintainer and Publisher, essentially you can think of it as the bootstrapping process of the Internet, which we do at least twice a day. And it is critically important to the secure operation of the global Internet that that process be done in an uninterrupted, secure way. And so in order to achieve that, we are seeking a concurrent term for the .com Registry Agreement, which addresses the infrastructure and the performance requirements for that infrastructure that provides the security for .com and .net and the roots to run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement for obvious reasons, to avoid any possible instability that might result. The Cooperative Agreement, the only thing that we anticipate would change \u2013 I'm not speaking for NTIA, but I assume, at some point, Amendment 11, which talks about our role as the Root Zone Maintainer would, of necessity, change. But we have no anticipation or expectation that anything else would change. It expires in 2018, but it's up to NTIA to decide at that point what happens. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Okay. Thanks for that, Jim. And then earlier, you said that you believe that deletions in Q4 could exceed additions, just given the big uptick in first-time renewals. As part of your unit growth guidance of 0.5% to 2%, if we sort of look at the mid-point of that, is that effectively what you're kind of factoring in for Q4? Just wondering how you're sort of thinking about that as part of the guidance. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, I think it is factored in. I'll let George offer you some more color on that. But I will just say that Q4 is a ways off. It is unique. We had basically roughly a 50% increase from the year ago quarter in Q4 of 2015. I think we had 8-point-something million gross adds in Q4 of 2014 and we went to 12.2 million in Q4 of 2015. So it was extraordinary in that sense. And it's technically possible that a wide range of outcomes could result. And so, I just wanted to point out that one possibility certainly is that deletes could exceed adds just because of the sheer volume of gross adds that occurred in Q4 of 2015. That is a mathematical fact and I just wanted to point it out and maybe George can add some color. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. I think that's exactly right. I mean, as Jim pointed out, last year in the fourth quarter of 2014, 8.2 million adds versus the 12.2 million adds in the fourth quarter of this year, so 4 million increase in the additions. As we historically know, first-time renewal rates are typically around 50%, so that would mathematically suggest that there's maybe a 2 million unit increase in deletions. We've also said that when we look around the world from a renewal rate perspective, we do see emerging markets having a slightly lower renewal rate, on average. So that could impact the number as well. Clearly, what would dictate Q4 net adds would be the other side of that equation as to what gross adds would be. But clearly, as we said in our prepared remarks, the renewing name base is going to be large. I mean, we had a great, great fourth quarter. And so we'll have those names come up for renewal, and we'll keep an eye on what the renewal rate is. But historically, our first-time renewal rate has been 50%. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And if I could just ask one last one, George, can you just walk through why expected cash taxes for 2016 are likely to be quite a bit lower than 2015? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. I'd be happy to. In 2015 last year, we did have some expense related to a small restructuring of a portion of our international operations, and the primary difference is that restructuring amount. Again, from a U.S. perspective, we have our convertible debenture that produces a tax shield. Last year, it was about $165 million, as we said. That convertible debenture tax shield tends to grow about 6% year-over-year. We also have approximately $173 million of foreign tax credits that we expect to utilize before they expire over the next seven or eight years. And so we don't expect to pay very much U.S. tax based on our attributes. So really we would look to the $10 million to $20 million to be primarily foreign taxes, but, again, we had a small restructuring. We talked about it last year, where we did pay some cash taxes as a result of that international restructuring. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, very helpful. Thank you, guys. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, Operator.

In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid start to 2016 for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $143 million in free cash flow. We processed nearly 10 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 2.65 million net new names ending with 142.5 million .com and .net domain names in a domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the first quarter we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents. We continue to make progress and we'll provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress towards these objectives. I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.5 million, consisting of 126.6 million names for .com and 15.9 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.3% compared with 72.5% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2016 will be approximately 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 73.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2015. As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the first quarter, we continued to see strength in net additions in many parts of the world, both from developed and emerging markets. Also during the quarter, we again saw activity coming from registrars in China that exceeded our expectations. At this point, we expect activity from registrars in China to normalize as we continue through the second quarter. Also as discussed last quarter, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a large percentage of first time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated last quarter, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the second quarter of 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names, and we are now forecasting the full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%. As an update related to the launch of our IDN versions of .com and .net, the localized Katakana version of .com in Japanese launched in December and will be in general availability starting June 13. Also, we plan to launch the .com and .net Korean IDNs in May. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totals $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income for the first quarter totaled $167 million, up 15.6% from $144 million in the first quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59.2% compared to 55.8% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $107 million compared to $88 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.82 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.66 for the first quarter last year. As of March 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $667 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at the quarter end. I'll now review some additional first quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $103 million as compared to the $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and compared with $104 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 63.3% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $112 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.79 last quarter based on 133.8 million and 133.4 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares in the first quarter compared to 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.1 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 15.8 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.4 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2015 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter were $144 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with $133 million and $126 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is an increase from the $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion revenue range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our updated expectation of full-year 2016 domain name base growth, which is now in the range of the 1% to 2.5%. Full-year 2016, non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million, lowered from the $114 million to $120 million range as given on our last earnings call. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, lowered from the $40 million to $50 million range as given on our last earnings call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million. Due to domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in the 2016 are international. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman : Thank you, George. In closing, during the first quarter, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We believe that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in a most efficient manner. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. So, I guess I'd like to ask, in terms of the revenue growth rate, revenue grew 9.1% year-over-year, but the name file grew 7.1%. Historically, if you look at those two, they've been very close to one another within 10 basis points, and here you have 200 basis points different. Do you have any insight into why the revenue growth rate might have been 200 basis points stronger than the name growth rate? George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Sure, Steve. I think a couple of factors. One, as we mentioned last quarter, we did have a .net price increase that took effect in February of this year. Also really the timing of when the ads came in, we clearly had a very strong 4Q of name additions, and we also had a very strong 1Q name additions. And so, as that revenue waterfalls, that also helped. While not material, our BFS business continue to grow in the quarter as well. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And then, you mentioned China, the expectation is that, that should normalize here in the second quarter. What gives you confidence or what leads you to believe that that's going to be the situation? George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Well, I think the short answer is, as we look at the trends, we've seen the demand that happened in the second half of the first quarter kind of ebb and flow. So we saw it come. It was pretty strong for a few weeks and then it came back to more than normalized path. So we don't have a perfect crystal ball, but based on the trends that we've seen that we've been tracking, it seems to be back on the normalized path for that particular region, at least as what we've seen historically. Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is (14:37) for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the Japanese IDN, which I believe is in the (14:44) space. (14:45) at this point, are you able to disclose the pricing for the registry fees and also what will be the subsequent IDN fee \u2013 what will the subsequent IDN fee priced similarly? Thanks. D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman : I'm sorry but that was completely unreadable on our end. I don't know if you are on a cell phone, but none of us in this room could get a word of it, I apologize. Unknown Speaker : Hello. Can you \u2013 is this better? D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman : Oh, that's much better. Unknown Speaker : Sorry. I'm sorry about that. Yeah. Just quickly, I wanted to ask about the Japanese IDN. Are you able to disclose the pricing for the registry fee at this point? And will the subsequent IDNs be priced similarly? Todd B. Strubbe - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, so in Japan \u2013 hi, this is Todd Strubbe. In Japan, we are currently in our limited release one phase and we enter a GA in June. Our pricing right now has a combination of base pricing and we have lunched premium pricing, so it's a combination. Our general availability pricing is established at $8 for the registrars and then has several tiers associated with premium pricing. Our Korea launch, we just announced, will go into Sunrise phase in May, as Jim said, with the targeted general availability for both Korea streams, the .com and the .net, in late August. And that pricing will likely be very similar to what we have priced in Japan. Unknown Speaker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Out of the 2.65 million net names that were added in the quarter, about how much of that came from Asia-Pac? George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : So, we don't break out the gross adds by particular region, but what I can tell you is the incremental names that happened in the quarter that were \u2013 kind of surprised us was about a million names. So about a million incremental names in the quarter were over and above the trend line that we typically see in China. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. And I guess, George, just getting back to your commentary on the ebbs and flows with respect to the second half of Q1 in China. If we sort of think back to Q4, if I recall, you had an extremely strong first six weeks in that quarter and then the activity seemed to die down quite a bit as well. Is the thought on normalization in Q2 a function of seasonality being stronger in Q1 versus Q4? I guess just any commentary there would be helpful. George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Yeah. Clearly, seasonality has some to do with it. Q2 tends to be a little bit less than Q1. Q1 does tend to be our strongest quarter. But when we look at the trends from that particular market, it just deviated from the normal trend that we were expecting. And then again, subsequent to the end of the quarter, it came pretty much back on our expectations. The only other color I can give you is that, in fourth quarter when we saw the demand coming out of China, that was pretty broad spread across many TLDs and across frankly many of our own TLDs, whereas the one that happened in Q1 was fairly localized to .com. I don't have intelligence for all the other TLDs per se, but I can tell you, it was much more centered at .com than the Q4 event. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just one last question. I guess either for Jim and George. So just in light of the net adds activity in Q1, and then if I take the midpoint of your Q2, new name guidance, based on my math, it looks like the high end of your new 2016 guidance for unit growth, which would be 2.5%, it looks like that would actually imply if I'm not mistaken, net deletions not only for the Q4 as you outlined in your script, but in fact for the entire second half. And just wondering if you could help me understand, I guess, why the unit growth guidance for the full year would not be higher than 1% to 2.5% or is it just a function of conservatism? George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Well, just again in Q4 since the number of incremental names was so strong, we had about 3.5 million incremental names out of a total of 12.2 million. We hadn't seen that level of activity from the investment community over there. And so, it's a little bit of a unicorn. We're not exactly sure what the renewal rates are there. And so, we're just being, I think, prudent as to estimating what renewal rates can be, because we don't quite have an experience with that particular segment of that base and how they'll perform. D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman : I think you need just think of it as a conservative approach to forecasting in a situation where we have a situation arising in Q4 that we just simply haven't seen before. We have a lot of data, and we have a lot of forecasting tools, but I think you should view that forecast in that light. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Could you help us understand as you look out at maybe 1Q 2017? I know you're not providing 2017 guidance in total. But do you expect kind of the same dynamic in that period to persist from what you're seeing in 4Q given the overage in registrations coming out of Asia in the current or in the most recent reported quarter? D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman : I think it's just too early to speculate as to what will happen in Q1, but certainly what happened in Q1 of 2016 is very different than what happened in Q4 of 2015. So, the impact that we're anticipating in Q4 of 2016 really wouldn't be the same in the subsequent quarter. And I think it's sort of a favorable development that there's more of a concentration of .com registrations in the sort of increase in activity in Q1 of 2016 So, it's early to say, but I think there's just a larger number of renewing names, that ratio that exists in Q4 of 2016 is not very likely to be the same in subsequent quarters, it almost certainly won't. George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : And the only other thing I'll say is that \u2013 when we start seeing these names start to renew late in Q3 and Q4, we'll get some additional information that will help us to answer that question for Q1 and when we provide guidance on our fourth quarter call. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. And then, just as, Jim, as it relates to the contract processes, you said you're in the final stages there. I assume the next stage here would be a posting of that contract and \u2013 posting the agreements in the public comment period. And could you just let us know what your expected dates are to have that process wrapped up? D. James Bidzos - President, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Chairman : Yeah. I can't speak for all the parties involved. So, I can't give you a date. I can just tell you that we've moved down the road in drafting the agreement and we're much further along in that process and we certainly are making progress and I'm sure that, we'll certainly know more by the next time we talk to you in the following quarter, and it's very possible that something could happen before that. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just last question for George, on the guide for the year, you did raise your revenue guidance on the back of the strengthened demands. You didn't change your margin guidance, is there a corresponding increase in spending that you're pushing through or what else would explain the difference between higher revenue and margins not going up? George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : Looking in our business with the recurring revenue model, we're clearly looking to continue to drive growth that we see various opportunities in various markets and we're trying to be flexible in making investments and marking to drive additional growth. And so we're always putting plans in place for future periods. We do have some variable costs, as it relates to the fees that are charged for domain names that we pay to ICANN as these fees right up, so we do have some variable costs there. And if you look at some of our costs quarter-over-quarter, we have been investing in the business, but, yeah, I think, what you should imply is that as revenue grows, we're looking to invest in the business and maintain margins in the range we guided to. Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our last question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo Securities. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple. So how should we think about the pace of internationalized.com and .net trans order agents (24:27) coming on or going GA over the rest of the year? And do you have any indications of early demand? George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : I think, Gray, and I think it's just too early. The limited release phase that we're in right now, those who are able to buy the .komo (24:53), the Japanese name, are limited to those who have the .com and they have to do that sort of the registrar, they have the .com, so the combination of those two has limited the addressable market in that limited release phase. So we'll really start to see once we hit general availability in the June timeframe and the 30, 60, 90 days after that. Same thing with Korea. Korea will be different in that we have both a .com and a .net there, so that will be the first time we'll test both of those strings in that market. And our follow-on plans past Korea, we're working on them and as we learn from Japan and Korea, both will help determine what we do next. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Can any of those strings hit in the second half of the year or is it just too early to say? George E. Kilguss III - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer : I think we're \u2013 we would be targeting probably two more strings by the second half of the year, maybe a third. So, we \u2013 that would be the high level plans, I'd say, but still not ready to share those yet. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. Operator : At this time, I'll turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley, CFA - Vice President, Treasury & Investor Relations : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Baird & Company, Inc. Priya Parasuraman - Wells Fargo Securities Operator : Good day everyone, welcome to VeriSign's second-quarter 2016 earnings call. Today's conference is being recorded, and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's second-quarter 2016 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the investor relations section of our VeriSign.com website. There you will also find our second-quarter 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results and our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report a solid first half of 2016 for VeriSign. Second-quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $161 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the second quarter, and added 0.78 million net new names, ending with 143.2 million common net domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong, with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign had been working on the Root Zone maintainer services agreement, and the .com registry agreement extension amendment. At the end of June, ICANN posted the RZMA for public review and the .com registry agreement amendment for public comment, after which our respective Boards of Directors will be asked to approve the agreements. After this, the .com RA extension amendment, which extends the term of the RA until November 30, 2024, will be sent to NTIA for review and approval, according to their processes. I'll comment now on second-quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.2 million, consisting of 127.5 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.3% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 74.4%, compared with 73.4% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2016 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2015. As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity, and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second quarter, as we had anticipated, activity from registrars in China normalized. Also, as discussed during the last two quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a larger than normal percentage of first-time renewing names, as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth-quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated the last two quarters, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the third-quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of 0.5 million, and between 0.5 million and 1.0 million names, and we are now forecasting full-year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2%. Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2017, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $7.46 to $8.20. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and up 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the US, and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 18.3% from $149 million in the second quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 61.5%, compared to 56.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $113 million, compared to $93 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 in the second quarter this year, compared to $0.70 for the second quarter last year. As of June 30, 2016, the Company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, and total liabilities of $3.4 billion. Assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $609 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional second-quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance. Second-quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million, as compared to the $103 million in the first quarter of 2016, and $102 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in expenses is primarily a result of seasonally lower employer payroll tax withholdings in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.4%, compared to 61.3% in the same quarter of 2015. The improved margin performance in the quarter was aided by our strong net add performance in the first quarter, and the timing of some sales and marketing expenditures being moved to the second half of the year. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 130.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2015, and $0.85 last quarter, based on 133.3 million and 131.6 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.9 million shares, based on the average share price during the second quarter, compared with 17 million for the same quarter in 2015, and 21.1 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first-quarter 2016 repurchase activity, and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $161 million, compared with $175 million and $171 million respectively for the second quarter last year. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.130 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our current outlook and our updated expectation of full-year 2016 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2%. Full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash taxes for the year are also still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million, due to our domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. In summary, the Company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. In closing, during the second quarter, we continued to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value to our shareholders. Since the start of this quarter, the Company achieved two important milestones. First, we marked 19 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people, and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more important. Second, we were informed earlier this month by the Chinese government that we are now licensed to provide domain name registry services for .com and .net in the PRC. We believe that .com and .net are the first non-China based registries to be fully licensed in China. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions, and operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. One question for George, and then for Jim. George, on the OpEx, when you did, looks like it was pretty constrained in the first half of the year, you mentioned some marketing programs. Is that typical with what you've done in past years? It doesn't seem like they've really stepped down necessarily the margins in the second half, and I'm wondering how this year might be different in terms of what you're driving in the business. George Kilguss : Sure, Walter. As you mentioned, if you look at our marketing expenses, sales and marketing expenses, they were actually flat sequentially, but they were down year-over-year by about $4 million. There are a number of programs that we run, some that we direct specifically that we take a look at, others that -- programs that we open up to registrars to submit programs to us. As we evaluate some of those programs that come in for us, clearly we're looking at those to see if it's going to have the right impact for our business, and if it's going to generate positive returns for us. Sometimes some of those programs that get submitted are not that attractive for us, and so we look to solicit additional proposals from registrars, as well as redirecting some of our programs. Depending on what's going on around the globe, as you might expect, there's a number of geopolitical things happening, and so we take those and other factors into place. I don't think there's anything unique here, other than we do have some programs that we did not execute on in the second half of -- the first half of the year, and we expect to execute on those in the second half of the year. So we're expecting our sales and marketing expense to increase in the second half of the year. Walter Pritchard : And then for Jim, on the IDNs, I know that Korea and Japan have rolled out, I think we're pretty early still in the process, but would love to hear any update on registration volumes, how we should maybe look at those in terms of the ramp of volumes versus what we see in other gTLDs, and any sort of update on that process. Jim Bidzos : Sure, I'll let Todd give you a little color on the progress of our IDNs. I'll just say upfront that remember that we're roughly six months into our IDN program. We started in Japan. It was the very first one. We're learning from that. We're working with partners and introducing new products. There are some infrastructure challenges, and that there are a lot of Internet applications that don't fully support IDNs, so there's some things that are continuing to develop. We try to strike a balance between adoption, growth and revenue. So there are a lot of factors that go into this. It's a little bit early. I don't think we're going to be able to give you a lot of detail, but Todd, if you want to add anything to that? Todd Strubbe : Not a lot of detail. Just we are launched in Japan, and we are in general availability. We launched in Korea earlier with two IDNs, and we're in our limited release phase there, and we'll go into general availability on August 30. We don't publish our zone there, but you can see the stats on places like nTLDstats.com. Walter Pritchard : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from with Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Matt Broome : Thanks very much. This is Matt Broome on for Gregg. So you had very little zone growth in the month of July. Can you walk through why the net add activities have been a lot weaker than what we usually see, as well as what gives you the confidence that things will pick up over the rest of the quarter? Jim Bidzos : Sure. As you point out, July we've had I think about 133,000 adds quarter to date so far. It's not that different from last year. We typically, when we look at the third quarter results we expect to pick up typically more in the latter half of the quarter. That tends to be a trend that we've seen historically, at least. But right now, if you were to straight line the net adds that we've had, you'd come to about 453,000. Clearly, we're expecting that to pick up right around the quarter, just based on seasonal trends we've seen previously. Matt Broome : Okay. Great. Out of the 780,000 net adds in Q2, roughly I guess how much of that came from China? Jim Bidzos : We don't break out our net adds by country. China continued to perform well for us this year, but so did the US, which is clearly our largest market, and EMEA continued to perform well for us as well. Matt Broome : Okay. And then just one last one, if you could -- well, what's the latest I guess on timing around the ICANN contract extension for .com? That's it from me. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Sure. The .com extension amendment to our registry agreement is out for comment. That period ends in -- on August 12. After that, the Root Zone maintainer agreement and the .com extension contract both will be -- need to be approved by VeriSign's Board of Directors and ICANN's Board of Directors. After that, they'll be given to NTIA for approval according to NTIA's processes. The only firm date I can give you at this point is the close of the comment period on August 12, and then it's a series of approvals following that. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we move next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes thanks. Hi guys. Just following on that line of questions, I frequently get the question as whether, as part of this process or maybe soon thereafter, would you revisit the pricing situation with the Department of Commerce and have the market study done again, or is that really going to be thought of as separate and maybe sometime down the road? Todd Strubbe : Sterling, I assume you're talking about the opportunity available to the Company to pursue some review of our pricing? Sterling Auty : Correct. Todd Strubbe : That's what you're talking about? Yes, unrelated to the .com extension, unrelated to the Root Zone maintainer agreement. I really can't comment on when we would do that. I would say what I've said before in the past, that I believe that there is some data that's trending favorably for us, in that ICANN has now crossed over 1,000 new gTLDs delegated to the root. I'm trying not to be too understated, but more than ample consumer choice for new gTLDs for consumers to choose from, and many of these TLDs are priced higher than .com. That data is helpful, but I really can't comment on when we might do that. I think there are a lot of factors we'd consider, and there's a process that we'd follow, but I'm not able to give you any information about exactly when we might do that. Sterling Auty : Okay. That's fair. And then on the talk of the marketing programs that appear to be shifting to the second half, if I'm not mistaken, I think we were in a similar situation last year, and the year before. What is the drivers behind the timing of it? And can you remind us, did you end up spending those programs in the back half in each of the last two years, or in some cases, would you potentially decide not to spend that money? George Kilguss : Well, I think in general, Sterling, look, if we can find marketing programs that generate positive rates of return for us and drive shareholder growth, I want to spend as much money in sales and marketing to accomplish that. Clearly, as we get a number of proposals, we offer these programs open to every single registrar, and so they're allowed to submit them. We have to evaluate them. So we clearly want to make sure that the ones that we're pursuing and accepting meet certain financial criteria. To some degree, it really depends on the proposals that are being submitted to us. Others we direct, as I mentioned to an earlier caller, we're taking a variety of things into consideration. We're marketing globally, we're looking at certain markets, and there are clearly are things that happen, whether it be, I don't know, a Brexit, or whether it be something that goes on in Turkey or other areas, we may choose to delay a program, or because of other factors outside of our control. So there's a variety of things that we take into consideration. Last year we did spend more money. We did spend money in the second half of the year. But again, there's a variety of factors that come to lumpiness. Our intention is to invest dollars into the market that will drive incremental profitable growth for the business. So, hopefully that answers your question. Sterling Auty : Yes, it does. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our last question from -- our next question from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steven Ashley : Thank you very much. I think I'd just like to ask the first question on the renewal rates, which have improved here, especially in the first quarter, but still at a good level here. Is that just mix of first-time renewals being lower as a percentage of total, or have you seen any change in first-time renewal rates there? Thank you. George Kilguss : Yes, thanks for the question. So you're correct, our renewal rates are up about 1% year-over-year, our preliminary renewal rate in the quarter is 73.7%, as Jim mentioned, up from 72%. The improvement we're seeing is primarily in the previously renewed rate. That's up about 80 basis points year-over-year from about 82.7% a year ago to 83.5% this year. And that improvement in the previously renewed rate, we're seeing that both in U.S. and international markets. On our first time renewal rate, it's also up slightly, but we're primarily seeing that improvement in the U.S. market. On average, that first-time renewal rate is still around the 50% range, though. Steven Ashley : Okay. Gross margins, 83.6%. I think that's the highest number we may have ever seen. What is contributing to that improvement? Is that sustainable? George Kilguss : Again, Steve, we look to manage all our expenses, not particularly a particular line item -- in a particular line item. I mean, we've also had slightly lower registration fees in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So because there tends to be more new names in the first quarter, we tend to have higher registration fees for ICANN, than we have in the second quarter. So it's a little seasonal dip there from that. But we continue to look at our expenses across the board, add resources where we feel it's appropriate, but in total, we're really focused on that total non-GAAP operating expense as a key metric that we're looking to manage. Steven Ashley : And in terms of the range of outcomes we could see from the Department of Commerce, if we get through the Board approval of VeriSign, if we get through the Board approval of ICANN, if this is sent to the Department of Commerce for approval, is the range of outcomes either thumbs up or thumbs down, or could they separate the two, and say we're willing to do the Root Zone but .com we want back on the old schedule? I'm just wondering if you have any color around that. Jim Bidzos : The fundamental rationale for the two agreements is addressing the priority, as called for by NTIA of security and stability in the Root Zone. And that's the reason that the .com agreement is being extended, so that it can be coterminous with the Root Zone maintainer agreement. The two agreements are related in that sense. So hopefully that helps you understand that the two agreements are really part of an effort to provide security and stability during this transition process of Root Zone oversight from NTIA to ICANN. I think in that sense, you view them as part of an effort to assure security and stability during a transition process. Steven Ashley : Thank you. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We will take our last question from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Priya Parasuraman : This is actually Priya Parasuraman for Gray. Just a quick one from me. Could you talk about what's going on in China and whether you expect things to normalize there, and does the fact that you've been licensed change anything? George Kilguss : Sure, Priya. As we talked about last quarter, we did expect the China volumes to normalize and at least in the second quarter, they absolutely did normalize for us. So at least what we're currently seeing is those are at much more normal levels. As far as the license agreement, I don't really -- I don't have any particular expectations. We've always operated in China. We've done well there. I think our brand is quite strong there. I don't really have any change of expectation, just related to the license, to how we perform. Anything you want to add, Jim? Jim Bidzos : Yes, I think the license is important, but we have been operating with the approval of the Chinese government for a period of time, as they introduce new processes for their local registrars to follow. There was a new licensing regime that was announced some time ago. We've been in that process for a period of time, and as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we now are the -- as far as we know, the first registries, .com and .net to be approved. So we are licensed for those registries to operate in China, which is important, although we did expect that process would yield the result that it did. So I don't see any interruption in the availability of our products and their operation in China, so I think it's certainly an important milestone for us, but one that we've been working with the Chinese government on for a period of time. That in and of itself I don't expect to change anything from the registrant point of view. It just simply enables to registrars to comply with local law. Priya Parasuraman : Thank you. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : This does conclude our presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

Baird Walter Pritchard - Citi Operator : Good day everyone, welcome to VeriSign\u2019s Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded, and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign\u2019s third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our VeriSign.com website. There you will also find our third quarter 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results and our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today\u2019s call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open up the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report another solid third for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. Before I get into the third quarter results I want to comment on two areas of focus for the Company. First, last week VeriSign issued an 8-K detailing the completion of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement, or RZMA, and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. The RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN is now effective and VeriSign has been discharged from those responsibilities under the Cooperative Agreement. Additionally, NTIA approved the .com extension, which extends the .com Registry Agreement between VeriSign and ICANN until November 30, 2024 to coincide with the term of the RZMA. VeriSign agreed to cooperate with NTIA as it determines whether to exercise their right to extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement before it expires on November 30, 2018. Second, as we stated earlier this year, a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 was to evaluate for acquisition top-level domains that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded. Consistent with this strategy, as announced in August, VeriSign entered into an agreement for the future assignment of the .web TLD. While there are still steps that need to occur before we become the registry operator for .web, we are excited about the .web opportunity as we believe that we are well-positioned to make it successful. I will comment now on third quarter operating highlights. We reported revenue of $288 million, up 8.2% year-over-year and we delivered strong financial performance, including $165 million in free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with 144.1 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter we continued our share repurchase program 2.2 million shares for $177 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of September the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.1 million consisting of 128.4 million .com registrations and 15.8 million .net registrations. This represents an increase of 6.6% year-over-year and a net increase of 0.9 million domain name registrations from the end of the second quarter. During the quarter we processed 8.3 million new registrations. In the second quarter of 2016 the renewal rate was 73.8% compared with 72.7% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2016 will be approximately 72.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2015. There are many factors that drive domain growth. These include but are not limited to Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations, primarily from our registrars in China. The volume of these new registrations has been inconsistent and periodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016 reverted back to a more normalized registration pace. Also, as discussed the last three quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the value of domain name registrations up for renewal - the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these registrations will be, due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base we still expect fourth-quarter deletions to be elevated with many of these deletions occurring towards the end of the fourth quarter. Based on these and other factors, we expect the full-year 2016 domain name base growth range of between 1% and 2% despite a net decrease to the domain name base of between 1.5 million and 2.8 million registrations in the fourth quarter. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $288 million up 8.2% year-over-year. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S., and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the third quarter totaled $175 million, up 13.2% from $154 million in the third quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 60.8%, compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $114 million, compared to $92 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 in the third quarter this year, compared to $0.70 for the third quarter last year. As of September 30, 2016, the Company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion, and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $421 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. I\u2019ll now review some additional third quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full-year guidance. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the second quarter of 2016, and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 65.3%, compared to 62.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 127.7 million shares. This compares to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2015, and $0.91 last quarter, based on 131.7 million and 130.6 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. Dilution related to the convertible debenture was 20.8 million shares, based on the average share price during the third quarter, compared with 18 million for the same quarter in 2015, and 21.9 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter 2016 repurchase activity, and the weighted effect of the 2.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $168 million and free cash flow was $165 million for the third quarter compared with $155 million and $157 million respectively for the third quarter last year. With respect to full-year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1.130 billion to $1.140 billion range given on our last earnings call. Full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 63.5% and 64.5%, increased from the 62.5% to 64% range provided during the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $30 million and $35 million, decreased from the $35 million and $45 million range given on our last call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international, primarily as a result of domestic tax attributes including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. In summary, the Company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2016. Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. In closing, during the third quarter we continued to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long-term lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We believe the two developments I speak of, the .com extension and our move to becoming the registry operator for the .web extension will result in security and stability for our customers and our business as well as long-term growth opportunities for the Company. We will now take your questions. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. Want to start with - can you help us really understand the net impacts from both the .com extension and the signing of the Root Zone Maintainer? It feels like there was a number of moving parts, but maybe summarize the net impacts of both of those on the business. James Bidzos : Sure, Sterling. Let me try to just, I guess, factually state what\u2019s actually changed. First of all, the IANA transition was completed and the IANA contract between NTIA and ICANN was allowed to sunset. So ICANN is now accountable to the community under enhanced accountability mechanisms. Second, the term of VeriSign\u2019s .com Registry Agreement with ICANN is now extended to November 30, 2024. So, the next renewal cycle for .com will be in 2024 not in 2018. Third, the Root Zone Maintainer portion of the transition is now complete, as VeriSign will continue the Root Zone maintenance function it has historically performed, but now under a new contract called the RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN. Fourth, there are two amendments to the Cooperative Agreement between VeriSign and NTIA. Amendment 33 discharges VeriSign from its Root Zone maintenance responsibilities and Amendment 34 approved the extension of the .com agreement to 2024 and gives NTIA the right to extend the Cooperative Agreement past its current expiration of 2018. It also allows NTIA to conduct a public interest review for purposes of making the extension decision. And also VeriSign still has the right, I would point out, under Amendment 32, to seek removal of the pricing restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement if we demonstrate to the Department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions. Those are the basic, factual changes in all of these various events of the last 30 days or so. Sterling Auty : One follow-up to it on that last point. So, if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to expire, what does that mean for pricing? Do you automatically get the ability to raise prices? Will you seek a request from the DOJ? So what happens on the pricing front if the Cooperative Agreement does go away? James Bidzos : So, if NTIA decides - and it\u2019s their process and their decision - but if they do decide to allow the Cooperative Agreement to sunset, as opposed to exercising their right to extend it - so, I don\u2019t want to speculate on that process because that\u2019s NTIA\u2019s decision whether to sunset it or extend it beyond 2018. I can tell you that we agreed to work with NTIA as they go through their process and make the decision. However, I would point out one thing, which is that if there\u2019s a change to, or a termination of, or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, the .com Registry Agreement itself contains something called the Cooperation Clause that states that VeriSign and ICANN will negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the Registry Agreement, the .com Registry Agreement, as necessary for consistency with changes to, or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, if that helps. Sterling Auty : It does, but kind of still leaves a little bit of ambiguity. So, if it goes away and you renegotiate with ICANN, I would imagine one of the things that, if I\u2019m in your shoes you would be interested in is negotiating back the ability to raise prices. Or would you still be under a consent decree of the Department of Justice through 2024 to keep .com prices capped? James Bidzos : So, I think I can answer part of that. I\u2019m just trying to avoid speculating. But in your scenario, if you are assuming that the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset and there is no other contractual relationship or provision or restrictions - relationship between DOJ, DOC and VeriSign, then VeriSign would negotiate in good faith, as we are both required to under the agreement, with ICANN to effect whatever changes need to be effected as a result of the sunset of the Cooperative Agreement. So, that certainly would include pricing, but I don\u2019t want to speculate what that would look like today. Sterling Auty : Okay. Last item. So just to clarify then, really the cap on pricing that the DOJ effectively helped put into place is not like when a DOJ steps in and declares a company a monopoly and puts in a consent decree where they have direct oversight and capping. You are saying that the price agreement that the DOJ market power study helped is really just entirely encapsulated within the Cooperative Agreement? James Bidzos : I believe that\u2019s correct. It\u2019s a fact that the relationship that we have with NTIA is the mechanism by which the price caps are imposed on.com and that NTIA, where appropriate for its oversight through the Cooperative Agreement, consults with DOJ on issues of competitive issues, et cetera. So, if that went away there would be at that point - if that\u2019s all that happened and the Cooperative Agreement sunset and there is no other contractual relationship that we have at this point. We don\u2019t have that type of relationship that you described upfront in your question. Sterling Auty : Makes sense. Thank you, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Steve Ashley : Great. Well, I\u2019m going to just pick up right where Sterling left off and just keep drilling down. So, because it is something we are all very interested in, if the Cooperative Agreement sunsets, who will control pricing? And you talked Jim about you would negotiate with ICANN. Would ICANN have the authority to set pricing, veto pricing? What we are just trying to understand where authority for setting and enforcing pricing would reside if the Cooperative Agreement sunsets on November 18, 2018. James Bidzos : I don\u2019t want to speculate on what that process in detail would look like and, therefore, it\u2019s hard to say where it would come out. But it would, according to the language that\u2019s in the documents today, it would be the result of a good-faith negotiation between VeriSign and ICANN. Essentially, the DOC is not in the picture if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset. So, having said that, I would say that trying to determine what that will yield I think would be speculating. But I would observe that ICANN\u2019s policies at least are fairly consistent in how they\u2019ve applied pricing across TLD, certainly since the new gTLD program. There are a number of legacy TLDs, of course like .com and .net and .org and others. But it\u2019s just difficult to speculate on a process that only gets invoked under a set of circumstances that are two years away. I think the main point is that the pricing imposed on .com at least since 2006 has come directly from DOC, so that mechanism goes away. But in terms of what happens and who has the authority, it\u2019s a good-faith negotiation between VeriSign and ICANN. That much is factual. Steve Ashley : Great. And then I would just like to ask a question on deferred revenue. It declined sequentially from - not a lot, a little bit, for the second time consecutively. That hasn\u2019t been kind of the norm over the past years. Is there any comment around the small sequential decline in deferred revenue we are seeing? George Kilguss : Nothing other than it typically does slow down as the year progresses. Typically, at least historically we used to have very large registrations in the first quarter, so we\u2019d get a bump in deferred revenue and it would decline sequentially over the years. More recently that bump in Q1 has gotten less and so some of the changes year-over-year have rolled through, but nothing material that I am aware of, Steve. Steve Ashley : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Hi. Thanks. Two questions. One on - you\u2019ve been pretty clear on the Q4 trajectory given what happened last year. Can you talk about how you look at that into Q1? George Kilguss : So, Walter this is George. We\u2019ll give you Q1 guidance on our fourth quarter call. But, again, the reason for the large range that we put in place this particular quarter is the fact that it was a fairly large amount of names that came up for renewal, or will come up for renewal in this quarter. And the cohort, or the type of names that they are, they are related to a Chinese investment community, we really don\u2019t have a tremendous amount of data around that. And so we are really waiting to take a look at those names as they come up for renewal in the middle of November and early December we will get a better look at that, and once we have a better look at that it will give us a little more clarity into Q1. But we have always said, the Q4 is a relatively unique event. There\u2019s over 4 million names that are really coming up for renewal as a result of the demand that happened last year. And so we are really waiting to take a look at that before we provide guidance to Q1. Walter Pritchard : And then, George, just on the expenses, you had a very good I guess, the expenses very low, declining year-over-year by about 3% in the quarter. Can you talk about the sustainability, I guess, first the source of the expense decline year-over-year and then the sustainability of that trajectory as you look into Q4 and beyond? George Kilguss : Yes. I would say, as you have commented on, I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of trying to keep expenses level. When you talk about year-over-year you are looking at the third quarter. And I think it\u2019s probably more appropriate to look at the nine months because things can move from quarter-to-quarter. And when I look at the nine months on a non-GAAP basis, expenses in total are down a little bit. You are correct there. But we are seeing some movement between the groups. So, we\u2019ve seen an increase in our cost of goods sold. We\u2019ve got more labor going on there. Sales and marketing, we\u2019ve talked about that. It\u2019s been lower, but we do have an intention to put more money to work there and I would think that\u2019s really more of a timing function. R&D is down. We have reduced labor there. As we talked about last quarter, I believe we did close our Indian Development Corporation over there last year and so we are getting some benefits from a labor perspective through the P&L at the present time. And then G&A is up a little bit. We do have some slightly higher labor and we\u2019ve incurred some higher legal costs this quarter. As far as your questions to the sustainability, we really try to manage the total expense of the Company, the entire $400 million number on an annual basis. And we try to allocate those dollars to where they are. Clearly, we try to gain efficiencies, but at the same time we are not starving the business. And as you know, our business is relatively dynamic. As the cyber environment continues to evolve we absolutely want to make sure we put enough resources into maintaining the security and stability of the business. So, we will continue to be vigilant on that, but to date we\u2019ve done a good job of keeping them in the range where they\u2019ve been historically. Walter Pritchard : Great. Thank you. Operator : We are taking a follow-up question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. That\u2019s also our final question. Sterling Auty : Yes, just a housekeeping follow-up question. Can you remind us what the total number of names that are up for renewal in the fourth quarter and if you are willing to give it for the first quarter, so March actually, are? George Kilguss : Yes, a couple of data points. The names that were up for renewal this quarter was 28.7 million and the names that are up for Q4 are going to be 32 million names that are up for renewal. Sterling Auty : All right. Great. And how about March 2017, or is it too early to give that? George Kilguss : I would say it\u2019s too early for that at this point. Sterling Auty : And actually - and maybe one other we didn\u2019t touch upon. So, early here in the quarter, so you\u2019ve got the guidance for the decline in the base, but there was a pop, actually, in the Zone file of like 350,000 names the one-week, including a pretty healthy pop in .net. Anything that you can ascribe the jump to? George Kilguss : Yes, we ran some marketing activities in the quarter around .net and they were actually relatively successful. And so the team is evaluating programs to see if we want to run some more of those. But we had a marketing program basically, and those numbers are roughly right, about 300 names came in from those marketing programs. Sterling Auty : And when you talk about those marketing programs, are these different than - I think about in the past that you ran marketing programs with registrars at the end market to spur demand, but are these those types of things, or are these incentives where maybe you are giving discount on registry fees on .net above certain thresholds, or anything like that? George Kilguss : The programs vary from program to program. This was more of a program we were looking to see if we were in a short-term program what would be the effect of. Sometimes we run programs throughout the year, much longer-term programs and we are questioning the effectiveness of those compared to some shorter-rate programs, shorter-term programs, and this one was a relatively short program. We just want to understand the duration of programs and get some feedback as we think about 2017. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you much. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to David Atchley for closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Once again that does conclude today\u2019s call. We appreciate your participation.",

Analysts: Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter, which capped another solid year for VeriSign. The year marked some significant milestones for the Internet community and for VeriSign with the completion of the IANA transition, our signing of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement with ICANN, and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment, which extends the .com Registry Agreement until the end of November 2024. Our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. During 2016, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1.142 billion in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $666 million, and producing full-year 2016 non-GAAP operating margins of 64.5%. Operationally, 2016 was a solid year for the company. VeriSign processed 35.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations, and finished the year with 142.2 million .com and .net names in the domain name base. During the year, we marked more than 19 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. As part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2 million shares for $160 million. During the full year 2016, we repurchased 7.8 million shares for $637 million. Effective today, the board of directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $641 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the year. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.2 million, consisting of 126.9 million names for .com and 15.3 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 1.7% year-over-year. As noted in prior conference calls, the fourth quarter of 2016 was somewhat unique, as the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter had a larger than normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations due to the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 2015, coming from China investors. As first-time renewing names have a lower renewal rate than previously renewed names, fourth quarter 2016 deletes were elevated and resulted in the domain name base decrease of 1.9 million net names after processing 8.8 million new gross registrations during the quarter. This larger percentage of first-time renewing names is also leading to an overall preliminary fourth quarter 2016 renewal rate of 67.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2015. In the third quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73% compared with 71.9% for the same quarter of 2015. While activity from China has normalized over the last few quarters, the China names surge of late 2015 declined, but did carry over into the first quarter of 2016. As a result, we expect this small group of names to contribute to a slight increase in deletes towards the end of the current Q1 and the beginning of Q2. Based on these and other factors, we expect full year 2017 domain name base growth of between 0.5% and 2.5%, with an increase to the domain name base of between 0.7 million and 1.2 million registrations in the first quarter. Now I'd like to provide two updates before handing the call over to George. First, as it relates to our becoming the registry operator for .web, on January 18, 2017, the company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, requesting certain information related to VeriSign's potential operations of the .web TLD. The CID is not directed at VeriSign's existing registry agreements. As we said at the time of the auction last July, we strongly believe VeriSign is well-positioned to grow and widely distribute .web to provide an additional option to the marketplace, given our proven track record of reliability and stability, and we look forward to explaining our views as we respond to the CID and continue to cooperate with the DOJ. Second, we continually evaluate the strategic opportunities for our business and, as you may have seen earlier today, we have decided it is in the best interests to sell our iDefense business to Accenture. As part of this sale, VeriSign will continue as an iDefense customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. The announcement of the iDefense sale only relates to iDefense and is not a sale of our other VeriSign security services offerings, including DDoS Protection and Managed DNS. The terms of this transaction are not being disclosed and the financials associated with this business are not material to our overall business. We anticipate closing in the next few months, subject to customary closing conditions. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the company generated revenue of $1.142 billion, up 7.8% from fiscal 2015, and delivered GAAP operating income of $687 million, up 13% from $606 million for the full year 2015. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $286 million, up 5% year-over-year and down 0.4% sequentially. The small sequential decline was a result of the 1.9 million reduction in the domain name base during the quarter that Jim discussed earlier. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter totaled $169 million, up 6.6% from $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $106 million compared to $102 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.84 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.76 for the fourth quarter last year. As of December 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $368 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full year guidance. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $14 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to $100 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing expenses deployed in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 63.9% compared to 62.4% in the same quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $115 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92, based on a weighted average diluted share count of 125.5 million shares. This compares to $0.79 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.93 last quarter, based on 133.4 million and 127.8 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 20.6 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter, compared with 21.4 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 20.8 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow was $195 million and free cash flow was $198 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $189 million and $176 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. With respect to full year 2017 guidance, the financial guidance that I will provide reflects the expected completion of the iDefense asset sale within the next few months. Revenue for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $1.138 billion to $1.158 billion. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And finally, cash taxes for the year are expected to be between $15 million and $25 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2017 are international, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. These convertible debentures continue to generate cash tax benefits while they remain outstanding, and they are an important part of our capital structure. Although we will have the right to redeem these debentures under the terms of the indentures starting in August of 2017, our intention, based on current conditions, is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefit to continue to accrue. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. In closing, during the last year, we expanded our work to protect, grow, and manage the business, while continuing our focus to provide long-term value to our shareholders. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : We will take our first question from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Thanks very much. Close enough there. Hi, guys. First question, you mentioned the Q4 renewal rates are expected to be 67.5%. Was there any change in renewal rates outside of China in the quarter? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Gregg, thanks for the question. In general, our renewal rates both domestically and internationally have been relatively consistent with one another. But the vast majority of the decline that we saw in our international renewal rates is really related to the China names. That was the biggest factor. Everything else stayed relatively consistent for us. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay. Perfect. Thanks, George. And then, within the Q1 net add guidance, are you assuming essentially the same renewal rates from China that you saw in Q4? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. For the group of names that are similar \u2013 the group of names \u2013 it was about 750,000 to 1 million names that came in in the first quarter of 2016 that was also from, what we believe to be, the China investor phenomena. We expect those to have similar renewal rates as the names that renewed in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC: Perfect. And then just a couple other quick ones, if I may. I understand and certainly can appreciate that you don't want to get overly granular with respect to the iDefense contribution. Having said that, the 2017 revenue guidance is below where the Street was, and just \u2013 I think any sort of additional color you might be able to provide, even if not getting, again, overly granular, might just be helpful in sort of reconciling where the Street was previously versus your guidance today. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. I think there're a variety of factors that go into our revenue guidance, which is $1.138 billion to $1.158 billion for next year. Clearly, we had a very strong 2016, we were up 7.8% in 2016 versus 4.9% in 2015. And as we've talked about, a lot of that revenue growth was from a unique event, which was attributed to the strong China investor community. And as we've mentioned, about a third of those names renewed in the fourth quarter. So we do have some names, as I just mentioned, coming up in the first quarter that should, if they had the same renewal rate, will delete out of the zone sometime in the late first quarter, early second quarter. And so that's part of what's influencing it. Also to a lesser extent, you're correct, the iDefense business, we expect that revenue to get out of the business as we close this transaction. And so without disclosing any details on the iDefense business, which we're not, I would say it's really those two factors that are giving our view of revenue today, and as always we'll update our guidance each quarter as we get more visibility into the year. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC: Okay, great. And then just one last one for Jim, just following-up on the Civil Investigative Demand from the DOJ with respect to .web. What would be the sort of the procedure and timeline from here just as you understand it? Thanks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. Well, I think in my comments I not only said all I should. I think I said all there really is to say at this point. There's no information beyond what I told you. I can give you a little bit more color, I guess. We've certainly said in the past that inorganic growth is part of our growth strategy, and sometimes regulatory review becomes part of that process. So we received the CID, which is kind of like a subpoena. We've been discussing it with the DOJ since shortly after we received it, and we've provided some information already and we're continuing to cooperate. So like I said in my remarks, we believe we're well positioned to grow .web. We think that the industry is extremely competitive. Beyond that, it's just too early in the process to say anything beyond that. It's just speculation and I really can't do that. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC: Fair enough. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : We will take our next question from Gray Powell of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Just a couple questions, if I may. So it looks like .com is showing a decent recovery in growth over the last month, but .net does remain under some pressure. Is there any residual churn issue on .net or should we just expect more muted growth there on that domain going forward? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, .net was also impacted by the China activity in 2015, and so we did see some of .net names also churn out of the zone in the fourth quarter of 2016. The .net is still a great brand for us globally. It's well-recognized. It continues to do well in markets internationally, as well as domestically. But there is a lot of choice in the domain name industry, and there is clearly competition, whether it be from ccTLDs or other technologies. But we still are looking to drive demand in .net, and it's still a great brand for us globally. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Certainly, .net is not the brand that .com is. Com is a stronger brand, but there are 15.3 million .net registrations. It's a globally recognized and a trusted brand. It had, in the past couple of years, actually dipped briefly below 15 million names, and it's recovered. So I think its growth trajectory is just a little bit different than .com, but it's still a very, very strong and recognized brand. It's the second largest generic TLD behind com. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Understood. Okay. That's helpful. And then could you give an update on foreign language versions of .com and .net that you're introducing? Just how many are up and running today? What kind of traction are they seeing? And then, just what's the schedule for the remaining domains going forward? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Todd, do you want to... Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. Well, we currently have three of the transliterations of com and net generally available. That's two of the Korean or Hangul transliterations, one for com and one for net, and then the Japanese or Katakana script of .com. At this point, we're not providing any additional details on other launches. As we mentioned last quarter, we do continue to work on our licensing process to operate the Chinese IDNs, and we will update as we develop our plans further. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Unknown Speaker : Hi. This is (21:43) in for Sterling. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask as a follow-up on the iDefense sale. Can you talk a little more about the timing and the rationale of the sale, and if there are any plans for divesting the securities business? And then also my second question is just on other revenue in the quarter. It seems a little bit higher than what we expected. So if there is anything else driving that? Any color there would be really helpful. Thank you. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: I don't know if you're on a cell phone. The very end of that was a little difficult to understand. You said that other revenue was a little bit higher in the quarter, and then you said something else that I think at least I wasn't able to get. Unknown Speaker : Can you \u2013 is it better now? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: A little. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah, a little. Try again, please. I got your first question. Unknown Speaker : I was just asking about the other revenue, if anything (22:43) if anything was different this quarter. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Okay. Unknown Speaker : Yeah. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: So let me address your first question about iDefense. I think you were asking about strategic rationale. We've certainly said consistently that we are certainly better suited to be a consumer rather than a producer of threat intelligence. Our primary business is, obviously, the secure and stable operation of infrastructure supporting .com and .net. That's our primary mission. That's the most important thing that we do. We, obviously, need good cyber defenses in order to do that, but we will continue to be an iDefense customer and receive it, but it's a little different than the other security services. And as I mentioned in my remarks, this is specifically iDefense. It's not our Managed DNS business and it's not our DDoS Protection businesses. So I think it's just sort of a logical sort of business procession for us. Your other question was about other revenue, and I'll ask George maybe to address that. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. So, there was nothing unusual in the quarter. I'm not sure how your models track our revenue performance, but nothing unusual from an other revenue perspective. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. If I can just throw out some additional color for you. I mean, we've had, as you know, a number of different growth initiatives and we did monetize some patents in 2016 and we expect to do so in 2017 as well. But the amount is not material. We've adjusted our growth efforts to align with a rapidly changing domain name market. Some of those changes include shifts in traditional channels for domain names, possible secondary market activity and corresponding changes to how we invest in marketing. So, while we're planning to realize 2017 revenue from these other efforts, we don't expect it to be material and none of it's in our guidance. Operator : We will take our final question from Jason Velkavrh of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. The first question is on the expense side. I believe last quarter you mentioned an intent to put a little more money to work in sales and marketing. I was just hoping you could provide some more color around this. And if that took place this quarter, sort of what initiatives that is going towards? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Jason, I'd be happy to. So if you looked at the quarter from a non-GAAP basis, we had about $103 million of expenses in the quarter. That was up about $3 million from the third quarter, where we had about $100 million. And the majority, if not all of that increase, was spent in the marketing area. We continue to partner with our registrars to put more marketing dollars in various markets to drive domain name growth. And so we were able to put that money to work and we continue to look to opportunities to partner with registrars to do that in markets that we think can drive profitable growth for us. Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And then a question on the new gTLDs, the .com, .net transliterations. Realized it's a small base and early, but just curious there. What are you seeing there in terms of renewal rates for those that have lapsed versus what you see for .com and .net? Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.: We haven't really \u2013 the general availability for the earliest ones was not until second quarter of 2016, so we're not up to our first year. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah, we haven't lapped yet. Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah, don't have (26:30) Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. Do you have an expectation for that to be any different or do you expect that to be around the same? Todd B. Strubbe - VeriSign, Inc.: I think it's too early to tell. They are such a different product. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah, we don't guide to the renewal rates, but there is only a few more months and that information will be available. Jason Velkavrh - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Okay. That's all I had. Thanks for the questions. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Mr. David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. That concludes our call. Have a good evening.",

Today's conference is being recorded, and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I will turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There, you will also find our first quarter 2017 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC; specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $0.96, up 12% year-over-year, and $139 million in free cash flow. As part of managing our business during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.6 million, consisting of 128.4 million names for .com and 15.2 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.4 million net names during the first quarter, after processing 9.5 million new gross registrations. The U.S. market contributed to the better-than-expected performance. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2017 will be approximately 72.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the final renewal rate was 67.6%, compared with 73.3% for the same quarter of 2015. As noted in our prior conference calls, the portion of registrations associated with the China name search that occurred in the first quarter of 2016 continued to renew at lower-than-historic first time renewal rates in the first and second quarter of 2017, and are contributing to slightly higher deletions in the first half of 2017. In addition, Q2 tends to have slightly lower seasonal new gross registrations than Q1. Based on these and other factors, we now expect full-year 2017 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2.5%, with a change to the domain name base for the second quarter of 2017 of flat to an increase of 0.4 million net registrations. As many of you are aware, we are in a process of renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN, as the current terms ends on June 30. On April 20, ICANN posted the new .net registry agreement for public comment, which is open until May 30. From our perspective, the posted agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as the fees paid to ICANN, the renewal rights or the six-year term. We believe we are on track for renewal prior to the expiration of the current term agreement. Finally, as discussed during our prior earnings call, we decided it was in the best interest of the company to sell our iDefense business. The iDefense sale was completed at the start of the second quarter and VeriSign continues as a customer to benefit from the threat intelligence information provided by iDefense. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $289 million, up 2.4% year-over-year and up 0.8% sequentially. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the first quarter totaled $175 million, up 5.1% from $167 million in the first quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.7%, compared to 59.2% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $116 million compared to $107 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.94 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.82 for the first quarter last year. As of March 31, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $316 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million as compared to $103 million in both the fourth quarter of 2016 and in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily a result of lower marketing spend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 65.1%, compared to 63.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.5 million shares. This compares to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2016 and $0.92 last quarter based on 131.6 million and 125.5 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. For the past two years, we have used a tax rate of 26% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead, we believe a more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 25%. As a result, we will begin to use a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting second quarter 2017 non-GAAP results. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $148 million and free cash flow was $139 million, compared with $150 million and $143 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.3 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter, compared with 21.1 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 20.6 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. With respect to full-year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.145 billion to $1.160 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.138 billion to $1.158 billion range provided on our prior earnings call. Full-year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25%, increased and narrowed from the 64% to 65% range as provided on our last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $93 million and $100 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. And cash taxes for the year are now expected to be between $20 million to $30 million, changed from the $15 million to $25 million range provided on our last call. As previously mentioned, the majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said last quarter, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention, based on current conditions, is to not redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow these cash tax benefits to continue to accrue. The financial guidance provided reflects the completion of our iDefense asset sale on April 1, 2017. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2017. Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. In closing, during the first quarter, we expanded our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus to provide long-term value to our shareholders. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions. And, Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today will come from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions, I want to start with \u2013 I think I saw the gross additions in the quarter were 9.5 million [name registrations]. And if I compare that to pre-uplift from China, that's still pretty good. That's still up from, I want to say, like the high 8.8 million, somewhere in that range. Just wondering what you're seeing as the factors that are helping the gross additions in the quarter? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Sterling. This is George. In short, we saw increased demand from the U.S.-based registrars in the quarter, which was aided, in part, by what we call domain name-centric advertising by several channel partners in and around the Super Bowl, which happened in the February timeframe. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And looking at it, any change in duration of those names? I think you used to talk about maybe kind of 15, 16 month average durations when you average everything together. Is that still the same across the .com and .net base? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yes. That hasn't changed too much over the years. That's still very consistent. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And you mentioned lower marketing spend in the quarter versus the fourth quarter. How should we think about the marketing spend seasonality-wise through the rest of the year, so we could think about the shape of the margins towards the guidance goal? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: You are correct, Sterling. That marketing spend was down sequentially. The reason behind that is partly because Q4 was so high, we had a large amount of marketing spend going into the market in Q4. And then, with regard to our marketing spend this year, the timing of our marketing activities are more heavily weighted toward events later in the year than last year. So, as we've outlined in our 10-Q, our expectation for marketing expense is to increase as a percent of sales in the subsequent quarters. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And very last question, if I could sneak it in, I didn't get a chance to look through, but how much did you actually get? What were the proceeds for iDefense? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: We're not disclosing the sale proceeds from iDefense. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: They were not material. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: I think there might be some more information available in the next quarter since the sale actually closed in Q2, but the sale of iDefense was not a material event. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from Gray Powell with Wells Fargo. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple, if I may. So I might be looking at this wrong, but when I look at the zone files, it looks like domain additions have turned negative so far in April. Your guidance is flat to plus 400,000 [domain additions]. So, I guess, is there anything going on in the first few weeks of the new quarter? Is there any like residual churn from China or just something that I'm potentially missing? Thanks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: I think you're seeing the final sort of move out of the China search names. There were some that carried over into April and we're seeing the final deletions of the so-called China search names from late 2015 and 2016. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then can you give us an update on the international transliterations of .com and .net that you have up and running today? And then just what are your expectations for additional launches over the course of the next year? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: We have three of the transliterations in market, two in Korea and one in Japan. At this point, we don't have any additional details on any additional launches. In China, we are still going through the licensing process to operate our Chinese IDNs, but no additional details to share at this time and we'll provide more information on these and future roll-outs as appropriate. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. And then last one, if I may. Just any update on the .web antitrust investigation? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: No substantive update. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice relative to the CID that we discussed last quarter. Those interactions and dialogues have been constructive. We're producing documents and information and answering their questions as needed. So it's an ongoing process. Nothing substantive to update now. But, of course, as soon as there is, we'll share it with you. Gray W. Powell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. David Atchley, at this time, I'll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And again, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.05 and $171 million in free cash flow. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150.5 million. Our financial position is strong, with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.3 million, consisting of 129.2 million names for .com and 15.1 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 0.68 million net names during the second quarter after processing 9.2 million new gross registrations. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017 will be 73.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2016. We are updating the full year 2017 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 2.75%. Also, we expect the domain name base to increase during the third quarter between 0.8 million to 1.3 million registrations. I'll comment now on a few recent events. In June, the .net registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN was successfully renewed. The new agreement does not contain changes to the material terms such as pricing terms, renewal rights, the six-year term, or fees paid to ICANN. Also in June, we issued $550 million of senior unsecured notes with a 4.75% coupon maturing in 10 years. This offering closed in early July and we're pleased with the results of this issuance. Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration, as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2018, the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration will increase from $8.20 to $9.02. We believe this positions .net competitively in the marketplace while keeping .net priced lower than other popular legacy TLDs. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $289 million, up 0.7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the second quarter totaled $175 million, compared with $176 million in the second quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 60.6% compared to 61.5% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $123 million compared to $113 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.99 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.87 for the second quarter last year. (5:42) the second quarter include a pre-tax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.09. As Jim mentioned earlier, the company continues to manage its capital structure. Earlier this month we took advantage of what we felt were favorable market conditions and added another long-term fixed-rate piece of debt into our capital structure. The 10-year note issuance, which totaled $550 million, is scheduled to mature on July 15, 2027, and carried an interest rate of 4.75%. As this offering closed in early July, our second quarter ending balance sheet does not reflect the net proceeds from this issuance. As of June 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $269 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million, as compared to $99 million in the same quarter a year ago and $101 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.3% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $130 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.05 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124 million shares. This compares to $0.91 in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.96 last quarter, based on 130.6 million and 124.5 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. Results for the second quarter included pre-tax gain of $10.6 million on the sale of the iDefense business, which increased non-GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.06. As noted in our last earnings call, beginning with the second quarter financials, we are now using a 25% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting non-GAAP results. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $181 million and free cash flow was $171 million, compared with $167 million and $161 million respectively for the second quarter last year. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 22.5 million shares, based on average share price during the second quarter, compared with 21.9 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 21.3 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.145 billion to $1.160 billion range provided on our prior earnings call. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% to 65.25%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million, as compared with the $93 million to $100 million range provided on our last call, reflecting the additional senior note interest expense from the recent issuance. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million, changed from the $35 million to $45 million range provided on our last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures as they become redeemable in August of this year, which will allow the tax benefits to continue to accrue. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2017. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. In closing, during the second quarter we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We have marked some significant milestones since our last call. In addition to renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN for another six years, earlier this month the company surpassed 20 continuous years of 100% availability in the .com and .net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. We believe our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trendlines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you We'll go first to Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks. This is Matt Lemenager on for Rob. Question on the strength of the domain name activity, quarter to date, in the guidance, it's a little bit above maybe what we expected, at least a few quarters ago, at 0.8 million to 1.3 million. So as we think about what is driving that strength, is there any direction that you can point to us? Is it perhaps promotional activity, or international domain name ads? I don't know if there's any color you could add there. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: I think probably the biggest contributors there are, there is some strengthening in the economy. There's more economic activity, which generally contributes to domain name growth. But I also think the strong brands that .com and .net represent, they're strong, recognized, trusted global brands, are showing their strength and contributed to that good performance as well. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: The only other point I'd put on that, Rob, is as you saw in the first quarter, we had also good demand coming out of the U.S. market, and that strength in the U.S. continued into the second quarter. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, thanks. And then just one other question on the expense structure. Is there any expenses that are kind of more second half weighted? As we think about the EBIT margin guidance we've kind of been above, or at the high end of that range for the full-year guide. Is there anything for the second half, that's maybe expenses that are second-half-specific, that would cause that EBIT margin to come in at that lower end of that guide? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, we provided our guidance for our non-GAAP operating margin for the full year just now, but as far as how expenses flow, what we've outlined in our 10-Q is we do expense our sales and marketing expenses to be higher in the second half of the year, but we'll continue to manage all the expenses of the business, and we expect to be within the non-GAAP operating margin of between 64.5% to 64.25% just given earlier. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : And we'll go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Hey. Hi guys, this is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. Just to expand on the domain name question, you said about the strengthening economy in the U.S. that is driving the growth in domains. What are you seeing within the international market currently, versus what you saw about a year ago? And how should we think about it going forward? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, there's a \u2013 let me see if I understand your question properly. By international markets, I can point to one thing that has changed. We did mention in several past quarters that the so-called China surge, which began in late 2015 and continued into 2016, including the second quarter, of course, affected renewals through 2017. We believe now that, that effect, the China effect, so to speak, has pretty much pushed through the system. So I think that might be a factor. Certainly, some activity I would point to in terms of international market. There is general strong growth in the international market. But as George pointed out, some growth in the U.S. market in the first quarter continued into the second market as well. So there are good signs, there's general growth outside the U.S. and then economic activity in the U.S. has contributed to some continuing growth here. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Perfect. That's really helpful. And another one on expenses. Operating margins came somewhere around 65.3% versus somewhere 66% we were estimating. Any particular expenses that were higher within the quarter that led to the dinging of margins? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: So we did see a slight increase in G&A expense in the quarter. During the quarter we purchased some additional software licenses for the core business, and we also had slightly higher legal fees in the quarter. But again, on a non-GAAP basis, we were pretty much flat. We can consistently be around about $100 million non-GAAP operating expense level. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Okay. And if I could sneak one more in, where are you currently in the .web antitrust suit, and what is a normal procedure and timeline you're expecting with that particular suit? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, there's really no update to provide on .web at this point. With respect to our interactions with the Department of Justice, we continue to cooperate with DOJ as it pertains to the CID we discussed last quarter. That dialogue is constructive, has been constructive. We produced documents and information. We'd answered questions as needed, and we're meeting with the department. So that's an ongoing process, and beyond that, there's really nothing to say at this point. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Perfect. Thank you so much guys. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. Just I guess to start off, a follow-up on one of those last questions. I was wondering if you might be able to, George, put a finer point on the amount of excess G&A expense in Q2, just for us to get a little bit more of a normalized sense of the OpEx. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, I'm not sure what you mean by excess expense, Greg. I mean, we continue to manage all the lines of expenses throughout the business pretty much on a quarterly and monthly basis. And each quarter, there's always going to be some type of expense that comes in that might not have been planned or one might call non-recurring. But I think if you continue to call those out, any expense you could almost view as non-recurring. As I said, in the quarter we did purchase some additional software licenses in the quarter, and we did have some higher legal costs in the quarter, But we will have, from time to time, the need to purchase additional software licenses in the business, and we'll have the need to spend additional money from a legal perspective for the company. And so again, I'd look back at the big picture. On a non-GAAP basis, total expense was a little over $100 million, $100.7 million. And compared to last quarter, which was a similar amount, and year-over-year, I believe it was $99 million a year ago quarter versus $100 million there. We did have a little bit higher stock-based compensation in the quarter on a GAAP basis, and that's really a function of two areas. One, since last year, we have brought on some additional senior management to the company, in particular, if you looked at our website, we brought on an SVP of Product. And then we also, as a senior management team, do have some longer-term incentive programs, and as we continue to execute on our plan and deliver on the results over and above some of the goals that were set, we do have some accelerators that get accrue there as we continue to execute. So we'll continue to try to do that. But again, from a GAAP perspective, we had a little bit more stock-based compensation. And as I said, we had a few other nits and that in the quarter. But in general, very consistent with the year-ago period as well as sequentially. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, just one other question. As you noted in your prepared remarks, you recently issued a little over $500 million in debt. Are you looking to put that to work in relatively short order, or can you give us an update on what you plan to do with the cash? Thanks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. So as you point out, we absolutely added some additional debt to capital structure. And as you know, as a company, we try to actively manage that capital structure. One of the things that we clearly look at and monitor is our ability to raise debt in the market, our ability to execute it, and also what interest rate we can do that. And when we looked at the market, we felt that where the market was, it was an attractive time for us to go add other piece of long-term capital to our capital structure. So as far as use of proceeds, as we mentioned in the offering, we plan to use those proceeds for general corporate purposes. That would also include potential share repurchases. As you know from following us, we don't guide to share repurchases, but we try to be very prudent with the capital of the company and we'll continue to look for ways to generate positive returns for the shareholders. Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : And with that, I'd like to turn the conference back over to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Again, that does concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation.",

James Bidzos - Executive Chairman, President and CEO Todd Strubbe - Executive Vice President and COO George Kilguss - Executive Vice President and CFO Analysts : Matt Lemenager - Baird Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded, and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations section of our verisign.com website. There, you will also find our third quarter 2017 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically, the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year, and delivered strong financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1 and $153 million in free cash flow. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.5 million shares for $147 million. Our financial position is strong, with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 145.8 million, consisting of 130.8 million names for .com and 15 million names for .net. The domain name base increased by 1.47 million net names during the third quarter after processing 8.9 million new gross registrations. Gross additions during the quarter benefited from continued strength from US based registrars. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2017 will be 74.3%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.0% achieved in the third quarter of 2016. We expected increase to the domain name base during the fourth quarter of between 0.4 million to 0.9 million registrations, which is consistent with the full year 2017 domain name base growth rate of 2.8% to 3.1%. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thank you, Jim. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $292 million, up 1.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the United States and 41% was from foreign customers. As it relates to our GAAP results, operating income in the third quarter totaled $181 million, compared with $175 million in the third quarter of 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 61.9% compared to 60.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $115 million compared to $114 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.90 for the third quarter last year. As of September 30, 2017, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $757 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2017 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense, which excludes $14 million in stock-based compensation totaled $97 million, as compared to $100 million both last quarter and the same quarter a year ago. While non-GAAP operating expenses were lower in the second quarter, we do expect an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 66.7% compared to 65.3% in the same quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $124 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.1 million shares. This compares to $0.93 in the third quarter of 2016 and $1.05 last quarter, based on 127.7 million and 124.0 million weighted average diluted shares respectively. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $175 million and free cash flow was $153 million, compared with $171 million and $165 million respectively for the third quarter last year. Free cash flow in the third quarter was lower, partially due to a timing some capital expenditures. Dilution related to convertible debentures was 24 million shares, based on average share price during the third quarter, compared with 20.8 million for the same quarter of 2016 and 22.5 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of second quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.5 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. With respect to full year 2017 guidance, revenue for 2017 is now expected to be in the range of $1.161 billion to $1.166 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.155 billion to $1.165 billion range provided on our prior earnings call. Full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 65% and 65.5% increased and now from the 64.5% to 65.25% range provided on our prior earnings call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $103 million and $110 million. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $45 million and $55 million, changed from the $40 million to $50 million range provided on the last call. And cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $20 million and $30 million. The majority of expected cash taxes in 2017 are foreign, primarily because of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. As we said in prior calls, these convertible debentures are an important part of our capital structure, and our intention based on current conditions is not to redeem these debentures, which will allow the cash tax benefits to continue to accrue. In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2017. Now, I will turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. In closing, during the third quarter we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We think our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions. So operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to Rob Oliver, Baird. Matt Lemenager : Hi. Thanks, guys. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob this afternoon. Can you give us any update on the web civil investigative demand? I think we talked about a couple of quarters ago, is there any update on that process or how that's setting [ph]? James Bidzos : The update is really the same, there's no new news, although there is activity, the process is ongoing. We are continuing to cooperate with the Justice Department regarding the CID that you asked about. There's an ongoing constructive dialogue. We're producing documents and information. But beyond that there's nothing new to say at this point. Of course, as soon as there is we'll let you know. Matt Lemenager : Got it. And my next question is just, do you have any thought on - I think about speculators or squatters, as we think about the arising with things like bitcoin and the theorem and things like that. Is there any - have you guys seen the impact of people who maybe before would have been coming and buying domain. Just curious to get your thoughts on kind of the impact of bitcoin and other things like that that people may be out purchasing? James Bidzos : I don't know of any direct relationship between people purchasing bitcoin and domain names. I can tell you that we do - we do report on trends in domain name registration and bitcoin trends frequently, consistently and often. So people are registering names related to bitcoin and cryptocurrency and those types of things. So we do see those, and we do report those registration trends. Beyond that, I don't think there's any unusual activity that we have to report. Matt Lemenager : Got it. Thanks, guys. I'll jump back in queue. James Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Mr. Atchley, I'll turn things over to you for any final comments. David Atchley : Great. Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you all for joining us.",

Jim Bidzos : Thanks David and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter which kept the strong 2017 for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long term value to our shareholders.  In 2017 VeriSign delivered strong financial performance reporting $1.165 billion in revenues, resulting in $653 million in free cash flow and generating full year 2017 non-GAAP operating margins of 65.3%. 2017 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base, in which the company processed 36.7 million registrations and finished the with 146.4 million links. During the year we marked more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. Also last year we renewed the .net registry agreement for another 6 years until 2023.  During the quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.3 million for $145 million. during the full year 2017, we repurchased 6.3 million shares for $593 million. Effective today the board of directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $586 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program which have no expression.  Our final position in strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $146.4 million, consisting of 131.9 million names for .com and 14.5 million names for .net. During the fourth quarter we processed 9 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 0.57 million names. During the quarter we continue to see strength from domestic registrars which was offset by a lower second time renewal rate associated with the remaining China surge names from late 2015. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be 72.2%. We expect full year 2018 domain name base growth guidance to be between 2% and 3%. For the first quarter we expect an increase to the domain name base of between 1.5 million to 2 million registrations. I would like to comment now on a recent positive development in our efforts to become the registry operator for .web. You may have seen the 8K we filed in January, in it we disclosed that the U.S. Department of Justice's anti-trust division notified us that it had closed its investigation regarding the .web top level domain. We're now engaged in ICANN process to move the delegation of .web forward. However as this is ICANN's process we cannot say when it will conclude and while it's possible that our operation of .web will commence this year the 2018 revenue guidance we will provide does not include any revenue from .web. Of course, we will provide with updates as appropriate. And now I would like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2107 the company generated revenue of 1.165 million up 2% from 2016 and delivered GAAP operating income of 708 million up 3% from 687 million for the full year 2016. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $296 million, up 3.2% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially.  During the quarter, 60% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 40% was from customer abroad. As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $176 million compared with $169 million in fourth quarter 2016. The operating margin in the quarter came to 59.7% compared to 59% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $103 million compared to $106 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $0.83 in the fourth quarter of this year compared to $0.84 for the fourth quarter last year. As of December 31, 2017, the company maintained total asset of 2.9 billion and total liabilities of 4.2 billion. Assets included 2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalence and marketable securities of which 729 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad.  I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. And then we'll discuss our 2018 full year guidance.  As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation totaled $106 million compared to $97 million last quarter and $103 million in the same quarter a year ago.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher in the fourth quarter as we had indicated on our last call primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 64.1% compared to 63.9% in the same quarter of 2016.  Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $119 million resulting in a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.96 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 124.3 million shares. This compares to the $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $1 last quarter based on $125.5 million and $124.1 million weighted average diluted shares respectively.  Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 25.2 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with $20.6 million for the same quarter in 2016 and 24 million shares last quarter.  The share count was reduced by the full effect of third quarter 2017 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the $1.3 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $199 million and free cash flow was $190 million compared with $205 million and $198 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year.  Now, I'd like to provide an update on implications to the company of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, which I'll refer to as the Tax Act. As stated in today's earnings release, fourth quarter and full year 2017 GAAP financial results include a net $9 million tax expense increase resulting from the Tax Act. This increase is comprised of a provisional income tax expense of $196 million consisting of onetime U.S. taxes on cumulative foreign earnings triggered by the Tax Act and related for withholding taxes. Both net of applying previously unrecognized foreign tax credits. This expense is offset by an income tax benefit of $187 million resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities from 35% to the 21% U.S. federal income tax rate in the Tax Act.  As a result of the onetime U.S. taxes on cumulative foreign earnings we also intend to repatriate by early in the second quarter of 2018 approximately $1.1 billion of cash held by foreign subsidiaries net of foreign withholding taxes based on current exchange rates.  Additionally, on a go-forward basis due to the Tax Act, annual earnings of our foreign subsidiaries will be taxed by the U.S. This allows for annual repatriation without further U.S. taxation of distributable capital reserves from foreign entities. The taxation of foreign earnings and withholding taxes associated with ongoing repatriations will increase cash taxes over the amount the company has historically paid.  Also, the lower corporate tax rates and limitations on the deductibility of interest implemented by the Tax Act, decreases the value of future interest expense deductions. In light of the Tax Act, we're presently evaluating our capital structure including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures.  Finally, since mid-2017, we've used a tax rate of 25% to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share. Looking ahead we believe the more reasonable estimate of the tax rate to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. As a result, we will begin to use 22% non-GAAP tax rate when reporting first quarter 2018 non-GAAP results.  With respect to full year 2018 guidance, revenue is expected to be in the range of 1,195 million to 1,215 million. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $115 million and $122 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million, and finally cash taxes are expected to be between $70 million and $90 million. This 2018 cash tax guidance reflects our best estimate of the various impacts of the Tax Act including the impacts of our intended repay reaction.  In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year 2017. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. 2017 was another solid year for VeriSign, there was further expansion of the domain name based and revenues, we generated an efficiently return value to shareholders, we renewed the .net registry agreement for another six years until 2023 and we mark more than 20 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net.  Finally, or early with this year we discuss that the U.S. Department of Justice notified as closed it investigation regarding the .net top level domain. We continued our work to protect grow advance of business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We think our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution in extent the long-term lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Gregg Moskowitz : In the third quarter the top five keyword searches for .com and while some form of crypto currency and black chain, how incremental do you think crypto has been in driving .com growth as over the past several months or so. Jim Bidzos : I don\u2019t think I have it at the tip of my fingers that pr\u00e9cis numbers but I don\u2019t believe that they are materially, I've seen a lot of activity in the secondary markets of trading in comp registrations that have crypto in them. But I don\u2019t think that there are any meaningful direct contributions to new net registrations in the numbers that we've reported.  There is just a huge amount of interest in cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin as you know now that it has the exchanges. And what we've seen I would say specifically is a spike in value in the secondary market of -- any multiple keyword names with crypto in them. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay, thanks Jim. And then George, you have told us that you would spend more in marketing Q4 and did and then I know I'm dating myself here, but I would have to go all the way back to 2007 to find another quarter where sales and marketing expense grew this much in absolute dollars on a sequential basis. So, can you maybe just sort of give a little bit more color on the activities that you undertook in Q4 as well as what the sales and marketing strategy is for 2018? George Kilguss : Sure. I mean keep in mind though on an annual basis, our total marketing expense is pretty flat year-over-year. As I talked about few quarters ago, we clearly look to execute on marketing programs, that we think drive the best returns for the company and sometimes those programs we have to pivot during the year and we had lighter marketing expenses as we've talked about in the middle of 2017 and we finally got some programs coming out. We didn't make a little bit of a shift away from some register our marketing programs to more direct marketing programs. We did some advertising for our brands both .com and .net both domestically and abroad. And so, we've been doing a little bit more direct marketing as a result of that. And those programs came out in the fourth quarter and will continue to run in the first half of 2018 here. Gregg Moskowitz : Okay, great. And then just one last question for me. Can you expand on why your cash taxes are so much higher in 2018? And as part of that is the [indiscernible] tax yield associated with the convert? Is that less valuable going forward under tax reform? George Kilguss : Yes. So as mentioned in my prepared remarks, from a GAAP perspective, we made an accrual for the onetime transition tax and that was partially offset by the revaluation of our DTLs and from a GAAP perspective that was about $9 million.  From a cash tax perspective, as you mentioned we're guiding to $70 million to $90 million in 2018 and that's up from about $28 million this year. As mentioned this reflects a variety of the impacts from the Tax Act including the impacts of our impended repatriation. And while I don't think it make sense with all the puts and takes with the tax calculation, I think the big items impacting the company from a cash tax perspective going forward are really the tax on foreign earnings, the U.S. tax on foreign earnings and then the U.S. limitations on interest deductions partially offset by the U.S. tax rate but that amount does include impact as well from our repatriation.  As far as interest limitations U.S. tax reforms clearly has diminished benefits for interest expense, there are some limitations there. And as a result, I mentioned we are looking at our entire capital structure, we're looking at it, we'll be evaluating it. And as our convert to part of that capital structure we'll look at them as well. Operator : We'll go next to Rob Oliver with Baird. Matt Lemenager : Good afternoon this is Matt -- in for Rob. I realize I might be early, but just looking to see if there is any plan around .web? Maybe things around go-to-market, how that might look, any different than .com would you be doing extra marketing just to get that brand up and going. Any early thoughts I realize, no expectation in the guidance or anything but any early thoughts. Jim Bidzos : I think it's just too early at this point to discuss any details about go-to-market or launch plan for .web. because an ICANN process that we are now engaged in with Department of Justice having closed their investigation of .web and when that process completes, I'm sure we will have a lot more to say but at this point would just be premature. Matt Lemenager : And on the expectations for domain growth 2% to 3% for this year, any difference in the expectations for U.S. versus international, I know you talked about strength in the economy in the United States and that the China phenomenon has kind roll of, I don\u2019t know if any of the international markets were starting to come back. George Kilguss : In 2017 we absolutely have seen a good U.S. market but have been said that European markets have also done well for us, our expectation is that we will see good growth in both U.S. and international markets next year but we don\u2019t guide to the specific markets over their performances. Matt Lemenager : Got it and the last question I had, on the repatriation. Would it be fair to assume that the primary use case would be for share repurchases or do you think there would be other avenues that you would look to deploy the repatriated cash? George Kilguss : Well, I think in general, I don\u2019t think there will be a change in how we approach capital allocation. As always, we look to need to business using our strategic frame work of protect, grow and manage and we do what we think is best for the business. As you may recall our strategic frame work includes making sure we maintain and adequate amount of liquidity for the business both today and for tomorrow, what we think the needs are to continue to invest in our protect mission for the network and our business for today and tomorrow, to invest in technology and innovation that we think will drive profitable growth for the business and then once we accomplish those goals, we then evaluate how much excess capital we think appropriate to return to shareholders and in what form. We think that frame work which we have been using for the past six years as service well and we will continue to use that frame work as it relates to the capital corporation. Operator : We will go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Ugam Kamat : This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. So, Jim, you mentioned that the renewal rate out of China was disappointing, especially the second-time renewal rate. So just wondering what was the renewal rate especially in China? Like you gave the blended renewal rate, but just wondering, what was the renewal rate in China? And how many names are left? And what would be the future renewal rates that you expect to come out from this region? George Kilguss : We don\u2019t guide renewal rates by country as mentioned the cohort that was originally from the 2015 China search that cohort was about 1.4 million names coming into the year and that renewal rate was probably out of blended basis may be about 40%, for that cohort. So, we did have a portion of those names come out, however we were anticipating that, we did comment on that last quarter and that was in the guidance that we gave and we fell within the range of the guidance but most of that cohort now is I would say through the system if many material names. I would expect renewal rates to go back to more normalized rates. Ugam Kamat : All right, perfect. That's helpful. And secondly, since we are coming closer to the Cooperative Agreement date in October, any particular update that you can give us on the process that you're having with the Department of Commerce? Or any particular survey that they might have done to allow the renewal of Cooperative Agreement or just allow it to expire? Jim Bidzos : Well, first of all, I guess just to remind everybody on the call. In late September 2016, NTIA approved the .com registry agreement to be extended to November 30, 2024. At that time, NTIA chose not to extend the cooperative agreement. So, it is currently scheduled to terminate on November 30, 2018. Whether to extend that cooperative agreement or not as NTIA's decision and their process. And so, I can't comment on that. they have the right to conduct the public interest review for the sole purpose of terminating whether or not they will exercise their right to extend the term of the cooperative agreement.  Now one update that is new since the last time we've talked is that David Redl was confirmed as the assistant secretary and administrator of the NTIA in that November of 2017. Unfortunately, there is no update I can give you there, we can't comment on Mr. Redl's appointment or the NTIA in regard to their progress related to the cooperative agreement that's theirs not ours. As soon as we can, we'll share whatever information we do have though. Operator : we'll take our last question from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Walter Pritchard : Hi thank. I think all my questions have been answered. Just one I wanted to make sure I clarified. On the tax scenario that you've outlined the $70 million to $90 million in the tax reform out of 22%. Does that contemplate within in the convert. And if not does the redeem of the convert potentially have additional tax impact beyond what you've talked about. George Kilguss : So, Walter as I mentioned, we're just evaluating our convertible debentures in conjunction with evaluating our capital structure. So, we're still looking at that. So, our guidance is really based on where we see today or what we're doing it, it's doesn't involve looking at any changes from that fact. We're still evaluating it. Walter Pritchard : And then is that 70 to 90 cash tax rate, it sounds like that doesn't mean, most companies are talking about having an 8 year [Technical Difficulty]. George Kilguss : Yeah so, I think you're referring to the transition tax, Tax Act allows you to look at your taxes and what they would have been with the Tax Act or without. So, it's a with or without calculation. And for us when we do that calculation, we expect to actually defer that amount of tax over the 8 years allowed by the Tax Act. Walter Pritchard : Okay. So, the 70 to 90 will that be a pretty good number of the next say several years. That include that 8-year period too? George Kilguss : So, as we mentioned previously, we don't guide to a long-term cash tax rate. However, I would say in the short term we expect that that rate to still be below our GAAP tax rate as we use up foreign tax credits. At the end of 2017 we had about $122 million of foreign tax credits. And we now expect to utilize those over the next 2 to 3 years. Walter Pritchard : But the 70 to 90 does includes still the benefit of some of those foreign tax credits and then those would expire at some point here. George Kilguss : That\u2019s correct. Walter Pritchard : Okay, any good detail on how much per year you can use of that 122? George Kilguss : Like I said they will probably full utilize it over the next three years, so obviously you\u2019re using more up in the year one and two and probably less in year three but the utilization of FTC to be perfectly candid is somewhat complex and is depended on a variety of factors, so it\u2019s a little bit, clearly I have an idea of what they will be but it's probably premature to give that number because they can change overtime depending on how foreign income is recognized overseas. Operator : And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Again, this does conclude today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our first quarter 2018 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation, as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance, including non-GAAP EPS of $1.07, up 11% year-over-year. During the first quarter, we completed the repatriation of a net $1.15 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries which we intend to use in conjunction with the redemption of our convertible debentures, as George will discuss later. Also, we paused our repurchase activities during the 30-day conversion measurement period for our pending May 1 convertible bond redemption. As a result, we returned $125 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 1.1 million shares in the first quarter. Our financial position remained strong with $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 148.3 million, consisting of 133.9 million names for .com and 14.4 million names for .net. During the first quarter, we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.91 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.5% achieved in the first quarter of 2017. We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 2.5% and 3.25%, with an increase to the domain name base for the second quarter of 2018 of between 0.7 million to 1.2 million net registrations. I also want to report that we are engaged in a dialogue with NTIA concerning the cooperative agreement which is ongoing, but beyond that we don't have more to say at this time. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $299 million, up 3.7% year-over-year and up by 1.3% sequentially. During the quarter, 59% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from foreign customers. As it relates to first quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $185 million compared with $175 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 62% compared to 60.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $134 million compared to $116 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.09 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.94 for the first quarter last year. As of March 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $2.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion. Assets included $2.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $1.8 billion were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which will include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss the redemption of our convertible debentures and provide updates on our 2018 full year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $101 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $101 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 66.3% compared to 65.1% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $132 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.07 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.5 million shares, this compares to $0.96 in both the first quarter of 2017 and last quarter. As noted in our last call, as a result of the Tax Act and beginning with this quarter's results, the tax rate used to calculate our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share is 22%. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $90 million and free cash flow was $82 million compared with $148 million and $139 million respectively for the first quarter last year. First quarter 2018 cash flow reflects approximately $61 million in withholding taxes paid in connection with the net $1.15 billion repatriation. As mentioned last quarter, in light of the Tax Act, we were evaluating our capital structure, including the possible redemption of our convertible debentures. You may have seen that on February 15, the company issued a redemption notice for all the outstanding convertible debentures. This redemption settles next week on May 1, and the company has sufficient domestic liquidity to settle the redemption. If holders elect to convert their debentures, the company intends to settle the $1.25 billion principal value in cash, and the excess value will be settled in shares of the company's stock. The actual number of shares issued for holders who elect to convert is determined based on an observation period that ran from March 15, 2018, through today. While the calculation is not yet finalized, approximately 26.1 million shares would be issued if all convertible debenture holders elect to convert. For a comparison, 25.6 million shares of dilution related to the convertible debentures was used in calculating our fully diluted shares in our first quarter results, which was based on the average share price during the first quarter. The accounting for the settlement of the debentures will occur during the second quarter. Historically, the convertible debentures were an important part of the company's capital structure. With U.S. tax reform implemented at the end of last year, many of the tax benefits generated by the convertible debentures were limited. Over time, this instrument became more equity-like in the company's capital structure, and with the diminished tax benefits post-tax reform, we decided to redeem the convertible debentures. Now, I'd like to provide you some updates to our full year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.215 billion now from the $1.195 billion to $1.215 billion provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 65.5% and 66.5%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $85 million and $92 million, decreased from the $115 million and $122 million range provided on our last call. The $30 million decrease in the range is primarily due to the redemption of our convertible notes. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $75 million to $95 million, change from the $70 million to $90 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. Overall, this has been another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We think our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line, and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner. We'll now take your questions. And operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we will take our first question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to start with Jim, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a discussion now going on with the NTIA regarding the cooperative agreement. Just want to make sure we level set. So, does that mean that between now and November 30, this should come to a conclusion in terms of whether they extend the cooperative agreement or let it sunset? And is there any chance that we could see an announcement prior to that November 30th date? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Let's see. Well, first of all, you're correct that NTIA may decide to extend the cooperative agreement as is or let it sunset. Additionally, VeriSign and NTIA could mutually agree to amend it per the terms of Amendment 34 of the cooperative agreement. As far as what you might see between now and then, I think this early \u2013 I mean, we're engaged, but I think it's too early to say what milestones, when and what they would look like. It's just really too early to say anything more than we did unfortunately. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And just a follow-up to that. When the announcement came that they would look at the cooperative agreement before November \u2013 or at the November 30th timeline, I think there were some discussion of a public interest study, has that come up in your discussions or is there anything that's been made public around that part in the process? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. As I said, it's just \u2013 we're engaged. I don't think it'd be appropriate for me to say anything about what's come up in the discussions that we're having, but they're are ongoing. And all I can tell you is that we'll certainly keep you posted, and if there are any milestones or anything to report, we'll do it promptly. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Sounds good. And then one question on the business, looking at the domestic/international split, we went through that timeframe with the Chinese names. But I'm really curious, when you look at the international sourced growth in particular, what are you seeing in terms of where the areas of biggest growth at the moment and how do you think about the sustainability of it? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Sterling, this is George. I mean, when we talk about growth, we do think the drivers of domain name growth continue to be internet adoption, internet penetration, and continued growth of e-commerce. So, we think that those worldwide metrics bode well for our business. Where growth comes from quarter to quarter does vary. This quarter, in the first quarter, we saw good growth out of the U.S., out of China, and continued results out of our European registrars, registrars in all those areas seem to be performing well for us. Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Matthew Wells with Citi. Please go ahead. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, Jim. This is Matt with Citi. I wanted to ask if you had any update on .web? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Nothing. Nothing since we last spoke. And for those who weren't here or aren't familiar with what the status is, we're engaged in ICANN's process to move the delegation forward for .web. That's ICANN's process, so we can't say when it'll conclude. Just as a reminder too for all of you looking at the guidance of course, while it's possible that our operation of .web will start this year, we did not include, the 2018 revenue guidance provided does not include any revenue from .web, and we'll give you more updates as available, but unfortunately that's all I can give you now. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks on that. And I have one more question. Has .web and that purchase come up with your discussions with the NTIA at all? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: No. Our discussions with NTIA are about the cooperative agreement, .web we view separately. And the Department of Justice, of course, closed its open investigation of .web. So, it has not come up. We wouldn't expect it to. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Yes. That's helpful. Operator : And we will take our last question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good afternoon. Thanks. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob. I've a question on the renewal rate, 74.9% this quarter is a bit higher than it's been trending. And I know we're kind of churning through the China names and things like that, and the renewal rate might be expected to go up. But was there anything that drove the 74.9% renewal rate? Because that ticked up from the highest metric at least in recent years. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. Matt, thanks. As you point out, our preliminary renewal rate of 74.9% was a good renewal rate for us, but I think as you also alluded to, when you compare that to our Q1 2017 renewal rate of 72.5%, the change there is really primarily related to a depressed Q1 2017 rate that was negatively impacted by the China surge names that were registered in the first quarter of 2016 that did not renew in the first quarter of 2017. And while 2017 was still up year-over-year when I exclude those impacts from 2017, it is still really consistent with our normal expectations of a slightly rising renewal rate associated with an aging domain name base. So, I don't think there's anything unusual to call out there, other than the base continues to age, and as a result, renewal rates tend to pick up a slight amount as the previous renewed names become a large proportion of the overall base. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And just given the cash repatriation, just a question I guess on capital allocation, capital structure, and then we paused the buyback this quarter a little bit. Are there any plans to step up the buyback going forward just given the new allocation structure? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Matt, as in the past, we don't guide to buybacks. We have an active capital allocation process that we look at every quarter, and we try to meet the needs of the business every quarter, and we determine through our strategic framework, protect, grow and manage how much liquidity we need to have for the business, what do we need to invest in the business, what do we need to, and then what we have to return to shareholders. So, we look at that every quarter and make a determination, but we do not provide guidance with regard to buybacks. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our last question will be a follow-up question from Matthew Wells with Citi. Please go ahead. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, Jim. This question is along the same thread that was just asked. But when you're looking at your framework for capital allocation, does the redemption of the debt and changes to the tax law change, how you look at repurchases versus potentially issuing a dividend? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Go ahead, George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. I would say, look, whether it was post-tax reform or post-redemption of our convertible debenture, I really don't expect our capital structure or capital allocation philosophy to change. Again, we constantly review the needs of the business and we're really trying to make decisions that are in the best interest of the business. So, we clearly look at the best way to return that capital to shareholders. Historically, we felt that the share repurchases have been in the best interest of the shareholders. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we're not quite complete yet with the redemption of the bond. That process will be complete soon. We did make a repatriation of the $1.15 billion, and obviously, that will look different going forward. I think we're still really evaluating all the long-term significance of the tax law. I think the one thing I can assure you of is that, our priority of course is protect, grow and manage. And in the manage category, when it comes to making sure that we return generated value to shareholders, we're going to do that in the most efficient way possible. The philosophy that drives that hasn't changed a bit. I think you're asking a more tactical question as to whether or not some rethinking would lead to some analysis that says a dividend or some shift in or difference or reallocation of buybacks to dividends. And we don't guide to that as George said, but I think that's sort of a tactical question that our ongoing analysis would yield, and if something there changes, we would certainly share it when appropriate. But fundamentally, nothing has really changed. We're just looking at a very dynamic situation, where the tax law gives us opportunities, and we're still assessing them and looking for what's in the best long-term interest of our shareholders in terms of capital structure and capital allocation relative to our strategy of efficiently returning generated value, that hasn't changed a bit. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That color was really helpful. Appreciate your time. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, once again, this concludes today's call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded and unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Ashley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's second quarter 2018 earnings call.

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterwards we will open the call for your questions. With that I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year, and delivered solid financial performance including non-GAAP EPS of $1.18, up 12% year-over-year. During the second quarter we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares for $125 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 149.7 million, consisting of 135.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net. During the second quarter we processed 9.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.4 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2018 will be 74.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.0% achieved in the second quarter of 2017. We now expect full year 2018 domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4.25% with an increase to the domain name base for the third quarter of 2018 of between 1.3 million and 1.8 million net registrations. To update you on our discussions about the Cooperative Agreement, VeriSign and NTIA are engaged in dialogue about amending the Cooperative Agreement and what that amendment would look like. But beyond that we don't have anything else to say at this time. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $302 million, up 4.8% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. The increase was primarily a result of improved new domain name registrations and improving renewal rates over the prior year. Operating income for the period totaled $193 million compared with $175 million in the second quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 60.6% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $128 million compared to $123 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.04 in the second quarter of this year compared to $0.99 for the same quarter of last year. As of June 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $569 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $96 million compared to $101 million last quarter and $100 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 68.2%, compared to 66.3% last quarter and 65.3% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $145 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.18 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 123.2 million shares. This compares to $1.07 last quarter and $1.05 in the second quarter of 2017. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $202 million and free cash flow was $191 million compared with $181 million and $171 million respectively for the second quarter last year. Now we would like to provide updates to our full-year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.205 billion to $1.215 billion, narrowed from the $1.2 billion to $1.215 billion provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 66% and 67%, increased from the 65.5% to 66.5% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $82 million and $89 million, decreased from the $85 million and $92 million range provided on our last call. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, narrowed from the $75 million to $95 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. Second quarter was a solid one for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues were generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We continue to work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. Last week the company surpassed 21 continuous years of 100% availability in the common net DNS. This record is the result of the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead. Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my question. And I know, Jim, that you said you won't comment on the CA. But I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. On the time line it's a November expiration so is it likely we would get some resolution on this before kind of our next earnings call? Or is it something that we would be unlikely to hear about until the actual expiration? And then I just had a quick follow-up. Thank you. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah, Rob. Nice try. Sorry, we're engaged in a dialogue with NTIA and really can't speculate on the time line. It's their process. Rob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thanks, Jim. And then I just wanted to ask about just kind of where we are with .web and any color that you guys can provide around how that ramp might begin to look. Thank you guys very much. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure, thanks. Well, we're engaged in ICANN's process on .web to move the delegation forward but this is ICANN's process so we can't say exactly when it will conclude. We'll certainly give you updates when they're available. Operator, another one? Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Hey. Hi guys, this is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So just to hit on the Cooperative Agreement, Jim, you mentioned about that you are amending the agreement with ICANN? Just so that we are clear on that one, is it ruled out about the possibility of renewing or the contract throwing away and the third possibility of amending is the one that you are taking moving forward? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, that is the statement that we made. Those others were certainly in a range of possibility. I suppose anything is possible. But the facts as they sit today that I can say speaking for both VeriSign and NTIA is precisely the statement that I made earlier, which is that we are engaged in a dialogue about amending the Cooperative Agreement and what that amendment would look like. And I guess I would just add that amendments are certainly possible by mutual agreement between NTIA and VeriSign. So again we're engaged and that's the process we're in currently. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Great. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Since that process is still ongoing I can't speculate on what's possible at the end of it. But that's the statement I'm providing today. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Great. I mean, that's helpful. And one on the like net additions for the total domain names, you are guiding to something like 4% at the midpoint. I mean, that's the best rates that we have seen so far. Like if you exclude out the China in 2015. What is driving that particular increase in the domain? Is that the cross additions that you are seeing or the high renewal rates from the existing customers that is driving that net additions up? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Sure. This is George. As you saw in the second quarter, we had good performance in net adds from the domain name base. And in the second quarter that primarily came from improved gross adds. Gross adds were $9.6 million versus $9.2 million a year ago in the second quarter and slightly improved renewal rates which were, as Jim mentioned, the preliminary renewal rate for second quarter is 74.9%, up from 74% a year ago. And we expect those trends to continue here into the third quarter. And that really \u2013 those two factors really are the basis of our guidance. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: All right. And if I could squeeze one more in on the operating margins, I mean 68.2% has been really the peak of the margins. But you are guiding to 66%, 67% for 2018. Any particular expenses that you expect in the back half of the year that should drag the margins down from the June quarter level? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, if you look at the second quarter, you can see that our expenses, our non-GAAP expenses were down about $4 million year-over-year. And as I have mentioned before, quarter-to-quarter we do have some timing differences with some spend that we put into the business. And Q4 was lower by that $4 million. Roughly $3 million of it was in marketing and $1 million was in G&A. But we still expect to be around that $100 million expense going forward. And when we think about where they are \u2013 we'll probably see a little bit more in marketing expense go out in subsequent quarters. But we've given \u2013 we really don't guide to quarterly expense or margin. The full year guidance is what we expect we'll fall between for the remainder of the year. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: That's perfect. Really helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Thank you. We'll now take our last question from Matthew Wells with Citi. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. This is Matt Wells with Citi. Thanks for taking my questions. And just digging into growth in the zone file and net adds, can you just talk to where you are seeing strength geographically? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yes. I'd say similar to last quarter, Matt, we continue to see U.S. registrars do well, as well as registrars in China. But the U.S. registrars have performed well for us this year year-to-date. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Are you able to just speak directionally around the breakout between U.S. and China, net add? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Well, for the first half of the year -- I mean, again we know that our (00:15:10) registrars are performing well. I'd say it's fairly balanced between the two areas. I'd say the U.S. is doing a pretty good job but China continues to do well as well. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's great. Thanks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Okay, it's Jim here. Just a clarification on one answer I gave on the Cooperative Agreement, our status there. The statement I made is an accurate statement. I guess I don't speak for NTIA. That process is theirs. But the statement is an accurate statement from VeriSign. I just wanted to be clear on that. Operator : Thank you and that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for any additional or final closing remarks. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.",

Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded and an unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our third quarter 2018 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its longstanding policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterwards we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and delivered solid financial performance including non-GAAP EPS of $1.23, up 23% year-over-year. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.1 million shares for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $151.7 million consisting of 137.6 million names for .com and 14.1 million names for .net. During the third quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2018 will be 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.4% achieved in the year-ago quarter. We now expect full-year 2018 domain name base growth of between 4.2% and 4.6% with an increase to the domain name base for the fourth quarter of 2018 of between 0.9 million to 1.4 million net additions. Beginning with 2019 guidance on our next earnings call, we plan to focus our guidance related to changes in the domain name base on annual changes. Starting next year, we no longer intend to provide guidance on quarterly net additions, this change reflects our commitment to managing the business for long-term growth and stability while aligning all of our guidance to be focused on key annual business and financial metrics. The daily transparency into net additions to the domain name base which is updated twice per day will continue to be available on our website. As indicated in our earnings release today, we have entered into an agreement with NeuStar to sell the rights, economic benefits and obligations in all customer contracts related to our Security Services business. Transaction includes the sale of customer agreements related to our DDoS Protection, Managed DNS, DNS Firewall, and Recursive DNS services. We will retain our proprietary technology, network assets, critical infrastructure, software and public DNS service to focus solely on supporting our core mission which is ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. As part of the transaction, we will continue to support the Security Services customers during the transition to NeuStar pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement that is expected to be executed at closing. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approval and is expected to close shortly following the receipt of such approval. We are committed to focusing on our core mission of providing critical Internet infrastructure including Root Zone management, operation of 2 of the 13 global Internet root servers, operation of .gov and .edu and authoritative resolution for the .com and .net top-level domains which support the majority of global e-commerce. For this reason, we're transitioning our Security Services customers to NeuStar. To update you on our discussion about the Cooperative Agreement, we are mindful of the upcoming expiration and are progressing with the NTIAs to amend the Cooperative Agreement by mutual agreement. When we are able to provide more information, we will do so. I will tell you that we are confident that an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term which is the end of November. However, until that process is complete, there is nothing more that we can disclose at this time. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. And good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $306 million, up 4.6% year-over-year and up by 1.1% sequentially. Operating income for the period totaled $195 million compared with $181 million in the third quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.8% compared to 61.9% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $138 million compared to $115 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.13 in the third quarter of this year compared to $0.93 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $508 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates on our 2018 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter operating expense which excludes $15 million of stock-based compensation totaled $96 million, the same as last quarter and compared to $97 million in the third quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 68.7% compared to 68.2% last quarter and 66.7% in the same quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $151 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.23 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 122.3 million shares. This compares to $1.18 last quarter and $1 in the third quarter of 2017. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $177 million compared with $175 million and $153 million respectively for the third quarter of last year. Now, I'd like to provide updates to our full-year 2018 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.211 billion to $1.216 billion, increased and narrowed from the $1.205 billion to $1.215 billion range provided on our last call. Non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 67% and 67.5%, increased and narrowed from the 66% to 67% range provided on the last call. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million to $84 million, decreased and narrowed from the $82 million to $89 million range provided on our last call. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $40 million to $50 million, decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are still expected to be between $80 million and $90 million, unchanged from our last call. In summary, the company continues to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, George. The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to our shareholders. We continue to work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. And we will go first to Sterling Auty at JPMorgan. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Hey, guys. This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. So, you mention about your agreement with NeuStar to actually sell your Security Service, just so that we can model the out-years perfectly, how much revenue were you getting from that other business and how much margins did that particular business have? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Ugam, this is George, thanks for the question. As I'm sure you're aware, DSS is not a material contributor to our overall business. If the transaction closes before year-end, we do not expect a material impact to our 2018 guidance and we will provide 2019 full-year guidance on our Q4 call which will include any impacts from the transaction once it closes. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Okay, cool. And on the Cooperative Agreement, you mentioned that it can be amended before the expiration date, but given \u2013 if supposed say, the process continued, is there a provision where the Cooperative Agreement can be extended for six months until which you are in the negotiation period? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: I don't have any comments beyond my prepared remarks, so I'll just reiterate that we're progressing with the NTIA to amend the Cooperative Agreement by mutual agreement and that we are confident than an amended agreement can be executed before the expiration of the current term at the end of November, so more when we can. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: All right ,and if I could squeeze one last one in. If you see the operating margins for the current quarter, you see that much of the leverage came from sales and marketing expense. Is it something where it is \u2013 it will be the normal course of business that we see such kind of margins? I know you provided 2018 guidance but just from a qualitative perspective, was there a shift of timing of expenses in the quarter or is it like more that the focus of the business in terms of the investment has changed? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: So, with regard to our Q3 expenses, as you can see and from a non-GAAP basis, our total expenses were about $96 million and we're relatively flat both year-over-year and sequentially. However, as you point out, we did see some movements between the categories. Sequentially, we did have a slight decrease in sales and marketing which was offset by small increases in G&A and cost of goods sold. Now, specifically with sales and marketing sequentially we were down about $2.5 million quarter to quarter, and that primarily was a result of lower direct marketing activities in the quarter. As you may recall, we increased our direct marketing activities late in 2017 with the intent to do more in 2018. However, as we pursued more direct marketing activities outside of the U.S., we found it took and \u2013 it is taking frankly us longer to execute on those direct marketing activities abroad. So really, no change, just I would say the normal ebb and flow of how marketing expenses get deployed into the marketplace. Ugam Kamat - JPMorgan India Pvt Ltd.: Awesome. Thank you so much, guys. Operator : And we'll go next to you, Matthew Wells, at Citi. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. This is Matt Wells and I'm on for Walter Pritchard. I was just curious, what was the catalyst for transitioning your Security Services business to NeuStar? Is there anything to read into the timing here relative to the co-op? George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: No, this is completely independent. It is a decision we made to focus exclusively on our core mission. As you know we operate a great deal of critical infrastructure where we do resolution, of course not only for .com and .net but for .gov and .edu. We do Root Zone management, we operate 2 of the 13 Internet root service and we just decided that focus wasn't consistent with continued pursuit of that business, and transitioning it to NeuStar made sense for that reason, timing independent of anything else that's going on. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, that's helpful. I know I think last time we spoke the .web process was still hung up with ICANN and timing sounded like it was a little uncertain. Do you have any more clarity on that process or where it stands? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: No, no updates at this time. I hope to have some in the near future but nothing to say at this time. Matthew Wells - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And that's it for me. D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: Okay, Matt, thank you. Operator : And moving next to Rob Oliver at Robert W. Baird. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great, good afternoon. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob. So, my question was on the sales and marketing expense as well. George, you mentioned that it was taking a little longer to execute, so is that something \u2013 should we expect that to kind of tick back up, is it still a priority to get that level deployed \u2013 those marketing expenses deployed, so is that something we should expect to tick back up going forward and maybe into 2019. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Well \u2013 as I said earlier, we'll provide 2019 guidance on our next call. But \u2013 look, we are constantly trying to invest in marketing activities. I think the goal there is for domain name sales to increase with marketing activities and we fully pursue activities that we think will drive those results. We have switched year-over-year. We have done more direct marketing this year than we've done in prior years, and I just think we've executed some great campaigns in a variety of markets. But as I said, sometimes the international markets are taking a little bit longer to get that work through. So, I don't think anything is really different there. We continue to focus and make investments in marketing and hopefully that produces increases in domain name sales. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then, my second question was on, Jim, the number of new names processes ticked up nicely this year and been kind of 9.5 million or above each quarter. What's been driving you think, was there any trends or any higher level comments that you could say driving the increase in the number of domains this year? D. James Bidzos - VeriSign, Inc.: I will ask George to comment. I will just say that .com is an incredibly strong brand, you hear me say this all the time and I can't emphasize it enough quite frankly. It's a brand that gets a tremendous amount of exposure, it's the brand that gives you credibility worldwide for your online presence, and I think that has a great deal to do with the continued strength that .com is showing. But George, if you'd like to add some color, please feel free. George E. Kilguss III - VeriSign, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Matt, as you've observed Q3 was a good quarter for us, we delivered 2 million net ads in the quarter which was up from 1.5 million net ads in the third quarter of 2017, and that improvement is primarily result of gross ads. As you point out, gross ads totaled 9.5 million in the quarter. They were up from 8.9 million a year ago. And this was really the same trend that we have witnessed and reported on pretty much all year. We've had continued gross ads performance from both North American and China registrars. They seem to be performing better this year than they did previously and that's been a trend that we've seen in previous quarters and it's continued here into the third quarter. So, again I think it's the strong brand in both those markets and we'll continue to execute on marketing activities to accentuate that brand message into the marketplace. Matt S. Lemenager - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : And with no additional questions at this time, Mr. Atchley, I'll turn things back over to you for any final comments. David Atchley, CFA - VeriSign, Inc.: Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference call.",

Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid year for VeriSign. Fourth quarter and full year 2018 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 2018 was marked by strong financial performance during, which we generated revenues of $1,215 million, $661 million in free cash flow and 2018 full year non-GAAP operating margin of 67.5%. 2018 was a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as the company processed 38.2 million registrations and finished the year with 153 million names. During the year, we marked more than 21 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. As we announced on November 1, last year VeriSign and the Department of Commerce entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement. The amendment among other things permits VeriSign without further approval of the DOC to engage with ICANN to change the .com Registry Agreement to increase wholesale prices for .com domain name registrations and renewals by up to 7% in each of the last four years of each six-year period. Amendment 35 also clarifies that the vertical integration restrictions in the .com Registry Agreement on VeriSign's ability to own an ICANN-accredited registrar apply only as to the .com TLD and not to other services offered by VeriSign. Additionally, Amendment 35 also removes certain unnecessary and burdensome regulations, so that any future renewal of the .com Registry Agreement can occur without DOC approval unless VeriSign were to seek changes to certain key provisions such as further changes to pricing. Any change to the Cooperative Agreement can only be made by mutual agreement of VeriSign and the DOC except that the DOC can terminate the Cooperative Agreement at any time with 120 days' notice prior to the expiration of the term. As another update, the company completed the sale of the Verisign Security Services customer contracts on December 5, 2018. These contracts are related primarily to our DDoS and Managed DNS customers. As discussed last quarter, the sale of these non-core customer contracts will enable us to focus solely on supporting our core mission ensuring the security, stability and resiliency of our core infrastructure. Of course, the sale of these customer contracts will be a slight drag on revenue in 2019, but our continued organic revenue growth from our core domain name business is expected to offset this decrease. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 153 million consisting of 139 million names for .com and 14 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.5%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 9.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.29 million names. Although, the renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 will be 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.2% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017. Looking forward to 2019, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.25% and 4.25% for full year 2019. During the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.2 million shares of common stock for $175 million. During the full year 2018, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $600 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $603 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial position remains strong with $1.27 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the company generated revenue of $1.215 billion, up 4.3% from 2017 and delivered GAAP operating income of $767 million, up 8.4% from $708 million in 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled $307 million, up 4% year-over-year and up by 5.5% sequentially. As it relates to fourth quarter GAAP results, operating income totaled $194 million compared with $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.1% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $182 million compared to $103 million a year earlier, which produced dilutive earnings per share of $1.50 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.83 for the same quarter last year. In the quarter, we recorded a $54.8 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of Verisign Security Services customer contracts. This gain increased GAAP net income by $52 million and GAAP earnings per share by $0.43. As of December 31, 2018, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.3 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $504 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional fourth quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide our 2019 full year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, fourth quarter operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $102 million compared to $96 million last quarter and $106 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 66.7% compared to 68.7% last quarter and 64.1% in the same quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter, our sales and marketing expense increased sequentially as we had additional spend on programs in the market. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $191 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.58 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 121.3 million shares. This compares to $1.23 last quarter and $0.96 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts increased non-GAAP net income by $42.8 million and non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.36 during the fourth quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $219 million and free cash flow was $211 million, compared with $199 million and $190 million respectively for the fourth quarter last year. Now I'd like to provide our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year 2019 of between 2.25% and 4.25%, being partially offset by the loss of our revenue associated with the sale of our Security Service customer contracts. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5% and will continue to include certain non-material operating costs associated with providing transition services for Security Service customers. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consist primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by payments collected as part of the aforementioned Transition Services Agreement. Capital expenditures in 2019 are expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. And finally, cash taxes are expected to be between $95 million and $115 million. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate solid financial performance in 2018 during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. 2018 was another solid year for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and revenues. We generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We entered into Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, allowing VeriSign to engage with ICANN to amend the COM Agreement to increase the price for com domain name registrations and renewals without further approval from the Department of Commerce. We concluded the sale of our Security Services customer contracts, further increasing our focus and efforts to protect, grow and manage this unique business. The success in our core business benefits our customers employees and shareholders. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And first we'll hear from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi guys. So, ICANN 35 certainly is beneficial for you guys. But given all the moving parts, can you just simply explain what is different? Jim Bidzos : Sure Sterling. I think most are aware that the main points I just mentioned in Amendment 35 are that we're allowed to increase prices for .com. We have more flexibility on vertical integration for services that are not .com services and there is reduced regulatory burden for both VeriSign and the government. I think your question is in practice what will be different for us VeriSign. So, I'll contrast a process before and after Amendment 35. But let me just -- let me start with what will not change. Every six years, we engage with ICANN on a .com Registry Agreement renewal for which there's a presumptive Right of Renewal. That is not changed and the next renewal of the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN will occur in November of 2024. Some parts of the agreement may be changed in that process through negotiation. However, I'd note that ICANN has not historically negotiated pricing with us deferring to DOC on pricing in prior renewals. That process -- that ICANN process is unchanged. Prior -- to pick up there, prior to Amendment 35, the process that followed that renewal with ICANN was that we would present the .com Registry Agreement as negotiated by us, VeriSign and ICANN to the DOC. DOC would then review it based on a two-pronged test of one, our performance on security and stability and two, a review of whether we were \"providing registry services on reasonable prices terms and conditions.\" And a standard applied for these tests was called the public interest standard and then DOC's consent to the COM Registry Agreement renewal following this review was required. So, they have to consent to what we had done with ICANN. Amendment 35 founded in the public interest to allow the following; first one for us to raise .com registration and renewal prices 7% in the back four years of each six-year period; two, that the restriction on vertical integration was only intended to apply to .com; three, that the review process is now streamlined such that any NTIA review any DOC review and consent is no longer required provided that the COM Registry Agreement has not changed pricing from what's now allowed, specifically, the 7% noted -- I noted a minute ago. Also that the performance specs or SLAs in the COM Registry Agreement that we have to perform to have not been changed and also that we've not changed the vertical integration restriction on COM and that we have not changed the renewal or termination terms of the COM Registry Agreement; and five, that there's been no changes to the WHOIS services. Given all of those then consent from the NTIA or DOC to the renewal of the COM Registry Agreement is not required if these terms are not changed. So, further in such a case and absent any VeriSign and DOC mutually agreed changes, the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew, again, without reviewing consent as is for another six-year term. So, one could see the Cooperative Agreement will automatically renew again without reviewing consent as is for another 6-year term. So one could see the Cooperative Agreement now as evergreen without further review, given the terms stay the same. NTIA has also a right to terminate the Cooperative Agreement on 120 days' notice before the end of the term. So there is one other change which is that VeriSign agrees to quote, continue to operate the .com registry in a content-neutral manner, which of course we've always done. So that's basically Amendment 35 and what will be different for us although of course parts of the Cooperative Agreement including earlier amendments that had to be modified or deleted to make Amendment 35 work were also changed. But essentially that's it. Long answer sorry about that but... Sterling Auty : That's okay. But two -- I know these calls are relatively short typically so I'm going to take the opportunity to ask a couple of questions to follow up on it. The first one is, so the Cooperative Agreement has changed, but I haven't seen any news. Do you have to go back and actually refresh or change the .com Registry Agreement to now incorporate the same pricing parameters that's there in Item 35? Or is that kind of already de facto happened because of what you did with Item 35? Jim Bidzos : Well historically and in this case as well there is a process for that. There's a process for moving changes from the DOC to the Cooperative Agreement into the .com Registry Agreement. ICANN has historically as I mentioned deferred to the U.S. government on matters relating to com pricing. But ICANN and VeriSign have an agreement to cooperate and negotiate -- there's a written agreement to operate -- cooperate and negotiate in good faith to amend the com registry as may be necessary for consistency with changes to the Cooperative Agreement. So we have begun that process with ICANN to amend the agreement to make these changes including pricing. And I don't think I can comment further to process. We've been through it a few times. It may take a number of months to work through it, but we'll update you as appropriate. Sterling Auty : All right, great. And then on the vertical integration, the way that I read that if we look back through the history of Network Solutions to VeriSign to where you are today once upon a time you were both registry and registrar. This appears to open up the ability for you to be a registrar as long as it's not for .com. Is this indicating that you would be interested in entering and becoming a registrar again, perhaps for the .web? Jim Bidzos : Well first of all it was -- as I mentioned earlier this is a clarification that, that restriction only applies to .com. So .web or any other services that we offer technically are no longer covered with this modification. How that language would apply to our business, how we would use it, how it stands today? I think is it's too early to say how that flexibility might be applied, if it's applied. But that clarification is now made and the vertical integration restriction only applies to .com. And you're right, we did have both when we acquired Network Solutions in June of 2000. And then I think it was in 2003 or early 2004 we sold off the registrar. But I think at that time the agreement read that VeriSign couldn't be vertically integrated. And I think at that time VeriSign and .com were entirely synonymous, so this clarifies that and it applies -- the restriction only applies to .com, and as I said, too early to say how or if we'll use that flexibility. Sterling Auty : All right, great. Let me turn it over. And I will hop back in queue. Thank you. Jim Bidzos : I am sorry. Sterling Auty : I was saying, thank you I will turn the call over to next question. Operator : And it looks like our last question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird. Matt Lemenager : Thanks. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob tonight. Guys, is there any update on .web kind of what are the remaining steps there? I know that's a process. Could you kind of help us understand what the remaining steps would be there? And then secondly on .web, what type of factors are you using to evaluate potential pricing there and what that might look like? Because I think we understand, it can be unlimited or I guess unrestricted and you can charge premium pricing like you've talked about in the past. So are there any examples of what you're using to evaluate what that premium pricing might look like? Jim Bidzos : Thanks for the questions. So, first of all, the update that I can offer since we last spoke on the process towards delegation of .web is that one of the losing bidders in the .web auction a company named Afilias who is one of our competitors has filed an arbitration against ICANN trying to continue to delay the process. We are not parties to that arbitration yet, but we are actively seeking to join and participate in it. About your question, about pricing and what we might do two parts to that answer. Number one is, yes .web is not a regulated TLD like .com is or even like .net is. It's a TLD that would be operating under the new form the new so-called New gTLD Registry Agreement. And those agreements do not limit pricing similar to our IDNs, which are also signed up to the same form of agreement. They only require 6-month notice for any price change, but they provide complete pricing flexibility. As to what we would do, how we would do premium pricing, how we would price .web, how we're thinking about it, I think it's very premature at this stage really to say anything. And it just occurs to me too that back to Sterling's second question, he asked about, how we would use vertical integration, just to be complete. That ICANN process of incorporating all the Amendment 35 changes into the .com Registry Agreement pricing et cetera also applies to these other changes the clarification of what vertical integration restriction actually exists et cetera, so all that is subject to completing this process with ICANN that I described earlier. And I apologize I'd like to tell you more about .web, but it's just premature to talk about what we would do or how we're thinking about that at this point. But your assumptions about the flexibility that .web would offer based on the agreement, it would operate under are correct. It would not be restricted and we'd have flexibility to price premiums or whichever way we chose. Matt Lemenager : Okay. That's helpful color. And then on the -- the next one's kind of high level. But so the domain name base for growth for 2019 the 2.25% to 4.25%, what could you tell us about what geographies are North America or international? Not looking for specific numbers or anything, but what kind of pockets of strength are you expecting there? Or which parts might be more of a headwind? Anything just directionally, no specific numbers, but what markets kind of look like they might be driving that? George Kilguss : Well what I can tell you Matt is that in 2018 as we've been talking about all year, we've seen good growth from registrars in both the U.S. registrars, in both registrars located over in the China market. So those at least in 2018 have been good markets for us for growth. As you talk about 2019, obviously we're a global business. We factor a lot of things going on into our range. But we still expect as you -- as we talked about the domain name base to grow between 2.25% up to 4.25%. So just exactly where that growth is, I mean we're not giving a specific guidance there but we do see that there's been a good growth this year and we're looking for growth in the range that we outlined in our guidance. Matt Lemenager : Okay. Sounds good. Thanks guys. I\u2019ll turn it back over to Sterling Operator : And it looks like we will be taking our final questions a follow-up from Sterling with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Thanks. We could just do this as an open forum and go back and forth. Just a couple more. I wanted to ask, I get a number of questions actually on the cash taxes and the cash tax rate. So if I just do the simplistic and look at the cash taxes here for 2019, how should we think about -- actually maybe I'll just leave it to you, how should we think about the cash tax rate both in 2019 and going forward? Is this structural and it can maintain this rate? Or should it elevate to some other level? And what would be the driving factors to that? George Kilguss : Yeah, thanks for that Sterling. So as you know in 2018, cash taxes were about $85 million and that translates to about 12% effective cash tax rate and that's compared to our GAAP taxes of about $147 million, which if you do that math that translated into an effective tax rate of about in the low-20% range. So for 2019 as you know we've guided cash taxes to be between $95 million to $115 million. And if you do that math that still would be below our GAAP effective tax rate. And that's the result because we're still using up some foreign tax credits and state NOLs. And while we don't provide a long-term cash tax rate, we do expect our cash tax effective rate to accrete closer up to our GAAP effective rate over the next few years as we fully utilize those remaining attributes. Sterling Auty : Excellent. And then the last one for me. You increased the share repurchase. I missed what you said. How much was left at the end of the quarter for repurchase before you went to the -- to $1 billion? And what was the thought in terms of the timing of now to expand? Because a lot of people wonder if you would lever up again and maybe get even more aggressive on the repurchase front? George Kilguss : So, before we went back for authorization, we were just under $400 million remaining under that program before we went to the board and had it reauthorized up to $1 billion. Sterling Auty : All right. Great. And then just that last part of it. Maybe an update on what your thought is around optimal capital structure the potential to maybe add debt and be a little bit more aggressive this year within that buyback. George Kilguss : Yeah. As you know, Sterling we constantly review the needs of the business and we try to make our decisions that are in the best interest of the company. And as we've talked about many times that's a pretty active process we go through each quarter. Jim and I sit down and look at the specific needs. We don't have a specific leverage target that we manage to. We try to use our protect grow and manage framework to make sure that we're maintaining the optimal level of liquidity. At present, we're looking ahead to what investment opportunities we need to make the business grow and then we're thinking about what the appropriate return of capital is to shareholders. And so, I don't really have anything to report at this time. We continue to look at the marketplace and then what the needs of the business are and we'll continue to do that in a very active fashion. Jim Bidzos : Yes and Sterling, Jim here. I would just add too that Amendment 35 was a significant event for us and in 2018 and it does afford us additional flexibility in a number of different areas, and I think we've certainly talked about that enough. But just fully understanding it, and factoring it into our strategic thinking. I think is just something that we do need to consider. And so that's a process that's underway too. So, as George said there's just really nothing specific to say about at this point. Sterling Auty : All right. Sounds good. Thank you, guys. Jim Bidzos : Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for any final remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and our presentation are being webcast from our Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you'll also find our first quarter 2019 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David. Good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 154.8 million, consisting of 141 million names for .com and 13.8 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.4%. During the first quarter, we processed 9.8 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.82 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2019 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.3% achieved in the first quarter of 2018. For 2019 full-year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 2.5% and 4.25%. Last quarter, we said that we began the process with ICANN to incorporate features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement including the pricing terms into the .com Registry Agreement. There are no updates to share at this time, but we continue to be engaged in this process that may take some number of months to complete. Just to remind those not familiar with this process under the 2016 amendment that extended the term of the .com Registry Agreement, we also agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow-through changes made in the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms and to preserve and enhance the security and stability of .com or the Internet. We are negotiating these items now, and we'll update you as appropriate. During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.0 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remains strong with $1.25 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks Jim, and good afternoon everyone. First quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 2.4% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $106 million, compared to $114 million last quarter and $113 million in the first quarter a year ago. Within the quarter were lower sequentially, primarily due to the elimination of approximately $3 million of costs associated with our Security Services sale last quarter, and the seasonal timing of marketing program spend. Operating income totaled $200 million, compared with $185 million in the first quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.4%, compared to 62% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $163 million, compared to $134 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.35 in the quarter this year compared to $1.09 for the same quarter last year. As of March 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.25 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $685 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. During the quarter, we repatriated $249 million from our international entities net of withholding taxes. I'll now review some additional first quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, first quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $94 million, compared to $102 million last quarter and $101 million in the first quarter a year ago. Operating margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 66.7% last quarter and 66.3% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $158 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 120.3 million shares. This compares to $1.58 last quarter and $1.07 in the first quarter of 2018. Last quarter's non-GAAP diluted earnings per share included a $0.36 benefit due to the gain related to the sale of our Security Services customer contracts. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $187 million and free cash flow was $178 million compared to -- with $90 million and $82 million respectively for the first quarter last year. Last year's first quarter 2018 cash flow included higher cash taxes related to international withholding taxes associated with last year's repatriation activities as well as higher cash interest related to our convertible debentures before they were retired. Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion now from the $1.215 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 of between 2.5% and 4.25% being partially offset by the loss of revenue associated with the sale of our Security Services customer contracts. Our non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 67.5% to 68.5%, and we'll continue to include certain nonmaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for the security service customers. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement. Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million to $55 million and cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $105 million lowered from the $95 million to $115 million range provided on our last call. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2019. Now I would like to turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thanks George. The first quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth. And we generated an efficiently returned value to shareholders. We continue to work, our work to protect grow. And manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We'll now take your questions. And operator we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Q \u2013 Sterling Auty : Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. I wondered if we could start with -- I didn't hear an update on .web, anything that you can share with us there? A \u2013 Jim Bidzos : There are no updates from .web at this point. The process continues Q \u2013 Sterling Auty : Okay. And then, you mentioned that there is no update yet in terms of the Registry Agreement. Is there a formal process that you're going through? Or is just the discussion and negotiation? And can you at least say whether or not there\u2019s active discussions' going on? A \u2013 Jim Bidzos : Well, we are engaged in the process. The process as we described it is under the 2016 amendment that extended the term of the com agreement. We've agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow-through changes that come from the Cooperative Agreement that includes, the pricing terms and also to preserve and enhance the security and stability of .com and the Internet. We're renegotiating those items now. Updates when appropriate, but I don't want to get into any particulars of the negotiation of course. Q \u2013 Sterling Auty : Yeah. No, no. I just didn't know if there was particularly, publicly available information in terms of, if there is milestones that we should be looking for other than just a full update here as to the new agreement. I just wanted to make sure that we're covering our bases. Jim Bidzos : Yeah, I understand. We'll update you as appropriate. Sterling Auty : Okay. Sounds good. Two more. Just one any commentary in terms of the geographic when in terms of the name base and the gross registrations. What did you see geographically domestic/international? And specifically within international, any color that you can provide in terms of what you saw out of the various regions? George Kilguss : Yes. Sterling, this is George. I would say consistent with the recent quarters we continue to see both the U.S. market and the Chinese registrars perform quite well and they've been a lot of the driver for the past couple of quarters and they continue to be good markets for us. Sterling Auty : And within that Chinese portion obviously going back we have the speculative nature. Do you feel like the names being added today are healthier growth meaning that they're being driven by more fundamental reasons that will make them stickier names? George Kilguss : I can just tell you in the data that I look at from a renewal rate perspective. I haven't seen any change in the normal renewal rates that we historically see from Chinese registrars. So obviously it was a 45-days lag, but I don't see any deviation at least year-to-date in those numbers. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then last question around the TSA post the sale of those contracts, how long is that TSA? And within other income, is there a little bit of color in terms of the magnitude of that TSA? George Kilguss : Yeah, sure. It's a 12-month agreement. It expires in December of this year. Having said that the parties do have the ability to extend that should they desire to do so. We recognized about $4 million of income in the quarter. It's in our non -- our other income. And so it's about $1.3 million a month is the income associated with that contract. Sterling Auty : All right. Perfect. Thank you. Jim Bidzos : Yeah. Sterling, it's Jim. Just -- you asked me about .web and I said that there is no update. But I just feel I should remind everyone that one of the losing bidders in the .web auction Afilias one of our competitors, they filed an arbitration against ICANN as you probably know trying to continue to delay the process. We're not parties to that arbitration, yet but we are actively seeking to participate in it. Sterling Auty : Great. Thank you. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Nick Jones with Citi. Nick Jones : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Is there any kind of broader trends in nTLDs or country code TLDs that you could call out that maybe is impacting .com demand internationally? George Kilguss : I think that, look the TLD market is a competitive market both .com and .net receive compensation from ccTLDs primarily in international markets. But new gTLD and legacy TLDs also provide competition. But we'll continue to compete effectively with those TLDs. You can see the zone they grow about 4.4% this quarter. New registrations were up about 2.1% year-over-year. So we're still competing effectively in the markets that we're in, but it is a competitive market out there. Nick Jones : Thanks. And one follow-up on I guess the .web arbitration. What \u2013 how long or what would the process look like for VeriSign to join that arbitration and kind of get involved? Jim Bidzos : Well, I hate to make this sound like a stock line but it is. I mean, we don't comment on any detailed aspects of any pending litigation, but it's \u2013 right now it's an arbitration between Afilias and ICANN and we're seeking as you pointed out to participate. Beyond that, I just don't have any update to provide. But as soon as we do, we'll let you know. Nick Jones : Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Hey. Thanks guys for taking my question. Jim, sorry not to go back to .web but I think you guys had indicated on the last call that that process could take a few months. Is that something that might take longer in your experience now since it's been a few months now since Afilias had filed that arbitration? Or is there just kind of no way for us to know and there's a process? Just any color would be helpful there. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Well, I think it's the latter. I mean, having been involved in a number of arbitrations, you obviously can't predict at what rate the wheels of justice will turn. But well, they may turn they are turning. So as soon as we have updates we'll certainly share them. Rob Oliver : Great. Thanks. And it's come up a bit lately with clients as well as on some of your calls about the idea of kind of vertically integrating on the registrar and registry side again. I just wanted to kind of see, if I can pump you guys for your thoughts on that here quickly. Jim Bidzos : Yeah. Nothing specific to say at this point, it's just there's nothing to add to what we've already said. Rob Oliver : Okay. That's it for me. Thank you guys very much. Jim Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : And I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to Verisign's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's second quarter 2019 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About Verisign on verisign.com. There you will also find our second quarter 2019 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail on our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q , which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Verisign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by Verisign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for Verisign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. At the end of June, the domain name base in dot-com and dot-net totaled 156.1 million, consisting of 142.5 million names for dot-com and 13.6 million names for dot-net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.3%. During the second quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.34 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2019 will be approximately 74%. This preliminary rate compares to 75% achieved in the second quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3% and 4.25 % narrowed from our previous range of 2.5% to 4.25%. As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in a process with ICANN to incorporate terms of Amendment 35 for the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into the dot-com registry agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to the dot-com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the dot-com registry. We agreement -- we and ICANN also agreed to negotiate in good faith to flow through any changes that would be made to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms, and in addition to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the dot-com registry or the Internet. These discussions with ICANN are ongoing. And at this time, there are no further details to share. Of course when appropriate, we will update you. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 0.9 million shares of common stock for $175 million. Our financial position remained strong, with $1.22 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, we continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Second quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $306 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $105 million compared to $106 million last quarter and $109 million in the second quarter a year ago. Operating income totaled $202 million compared with $193 million in the second quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.9% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $128 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.24 in the second quarter of this year compared to $1.04 for the same quarter last year. As of June 30th, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $582 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $91 million compared to $94 million last quarter and $96 million in the second quarter a year ago. The slight year-over-year decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 70.1% compared to 69.4% last quarter and $68.2% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $159 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.33 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 119.4 million shares. This compares to $1.31 last quarter and $1.18 in the second quarter of 2018. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $165 million and free cash flow was $154 million compared with $202 million and $191 million respectively for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decline was a result of the timing of cash tax payments, which were predominantly made in Q1 last year versus occurring in the second quarter this year. Now, I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion, narrowed from the $1.220 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. Our 2019 revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full year of 2019 to between 3% and 4.25%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 68% and 69%, increased from the 67.5% to 68.5% range provided on our last call, and we'll continue to include certain immaterial operating costs associated with providing transition services for Security Service customers. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $42 million and $49 million and consists primarily of net interest expense, partially offset by income recognized as part of the aforementioned transition services agreement. Capital expenditures in 2019 are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $100 million, narrowed from the $85 million to $105 million range provided previously. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2019. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, George. The second quarter was another solid quarter for Verisign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth. We generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. Last week, the company marked 22 years of 100% availability in the dot-com and dot-net domain name system. This achievement is a result of the dedication and expertise of our team and our specialized infrastructure. We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first today from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Maybe two to kick off. Jim, can you give us an update on where things stand with the dot-web arbitration and situation? Jim Bidzos : Hi, Sterling. Thanks. Sure. Since we last spoke to you, there has been some movement in the process. ICANN has filed a response to affiliates as complaint, which is a public response and it's posted on ICANN's website. So, there is some movement, but beyond that we don't have any update. As a reminder, one of the losing bidders in the dot-web auction, Afilias, one of our competitors, filed this arbitration in November of 2018 against ICANN trying to continue to delay the process. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we are continuing to seek to participate in the proceedings. Sterling Auty : All right, great. And then, you noticed -- noted the initial renewal rate 74% is down. Anything in particular in terms of either the types of names that didn't renew at the same rate or a mix of first year renewals versus multi -- second time or more renewal names, anything that's being kind of call out that drove that trend? George Kilguss : Sure, Sterling. This is George. So, as far as our renewal rates are, as you know, our preliminary renewal rate is estimated at 74%, which is down about 1% year-over-year. I'd say, one of the prime contributors is a slightly lower first time renewal rate, which is being driven by a higher proportion of names coming up for renewal from our Chinese registrars. As we've talked before, historically China like other emerging domain name markets have lower renewal rates, more than say mature markets like the US and Europe. And so, accordingly, what we're seeing is that the first time renewal rate is being impacted by this weighted average effective more Chinese names coming up for renewal. Sterling Auty : And is that also impacting the 10.3 million new names processed towards the upper end of what we typically see. Was that also being impacted by China or what other influences did you see there? George Kilguss : Yeah. I think the short answer is yes. As we've talked about in previous quarters, some of the big drivers are registrars operating both in China and the US, but we're seeing a lot of registrars perform well in Q2, but China continues to perform well for us. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then, just last question, given the results on the operating income and operating margin line for the first half, to get down to the full-year guidance would suggest some compression and operating margins in the back half of the year. What are going to be some of the investments and sort of things that we should look for that would cause that to happen? George Kilguss : Yeah. Sure, Sterling. So, maybe the best way to answer that is just to talk about some of the variances year-over-year, and then I can give you some color as to the rest of the year. But year-over-year, our expenses are down by about $4.7 million, $91.4 million were end of the quarter. And the two big costs there of being down year-over-year, one is about $2.5 million of costs associated with VSS. We again sold that business last year. And then the remaining $2 million of that variance is really related to the timing of investments in telco and networking in our network. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. As we go forward here, we -- and as we say in our Q that's filed this afternoon, we expect that we will have slight increases as a percent of revenue for both sales and marketing, for cost of goods sold and for G&A as well, but we continue to invest in our network. We'll probably still spend some more money in sales and marketing next year, and we'll continue to invest in our cyber activities throughout the year, which falls in the G&A. Sterling Auty : All right, perfect. Thank you so much, guys. Jim Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : We'll hear next from Nick Jones with Citi. Nick Jones : Hi, thanks for taking the question. I saw some headlines that ICANN uncapped dot-org pricing rate increases. Do you have any comments what ICANN -- what kind of ICANN's move may mean for the broader industry? Does it have any kind of future implications for dot-com or dot-net? Is it possible that you could get uncapped in the future or is there any kind of color or commentary you guys have around that? Jim Bidzos : Sure. Well, these new agreements that ICANN negotiated are more like the new generic TLD program agreements in that they no longer have price caps, but they do have to practice uniform pricing and provide the customary advance notices of any changes to pricing. So implementing the pricing features of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement for us simply restores the pricing flexibility to formerly existed for com domains from 2006 to 2012, the ability to unilaterally increase prices by up to 7% 4 times during the six-year term of the Registry Agreement. So, the ICANN registry agreements for Oregon bids [Phonetic] by the way, were renewed late June and they completely lifted their price cap. So, we can't speculate of similar approach will be used for the next renewal of dot-net. And as you know, the pricing for dot-com is regulated by the Cooperative Agreement. So that's really a different animal in that process. Nick Jones : Got it. Is there may be a tilt for ICANN to take a more hands off approach and have to be less involves sort of trend, maybe you're seeing or is it kind of -- it seems kind of more like a one-off? Jim Bidzos : Well, I can't speak for ICANN but I can tell you that they did, as I mentioned. These agreements are now more like the generic TLD agreements and they do have roughly 1,000 of those, and those are somewhat standardized and they don't have price caps. Nick Jones : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Our final question will be from Rob Oliver with Baird. Matt Lemenager : Great, thanks. It's Matt Lemenager on for Rob tonight. I had a question on the -- Jim, I wanted to ask about now your ability to vertically integrate. I think on the last call you said that something you guys would put -- think about internally but no update at that time. Just wanted to see if anything changed. Is there any discussion on what that might look like or what you could look like if you chose to vertically integrate there? Jim Bidzos : Yeah. No, nothing to update since the last time we talked about that. Really nothing specific at this point that changes. We'll certainly let you know. Matt Lemenager : But again, that's only for the non-comp TLDs? Jim Bidzos : Dot-com is not part of that, of course. I think you're aware of that. Matt Lemenager : Yeah. Jim Bidzos : Yeah. But nothing to update at this point. Sorry. Matt Lemenager : Okay. And then, just one thing on the -- do you think there is any -- it sounds like it's mostly registrars in China and the US, but I'm just looking at the $10.3 million gross new names and that accelerated -- second quarter in a row, it accelerated. Do you expect, I mean, ahead of the late October timeframe next year when prices are going to be increasing. Do you think there is any rush of people to come and buy names ahead of those price increases or the price increases maybe not substantial enough that people it may not matter and it may not drive business ahead of that? Jim Bidzos : I really couldn't speculate on the price increase. I mean, we see demand in markets drive from continued penetration of the Internet, continued growth of e-commerce sales and people getting online. And we see those trends continuing. We think domain names in general benefit from that and we're trying to compete in the market against other TLDs in the market, internationally CCTLDs and new GTLDs for that matter. So, we just see continued demand in markets where e-commerce is flourishing and we think domains are a part of that. Matt Lemenager : Okay, got it. And then, just my last one, the process on the dot-com pricing with ICANN. Is that something that's maybe taking longer than you thought to get that amendment or is this about the timeframe that you thought nothing outside of the time frame that you expect it to get that kind of stamp of approval from the ICANN RA amendment? Jim Bidzos : So we're actively engaged in this process, as I said, and we won't be able to comment and don't comment on any details of discussions. And like I said in my prepared remarks, we're going through a process to incorporate the terms approved in Amendment 35, including the pricing terms into the com agreement with ICANN. But also, as part of the 2016 amendment, Verisign and ICANN, a 2016 amendment that we made back then to extend the com agreement, Verisign and ICANN agreed to negotiate in good faith the flow through those changes, including pricing, but in addition to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the com registry of the Internet. So no updates beyond that. Matt Lemenager : Okay, all right. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, George. Jim Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I'd like to turn things back to David Atchley for closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Again that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us.",

James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign. Our results are in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. At the end of September, the domain name base in dot-com and net totaled 157.1 million, consisting of 144 million names for dot-com and 13.4 million names for dot-net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the third quarter, we processed 9.9 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.27 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.8% achieved in the third quarter of 2018. For 2019 full year, we now expect the domain name base growth rate to be between 3.2% and 3.7 %. As noted during our recent earnings calls, we are engaged in a process with ICANN to incorporate the terms of Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement, including the pricing terms into our dot-com registry agreement. For those not familiar with this, let me remind you that under the 2016 amendment to our com registry agreement with ICANN, which extended the term of the agreement, we and ICANN also agree to negotiate in good faith to do two things; first, we agree to reflect changes to the Cooperative Agreement in the com agreement, including pricing terms. Second, we agree to amend the com agreement to include terms to preserve and enhance the security and stability of the com registry or the Internet. We believe these discussions with ICANN are nearly complete. While it will be inappropriate at this time to provide more details, I can say that we were satisfied with the results so far. As noted, this is an ICANN process and we expect that before long ICANN will be publishing for public comment the documents we have been discussing. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1 million shares of common stock for $194 million. Our financial position remained strong with $1.23 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. we continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thank you, Jim and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter GAAP results produced revenue of $308 million up 0.9% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $103 million compared to $105 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter a year ago. The small sequential quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating expenses is primarily a result of the timing of spend related to some sales and marketing programs. Year-over-year the decrease in operating expenses is primarily due to lower expenses as a result of the sale of our Security Services business, as well as the timing of spend related to periodic and planned changes to and investments in our infrastructure. Operating income totaled $206 million compared with $195 million in the third quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 66.7% compared to 63.8% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $154 million compared to $138 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.30 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.13 for the same quarter last year. As of September 30, 2019, the company maintained total assets of $1.9 billion and total liabilities of $3.3 billion. Assets included $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which $511 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. I'll now review some additional third quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then provide updates to our 2019 full-year guidance. As it relates to non-GAAP metrics, third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation totaled $90 million compared to $91 million last quarter and $96 million in the third quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 70.8% compared to 70.1% last quarter and 68.7% in the same quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $161 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.36 based on a weighted average diluted share count of $118.6 million shares. This compares to $1.33 last quarter and $1.23 in the third quarter of 2018. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $208 million and free cash flow was $197 million compared with the $187 million and $177 million respectively for the third quarter last year. Beginning with the first quarter 2020 earnings results, we plan to eliminate our discussion and presentation of non-GAAP measures with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA on which we will continue to report. As a result, our full-year 2020 guidance, which we will provide on our next call, will only include GAAP metrics. This change is the culmination of the declining trend and influence of our non-GAAP adjustments over the last several years and is consistent with the evolving trends and best practices in financial reporting. Now I'd like to provide updates to our full year 2019 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.228 billion to $1.233 million narrowed from the $1.225 billion to $1.235 billion range provided on our last call. This revenue range is based on our expectation for continued growth of our domain name base for the full-year 2019 of between 3.2% and 3.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 69.5% and 70% increased and narrowed from the 68% to 69% range provided on our last call. Our interest expense and non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $44 million to $49 million narrowed from the $42 million to $49 million range provided on our last call. Capital expenditures in 2019 are now expected to be between $40 million and $50 million decreased from the $45 million to $55 million range provided on our last call. Cash taxes are now expected to be between $85 million and $95 million narrowed from the $85 million to $100 million range provided previously. To recap, Verisign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2019. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thanks George. The third quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign. There was further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth we generated and efficiently returned value to our shareholders. We continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. And we'll now take your questions. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question today from Rob Oliver with Baird. MattLemenager: Good afternoon. It is Matt Lemenager on for Rob. I appreciate the comments around the ICANN Registry Agreement negotiation. So when -- as we look forward, could you remind us once the public comment period would open up, what does the timeline look like after that? I believe you have to give a six-month notification period before making you can make any formal changes in pricing. So I assume that entire review period with ICANN would be complete by kind of the April 2020 would kind of be the timeframe that it would need to be completed by? But could you just remind us what the timeline looks like after the public comment period opens? James Bidzos : Sure Matt. Yes, let me explain how what we expect in the public comment period with the caveat that this is an ICANN process, so I can't speak with certainty and I don't speak for ICANN, but I kind of tell you what the expectation is and what they typically do. As I mentioned, we will expect them to shortly publish these documents for comment. Comment period, ICANN's comment periods are typically about 40 days. There is typically a short period where they review the comments and then after that it's normally expected that some action would be taken on approval on that process. Again, it's ICANN process, I can't tell you with certainty, but that's typically what they do and that's basically an expectation based on what they've done in the past. In terms of any price increases, we don't guide to pricing. We need to finalize this ICANN process first. So I can't offer you any details on that, but hopefully that answered your question. Matt Lemenager : Yes, that's helpful. And then another one on kind of the newer initiatives I suppose, is there any update to dot-web and the process there? James Bidzos : Yes, actually there is some new information since we spoke to you last quarter on dot-web. Just for the benefit, I guess if everybody else on the call for context, there was an auction for dot-web and one of the losing bidders, a company called Afilias, a competitor of ours, filed what is a form of an arbitration proceeding called an IRP in November 2018. That's against ICANN and as a reminder ICANN filed a response to the complaint. We're not a party to that arbitration, but we have filed a request asking to participate in that arbitration as an interested party, which is allowed by ICANN's rules. So the update is that since last quarter, kind of a significant update I guess is that an arbitration panel has been appointed, convened. It actually held a hearing just very recently, a couple of weeks ago on our request to request to participate, that hearing was held and we expect a ruling on that issue of our participation before the end of the year. Matt Lemenager : Okay, got it. And then lastly just on the sales and marketing expense, is down 28% every year, I think it is a couple close in a row that has declined. I mean, do you -- is there any expectation, would that go, just trying to take the bottom [ph] of that out into 2020 it seems like with that level off at some point as we kind of do dot-web and put marketing dollars behind that, or anything, if you could give any color around the sales and marketing expense? George Kilguss : Yes, sure Matt, this is George. So, as mentioned in my prepared remarks, the big change in expense year-over-year really is a result of sale of our VSS business. As it relates to sales and marketing, there was -- most of that expense came out of sales and marketing year-over-year. So that's primarily the year-over-year decline. As far as where sales and marketing is going in the future, we will provide -- we don\u2019t provide guidance on the individual segments, but we will give you an idea of our expectation for next year on our call in February. Matt Lemenager : Okay, got it, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question will come from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Let's start with the renewal rate in the quarter down year-over-year, can you give us some context or color, is there any particular region or factor that led to that decline? George Kilguss : Sure Sterling. This is George. Regarding renewal rates, our Q3 preliminary renewal rate is expected to be down about 1.2% or 73.6% year-over-year. When you consider the two major components of our renewal rates, our previous renewed rate has held consistent in the mid 80% range, both year-over-year and sequentially. However, we've seen a slight decrease in our first time renewal rate in the quarter. And while there's a variety of factors that can influence that, it for us has really been a geographic mix in the quarter. As we previously mentioned, China registrars first time renewal rate, as well as what we call the emerging markets had historically lower first time renewal rates. Then let's say more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe and as China has continued to grow for us in 2018 and again in 2019 it is really this change in geographic mix which is causing a little bit of downward pressure on the first time renewal rate. Sterling Auty : So that makes sense, so maybe a followup is, the 9.9 million new names processed in the quarter, can you give us maybe a little bit more granularity as to what the geographic makeup of that looks like and how that has trended over the last year? James Bidzos : Well, you point to the 9 .9 million gross adds and that's a good stack for us, I mean gross adds were up 3.5% year-over-year in the third quarter which actually was a record gross add third quarter for us, so continued good demand for the product in the third quarter here. As far as the regions of gross adds, they tend to change quarter-to-quarter depending on where registrars are fulfilling demand, but again China has done well for us in the third quarter. Third quarter we saw EMEA do pretty well for us and Asia-Pacific was doing pretty well for us as well in the third quarter. Sterling Auty : Got it. Moving over to the negotiation with ICANN, I think there is a number of investors that just felt like, whoa why isn\u2019t this just a slam-dunk quick put in item 35 and you're done? You know, I think from some of the comments that you've made in the earnings calls, it does seem to be more of a negotiation and negotiation usually means both sides want something. There has been some question that I get from investors as to whether the ICANN fee would go up or what other elements we might actually see? Is there any just high-level color that you can give even prior to seeing the public comment documents? James Bidzos : So your question is specifically about when in terms of the publication for public comment? I'm not sure, you kind of lost me right at the end there. Sterling Auty : Nope, so the\u2026 James Bidzos : I guess that's exactly what the question is. Sterling Auty : Yep, to be very specific, the question is, plans of negotiation should we expect that not only would we see changes to pricing coming into the Registry Agreement from the item 35 will there be other changes to the Registry Agreement since it is a negotiation? James Bidzos : Well there is -- so I think, no I said that we can't provide any details, but I can reiterate and tell you that is an obligation to move the changes from the Cooperative Agreement which is the pricing, and we are satisfied with that process, and that is the amendment 35 pricing. There is also an obligation resulting from the 2016 extension to provide the security and stability. So I can tell you that in that process we're satisfied as well with that process, with the discussions that we have had, including security and stability. And in that process any obligations or expenses that arise from it, that's also an area where we're satisfied with the progress and also the amendment 35 pricing obviously. So hopefully that answers your question. Sterling Auty : Yes, that makes sense. Thank you, Jim. And then last question, George just back you know as we think about the new guidance for the 3.2% to 3.7% growth in the domain overall, should we think that this would be a continuation of the trend in the renewal rate that gets us to that level for the full-year or is there any other factors that kind of weigh on it? George Kilguss : Oh I mean, Sterling as normal there is seasonality we have in the fourth quarter i.e. there are quite a few holidays in the fourth quarter in the U.S. and abroad, and so it's obviously a combination of adds and renewal rates, but our guidance fully reflects our expectations for the full-year performance. Sterling Auty : Thank you, guys. Operator : We will take our last question from Nick Jones with Citi. Nicolas Jones : Hi, thank you for taking my question. I guess thinking a little bit longer term, is there any discernible differences in kind of the number of people who are parking domains today than maybe were during the last recession and is there kind of any difference in the business today or are the profiles registrant set that you could add some color around that are different today? James Bidzos : I think that's a very tough question to get into any specifics on, but generally I can tell you that this business has shifted steadily over the years. I mean you probably remember a few years ago when Google was making changes to its search algorithm that affected the way that people monetized domains, that affected registrar buying habits. Geography can play a role as well. People buy domains for different purposes and different geographies. So it's -- there are many purposes obviously from branding yourself and building businesses. People buy domains for defensive registration purposes. There are lots of different reasons they buy them, they vary over time, other external factors that influence them, geographies, so it's kind of hard to generalize. I can't think of any standout change or shift that I can point to that indicates any specific change or aspect of our business. As George said, this was a record Q3 with 9.9 million gross adds and so demand is good for the product, whatever the mix maybe, that's a subject for publication of some date in the future we might look at that. That's a good question, but it's really hard to sort of give you a detailed sort of granular answer to that. There is just so much activity and so many different reasons that people buy domains, and so many different types of monetization as well. George Kilguss : Yes, and as a reminder Nick, we are thick registry, so we really, excuse me, a thin registry, so we don't see the registrars that provide that. James Bidzos : We don\u2019t see the registrars that provide that, so we don\u2019t have quite as much information, but we certainly study these trends. And as I said there are diverse set of reasons that people buy domains. Nicolas Jones : I got to appreciate it. One more, but it's kind of been the upcoming political cycle and the growing scrutiny on kind of big tack, is there any kind of increased regulatory risk that VeriSign you guys trying to implement amendment 35 as we get into 2020 or how should we think about that? James Bidzos : We've read what you read about that, that's all we know. I haven\u2019t read anything lately. We've read what you've read. Nicolas Jones : Okay, well I appreciate taking my questions. James Bidzos : Sure. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please go to the investor relations department with any followup questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. With me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; Todd Strubbe, Executive Vice President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations Web site, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to our earnings release and slide presentation as applicable, each of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Bidzos : Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to report another solid quarter for VeriSign that caps off not only a solid year but also a strong decade in which we\u2019ve focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and returned value to our shareholders. In 2019, we marked more than 22 years of uninterrupted availability for the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 2019 was also a strong year for the .com and .net domain name base as we processed a record 40.3 million registrations and concluded the year with 158.8 million names. Finally, 2019 was characterized by solid financial performance with revenues of 1,232 million and free cash flow of 714 million. On January 3, VeriSign and ICANN announced a proposed agreement to amend the .com registry agreement and the new proposed framework for working together on initiatives related to the security, stability and resiliency of the domain name system in the form of a binding Letter of Intent between the two organizations. Together, these agreements fulfill commitments that ICANN and VeriSign made in 2016 when the .com registry agreement was previously amended. The new proposed amendment updates the .com registry agreement to reflect certain changes under amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes. According to the terms of the proposed Letter of Intent, VeriSign will have a one-time commitment to provide $4 million per year over five years beginning on January 1, 2021 for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community. ICANN's public comment period for these two documents closes February 14. The steps that follow the comment periods closing according to ICANN's Web site are that ICANN staff will prepare a report of the public comments by March 6, 2020 and then ICANN will submit the report to its Board of Directors. Now I\u2019ll discuss fourth quarter operational highlights. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 158.8 million consisting of 145.4 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.9%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.3 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.3% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 72.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Looking forward to 2020, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4%. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of common stock for 195 million. During the full year 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for 738 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately 743 million to a total of 1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial position remains strong with 1,218 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Lastly, regarding .web, as we mentioned last quarter, a hearing on VeriSign and NBC's request to participate in the arbitration process was held last year. We expect a ruling on our request in 2019, but we have been told by the panel that it now hopes to issue its ruling this month. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the company generated revenue of 1,242 million, up 1.4% from 2018 and delivered GAAP operating income of 806 million, up 5% from 767 million a year ago. As a reminder, revenue growth during 2019 was partially offset by lower revenue from our divested security services business as most customers\u2019 contracts transition to the buyer during the year. For the full year 2019, revenue from U.S. customers was 63% of total with 37% coming from foreign customers. Fourth quarter revenue came to 311 million, up 1% year-over-year. GAAP operating expense totaled 112 million compared to 103 million last quarter and 113 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased investment in our business, including increased sales and marketing programs as well as investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities. Fourth quarter operating income totaled 199 million compared with 194 million in the same quarter of 2018. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9% compared to 63.1% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled 148 million compared to 182 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.26 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $1.50 for the same quarter last year. For the year-over-year competitive results, remember that 2018 results included the gain on the sale of our security services business which increased fourth quarter 2018 GAAP net income by 52 million and earnings per share by $0.43. Related to non-GAAP results, fourth quarter 2019 non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes 12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million and was higher sequentially for the reasons I discussed earlier and slightly lower than fourth quarter 2018 levels. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 67.9%. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was 154 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.31. Finally, the full year 2019 non-GAAP operating margin was 69.6%. As a reminder, beginning with the first quarter of 2020 results, we will no longer be presenting nor discussing non-GAAP metrics with the exception of free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. As of December 31, 2019, the company maintained total assets of 1,854 million and total liabilities of 3,344 million. Assets included 1,218 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was 194 million and free cash flow was 185 million compared with 219 million and 211 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. The year-over-year difference was primarily related to higher cash taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a lower working capital benefit. I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance, which is now based solely on GAAP metrics. Revenue is expected to be in the range of 1,250 million to 1,265 million. This revenue range forecast reflects a growth rate slightly below the expected domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 4% as 2020 revenue no longer reflects any residual revenue on the security services business, which in 2019 was about $10 million. GAAP operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental investment in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities during 2020. Interest expense and non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between 68 million and 75 million. This range reflects both lower non-operating income from the transition services agreement which will cease during the first quarter and lower expected interest income on cash balances. Capital expenditures are expected to be between 45 million and 55 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 18% and 21%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2020 to also be within the same range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during 2019 and we look forward to continuing strong execution in 2020. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. The fourth quarter was another solid quarter for VeriSign capping a solid year for the company as further expansion of the domain name base and year-over-year revenue growth we generated and efficiently returned value to shareholders. We continue our work to protect, grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. We will now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question today from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Good afternoon, gentlemen, and thank you for taking my questions. A question for you, George, just on the full year guidance, just curious if you could help us understand what might be in there in terms of \u2013 I guess we\u2019re expecting price increases to roll in starting later this year and if that\u2019s been factored in? And additionally on .web, I know it\u2019s tough to know exactly when that closes, but expecting that it would in '20 obviously less meaningful, but just curious whether those were included in the guide? And then I just had a quick follow up. Thanks. George Kilguss : Rob, we don\u2019t guide the price increases but I can tell you in our guidance there are no price increases in the guidance. James Bidzos : And there\u2019s no \u2013 none of the guidance that you\u2019ve been given includes any revenue from .web at this point. Rob Oliver : Okay, great; very helpful. And then just as a follow up, I know you also mentioned in your prepared remarks increasing sales and marketing and just was wondering if \u2013 and domain growth obviously was strong \u2013 coming in stronger than expected. Just wondering if that\u2019s just kind of normal channel incentive activity or if there\u2019s anything else structural going on in terms of driving increased sales and marketing and potential increase spend going forward? Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. George Kilguss : Rob, so from a marketing perspective, I would say in general the programs and types of programs that we ran this year were similar to last year. So there\u2019s really not a huge change. What we\u2019re doing again, if we recall last year, we also had some seasonal increase in sales and marketing in the fourth quarter and we articulated that in our 10-Q that we filed last quarter that we expected that to go up as a percent of sales as well. Rob Oliver : Great. Thanks, again. Operator : Next we\u2019ll hear from Nick Jones with Citi. Nicolas Jones : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I guess, is there anything noteworthy as far as geographic mix goes? I know China has had an impact on renewal rates given kind of the coronavirus issue there. Is that creating any challenges with registrations in that region? George Kilguss : I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch the second part of the question. Nicolas Jones : Just wondering if kind of healthcare issues in China is having an impact on registrations or renewals? George Kilguss : Okay. So, yes, in the fourth quarter \u2013 we had a very strong fourth quarter as Jim alluded to, 10.3 million new additions which was up from 9.5 million in the fourth quarter of '18. When we look at where that demand came from, it came from registrars based in the United States, Asia Pacific region and EMEA. So as far as renewal rates, again, they vary by geography. It\u2019s something we keep an eye on. But as it relates to any virus over in China, we\u2019re not seeing any impact to date but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll keep an eye on. Nicolas Jones : Got it. And then one more. The investment with ICANN, can you provide a little more color around kind of what needs improvement in preservation? Is it mostly ongoing CapEx or is there anything kind of bigger that you can call out? James Bidzos : So the question, Nick, that was about spend on the infrastructure. Was that the question? Nicolas Jones : Yes, the 4 million per year over five years. George Kilguss : I\u2019m sorry. Can you just -- James Bidzos : The question about the Letter of Intent, the 4 million over five years. Nicolas Jones : I\u2019m just looking for a little more color on what exactly the money is going to be going towards and what needs to be improved, what needs to be preserved, is there any kind of additional color you can provide there? James Bidzos : It\u2019s security and stability for both DNS and for the Internet. There\u2019s a broad variety of areas where that funding will go. There\u2019s things such as root governance which impacts everybody, every relying party on the global Internet. ICANN\u2019s core mission is security and stability and that\u2019s where this funding is going. You may have followed last year, for example, ICANN executed on something called the KSK rollover refreshing the critical part of the global security system for the Internet, there\u2019s a broad variety of areas that need additional funding that everybody, including VeriSign, of the entire global Internet community will benefit from. And so the funding in the LOI is specifically targeted in that broad security, stability and resiliency area in ICANN core mission. Nicolas Jones : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : We will take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi, guys. I got a couple of questions. First one to revisit the renewal rate, I know you mentioned that renewal rate varies by geography. But given that it was down year-on-year, any more color that you can give? Is it just mix driven where the renewal rates in each of the geographies consistent with last year, or did you see any changes in any of the renewal rates in those geographies? George Kilguss : Sterling, as you know, renewal rates [indiscernible] period-to-period, but I think from a big picture perspective as we articulated last quarter, it really is \u2013 it seems to be a mixture of the names that we sold in the prior year coming up for renewal. We had more names being sold last year in the Asia Pacific and China region becoming a slightly large proportion of the base. And so they are having a slight impact there. But other than that, we\u2019re not seeing huge variances. Again, I would just remind you if you look back over the last couple of years, the company\u2019s renewal rate has been around 72% and has recently increased up into the 74% range. And while it is down year-over-year by about 60 basis points, it\u2019s still in general improving as the base ages. So I would say remind folks that we had a pretty stable renewal rate within the company. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then following up on the 10.3 million gross additions, you basically said there is growth out of U.S., Asia Pacific and EMEA. But can you peel that back a little bit more? So 10.3 is better than what we have been seeing. I think it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve done over 10 million in quite some time. Which area contributed more than what you have been seeing? In other words, which geography generated incremental growth this quarter? George Kilguss : Well, as I said, those three were the largest contributors to the growth. Again, recall we\u2019re a FIN registry, so what we\u2019re reporting on is the registrations by our registrars where they are domicile to do business. So to some degree it may not be completely transparent to where the end users are. The registrars have that information not necessarily us. But our customers and registrars in the fourth quarter, the U.S. continued to remain strong as did Asia Pacific and EMEA. The only thing I\u2019d just comment on is also what happens sometimes from year-to-year is we have new companies becoming registrars and they tend to pop up in new markets, and we have sometimes consolidation in the market where one registrar may acquire some business from another registrar. But those three regions performed well for us in the quarter. Sterling Auty : Okay, got it. And I want to clarify. Jim, you mentioned in terms of the panel decision on .web, that\u2019s just the final decision as to whether you can be a party to the process or what is that decision that you\u2019re waiting for this month on? James Bidzos : Yes, Sterling, that\u2019s the issue before the panel. They indicated that they could rule before the end of the year, but that didn\u2019t happen. The indication now is that they hope to rule this month. But the issue before them that they will be ruling on is the active participation by VeriSign in this process. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then back \u2013 operationally you mentioned the investments that you were making both in sales and marketing as well as some infrastructure investments. Can you kind of parse out where was the bigger portion of that investment, in which of those two areas? James Bidzos : We\u2019re not prepared to talk about that level of detail. There are a lot of different components to the security infrastructure investments. As you know, Sterling, we\u2019re very different than most other registries. Many of them are actually marketing registries rather than operating registries. We operate the common net infrastructure which requires stringent performance requirements. So we make investments that are I think far beyond what most others do. There are a lot of schedule investments that we make, but as you know the cyber security threat environment is dynamic and ever changing. If there are new threats, if there are new technologies, new products that strengthen our infrastructure and our core mission, we\u2019re not going to hesitate to make those investments. We have all of the above in the quarter along with sales and marketing. But we haven\u2019t and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared now to break that out in any detail. Sterling Auty : All right. Last question is one of the questions I get frequently from investors is what your appetite and what your view would be on acquisitions and being a consolidator in the market especially now that you\u2019ve got the ability to be a vertically integrated company outside of .com? What\u2019s your interest level in pursuing those opportunities? James Bidzos : I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any update we can provide you. There\u2019s certainly no guidance for a particular interest. As you know, our focus is on .com and .net. We\u2019ve actually made divestments in our VSS business. We are pursuing .web as a growth opportunity. We do have additional IDNs that we expect to deploy in the future. I think security and stability in our current growth plans that we\u2019ve talked about are what we\u2019re prepared to talk about. There\u2019s not anything else that I would speculate about or guide to. I would just say that as you heard George and myself comment earlier, the guidance that we\u2019ve given for 2020 does not include any provision for price increases, doesn\u2019t include any revenue from .web. So we tend to be more conservative in those areas and that\u2019s probably as much as I can tell you at this time. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you. Operator : That will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley for any additional closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, Operator. Welcome to VeriSign's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Thank you to everyone for joining our call today, and we hope each of you are staying safe and healthy. Joining me remotely from their respective locations are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. Thank you in advance for your patience if we experience any interference, delays or sound quality issues during today's call. This call and presentation are being webcast from the investor relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our first quarter 2020 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site. And within a few hours, a replay of the call will be posted.  Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that would cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. VeriSign retains its long-standing policy not to comment on financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure.  The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and 2 non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which will be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. As people work to address the global challenges posed by COVID-19, we are focused on protecting our people, managing our operations, supporting our local communities and helping small businesses through our general partners. While the issues posed by COVID-19 are unprecedented, they fall within our standard preparation for disruption caused by local, regional and global events. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19.  Additionally, to help our local communities, as announced in March, we made an initial $2 million donation during the first quarter to first responders and medical personnel in the Northern Virginia area, the United Way's Worldwide COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery Fund and Semper Fi & America's Fund. Additional efforts to protect our people, manage our operations, help communities and help small business through our channel partners can be found in our company blog, which is available at verisign.com. Now I'd like to address updates and first quarter results. I'm able to report another solid quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered consistent financial results.  On March 27, we announced that VeriSign and ICANN entered into the third amendment to the .com registry agreement and a separate binding letter of intent, which formalized a new framework for ICANN and VeriSign to work together on initiatives related to the security ability and resiliency in the domain system. We are pleased with the outcome of the process and remain confident that these agreements will serve the public interest by providing pricing certainty and by helping to hold the security, stability and resiliency in .com and the critical Internet functions it supports globally.  In addition, we announced that in light of the global disruption caused by COVID-19, we have registry fees for all TLDs, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020. As we stated last quarter, regarding the letter of intent, one-time commitment to provide $4 million per year over 5 years beginning on January 1, 2021, for ICANN to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. We believe that the activities funded by this commitment will benefit the entire Internet community.  Also, as an update, in February, Todd Strubbe was promoted from Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer to President and Chief Operating Officer, further strengthening our senior management team.  Relating to first quarter operational highlights. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 160.7 million consisting of 147.3 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the first quarter, we processed 10 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.83 million names. Although our renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2020 will be approximately 75.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.0% achieved in the first quarter of 2019 and 73.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  By the way, our press release that we just released this afternoon has a typo. And in the sentence that I just read, in the press release, it says in the fourth quarter of 2020 instead of the fourth quarter of 2019 when it mentions the 73.8% renewal rate. So the fourth -- the first quarter -- sorry, the fourth quarter of 2019 renewal rate was 73.8%. And the typo, it says fourth quarter of 2020. That's getting ahead of yourself, I suppose. So I just wanted to point out that typo.  So back to the business. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75%. Recognizing the uncertainty presented by COVID-19, this updated range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the balance of the year.  During the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 1.3 million shares of common stock repurchased for $245 million. At March 31, 2020, $826 million remain available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains strong with $1.139 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $313 million, up 2% from the same quarter in 2019, and delivered operating income of $206 million, up 3% from $200 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $106 million, flat with the first quarter a year ago and lower from $112 million last quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expense is primarily a result of a decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter, partially offset by the $2 million in donations that Jim mentioned earlier.  The operating margin in the quarter came to 66% compared to 65.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $334 million compared to $163 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.86 in the first quarter this year compared to $1.35 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the quarter included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits. This income tax benefit increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. As of March 31, 2020, the company maintained total assets of $1.754 billion and total liabilities of $3.163 billion. Assets included $1.139 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $180 million, and free cash flow was $169 million compared with $187 million and $178 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year.  I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is still expected to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate of between 2% and 3.75% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin, which includes stock-based compensation, is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, security capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020.  Interest expense and nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $80 million and $85 million. This updated range reflects lower expected interest income on cash balances due to decreased interest rates. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5%, which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we expect tax expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% and 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 will not be impacted by the remeasurement of our accrual for uncertain tax positions discussed earlier and are expected to still be in the range of 18% to 21% of pretax income.  In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the balance of 2020 during this period of market uncertainty. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. Before moving to the question-and-portion of this call, I would like to acknowledge and efforts of critical staff, not only here at VeriSign but everwhere, of the hard work and commitment they are demonstrating during this crisis. We appreciate the training, skill and dedicated effort of our team, which remains focused on operating our critical infrastructure. I hope everyone remains well and continues to stay safe. Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, we would like to walk through a few questions which we know are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. The first question I'll ask and then answer is, could you provide more information then on COVID-19's impacts to your business in terms of your infrastructure, supply chain, customers, demand for .com and .net and capital allocation? The answer is that we recognize that VeriSign operates critically within that infrastructure that's relied on now more than ever. Protecting unconditionally the infrastructure that operates registry services for.com and net as well as our root operations remains job one. The company's readiness plans, which are routinely exercised, include the ability to maintain critical Internet infrastructure with most employees working remotely. VeriSign maintains multiple redundant operation centers as well as hundreds of service locations distributed worldwide across 6 continents. VeriSign's diverse DNS infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location, and VeriSign technical teams across the globe are able to perform key functions from multiple locations. We are prepared to continue to operate all of our services, including registry services for .com and .net and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance governed by ICANN even in the demanding environment created by COVID-19.  In respect to our supply chain, we're monitoring these issues and are taking action where appropriate to ensure that we continue to have everything necessary for the ongoing operation of our infrastructure. It is important to remember that our infrastructure is not dependent on a single type of technology, vendor or power source at a given location. With regards to our customers, these are clearly uncertain times for businesses and the economy. As we discussed in our blog post, we're taking actions to help small business through our channel partners. In order to support individuals and small businesses affected by this crisis, VeriSign is freezing registry prices for all of our TLDs, including common net, through the end of 2020. In addition, from April 2 until June 1, VeriSign is waiving what is known as the restore fee for .com and .net domain names. Typically, when a domain name registration is deleted by a registrar, there is a period of time during which the person who registered the name can pay a one-time restore fee to get it back before the name goes back into general availability. This helps protect registrants who may have left their domain names lapse accidentally at an inopportune time. As it relates to demand for .com and .net domain names, you see in today's results that we saw a good demand for new registrations during the first quarter as well as an improved preliminary renewal rate. That being said, as I stated earlier, recognizing the uncertainty over the duration and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, the updated guidance range reflects a more cautious view of domain name base growth for the rest of the year. As a reminder, you can track the performance of the domain name base with daily updates on our website.  Finally, regarding capital allocation, recognizing that these are unprecedented times, and that is a period of market uncertainty for at least the next quarter, our capital return will be more in line with historical amounts.  Second question I'll ask and address. With amendment 3 finalized, when can you take price increases for .com? Amendment 3 for the COM Registry Agreement reflects certain changes agreed to under Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, including the pricing changes, which allow limited .com price increases in each of the last 4 years of every 6-year period. The first period began on October 26, 2018. Therefore, October 26, 2020, was the earliest date that VeriSign could have taken a price increase. That said, as we announced in March, VeriSign is freezing its registry prices for all of our top-level domains, including .com and .net, through the end of 2020 in order to support individuals and small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, as a reminder, the com and net registry agreements require VeriSign to provide 6 months' notice of any price increase.  Now the third and last question I'd like to answer before we take yours. Are there any updates on the stats of .web? As mentioned on our last call, we were awaiting a ruling on whether VeriSign could participate in the arbitration called an independent review process under ICANN's rules. As announced in our 10-K in February, the arbitration panel permitted VeriSign and new .co to participate in aspects of the independent review process. We do not have further updates at this time. Now we'll open the call for your questions. As a reminder, due to the remote nature of participants, we will do our best to respond to each question, and we appreciate your patience if we experience technical issues. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question today from Rob Oliver with Baird. Robert Oliver : Great. And, Todd, congratulations on your promotion. Jim, you guys are already a model of efficiency, but, yes, answering your own questions takes it to a new level. You've taken most of mine, but I did want to just flush out the strong renewal rates, which were very strong, and maybe get a bit more color on what you guys are seeing in terms of domain activity. I mean, the slight tweak down of the revised range is fairly modest. And just curious what you guys are seeing and how that plays into your forecasting about any residual effects on SMBs from COVID-19? James Bidzos : This is Jim. I'll ask George to answer the substance of your question. I would just say beforehand that there's obvious significant economic impact from COVID-19. And we're talking about Q1 here, but, obviously, this is going to last more than 1 quarter. So I would just say, again, for clarity that our more cautious view because of this crisis is reflected in all of our guidance. But George, let me have you answer the question, if you would. George Kilguss : Sure. Rob, it's George. From a renewal rate perspective, we did see renewal rates tick up a little bit from year ago levels. When we take a deeper look, we see the previously renewed rate really being the driver of that. So we're seeing people who have renewed names previously continue to hold on to those names. And as we talked about before, that's a normal function that we've seen previously as the base stages. As we look at the domain name base performance itself, clearly here in the first quarter, as Jim mentioned, we had what actually was a good Q1. New units were up 2.1% from a year ago and delivered $1.8 million. As you mentioned, we're keeping an eye on the domain name base and demand for the rest of the year. In the quarter, we saw good strength from the United States registrars. And I would say the China market was a little softer, but the strength from the U.S. registrars really outpaced that and overcompensated for that, helping the domain name base to continue to grow here in Q1. Operator : Our next question will come from Nick Jones with Citi. Nicholas Jones : Just two quick ones, one on the .com pricing agreement. I guess, just one on the timing without, I guess, asking for specific timing. But as you aren't taking any pricing increases in 2020, are you able to tick the October 26, say, in early 2021? And if you were to take it in 2021, the way the contract reads, are you then not able to take the October 26, 2021? Ultimately, could you do 2 prices -- 2 increases in the same year? I'm not sure if you follow me, but that's my first one. And then I have a quick follow-up. James Bidzos : Okay. Well, I think the best way I can answer your question. First of all, let me just say that your question is actually sort of getting to a process that we employ. So rather than try to interpret that on the fly, let me just give you some facts about that. Under Amendment 3 that, I think, will be helpful to answer your question, under Amendment 3 to the COM agreement, VeriSign `is allowed to take a price increase in each of the last 4 years of every 6-year period of up to 7% over the maximum price in the preceding pricing year. Pricing year is defined as October 26 to October 25. This time frame is consistent with Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement that established the start of the 6-year period as of October 26, 2018. So those are the sort of the facts of the mechanics, and I think that should help you kind of get to where you want me to. Nicholas Jones : That does. That's helpful. That's helpful. And then the second one, just quickly on kind of new top level domain, a large registrar acquired a registry that issues new TLDs and some country code TLDs. Does that potentially increase the risk of impacting .com demand? Or is there -- do you have any thoughts around that? James Bidzos : So I assume you're referring to GoDaddy's acquisition of NeuStar. So let me just say GoDaddy has been and is an important channel partner for us, and we expect that to continue. End users continue to see tremendous value in the common net top level domains, and we know that all of our channel partners recognize that value as well. So also, it's important to note that vertical integration is not new. Several of our registrar channel partners also operate TLD registries, including Google, which has Google Registry and Name.com, which is a registrar that owns Donuts, which is a large registry. In each case, these registrars continue to be important channel partners for VeriSign. Operator : We'll take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : George, maybe to start with you. If I look at the revenue results in the quarter, it's stronger than I would have anticipated based on the 1.8 million net names added. So can you comment? Was there something to either the seasonality of those net additions that helped revenue? Or was there any other one-time revenue or non-domain-related revenue that maybe helped the quarter? George Kilguss : There was no non-domain name revenue that was material that we didn't have present in the fourth quarter. I think what may be impacting your perception is we had a very, very strong fourth quarter. And so we had quite a few domains come in the fourth quarter, and that's just waterfalling here into the first quarter and helping us getting a little bit of a tailwind here in Q1. Sterling Auty : Okay, great. And then on the GoDaddy acquisition of NeuStar, I'd like to look at it this way. Does this change or influence what you might think about doing with. Web and vertical integration or perhaps in terms of future consolidation of registries? James Bidzos : I really -- I don't see that it really has any impact on any thinking about that. As I said, this is not the first time that a registrar has become a registry. There are several of them out there, and those relationships work fine. But I think there's no update on .web, so it's early to speculate about .web per se. But at this point, no real comment to say about that. I mean, we've certainly discussed the ability to be vertically integrated, but let me just say Amendment 35 to the cooperative agreement clarified that the vertical integration within the com registry was only meant to apply to com. So we can't be vertically integrated for com. That clarification is now included in Amendment 3 to the COM Registry Agreement. And the net registry agreement doesn't have a similar clarification. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then on .web, you mentioned what update you did have. Is COVID-19 delaying the process? Or any other color you could provide would be helpful. James Bidzos : I don't believe it has. The proceedings in this arbitration are -- actually have even preceding the COVID-19 crisis, even the appearance of COVID-19 have always been telephonic. And so it's unlike appearances in court where people need to show up and physically be there. I believe there is an upcoming hearing later this year that is at least planned to be in person, but I can't speculate about what would happen there. But everything that's gone on thus far has been telephonic. So thus far, there's been no slowdown. Beyond that, I can't speculate about what will happen. Sterling Auty : So you mentioned that there is an in-person one later this year. So does that kind of give us an indication that there would not be a resolution to .web, let's say, over the next quarter or so? James Bidzos : I can't speculate about exactly what will happen when. I just know that there was a hearing that was at least planned to be an in-person hearing. I don't know if that's subject change or not. I'm not familiar with that level of detail with the rules, the flexibility or the plans or what impact the COVID-19 crisis may have on that particular plan. I just know that things have proceeded so far because, again, all of the proceedings of literally everyone has been telephonic. Sterling Auty : Got it. And last question. You talked about the supply chains. What does the capacity utilization in the VeriSign network look like today? Do you have ample overhead to handle some of the spikes that we're seeing. Some of the traffic data coming out of Akamai and others showed some pretty significant Internet usage. How is the resiliency from just the performance in capacity utilization within the VeriSign network? James Bidzos : We are very pleased with the performance of our network under increased traffic loads. It's designed with considerable excess capacity. And as I stated earlier, we are -- we planned for situations like this, which certainly, the -- not just from the work-from-home environment perspective, but also from an increased traffic capacity. Excess capacity to deal with traffic loads has always been a design criteria in our network, and we're accommodating traffic without issues. Operator : That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. With the increased demand for and reliance on internet services during the COVID-19 crises, securing reliable operation of our infrastructure becomes even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical infrastructure. We have been and are prepared to continue operating all of our services including registry services for dotcom and dotnet and our route operations at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by ICANN with more of our employees continuing to work remotely. Our focus on mission is emphasized by the fact that the company last week marked 23 years of 100% availability of the dotcom and dotnet domain name resolution system. This achievement is the result of the dedication and expertise of our team and our specialized infrastructure. Also as part of our response to the COVID-19 crisis, we announced in March a freeze of the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs including dotcom through the end of 2020. Today given the current environment we're further extending that price raise for the wholesale prices in all of our TLDs through March 31, 2021. Additionally, we're also extending the waiver of the wholesale restore fee for expired domain names through the end of 2020. Now I'll address our quarterly results. Q2 of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. Regarding second quarter operational highlights, at the end of June the domain name base in dotcom and dotnet totaled $162.1 million consisting of 148.7 million names for dotcom and 13.4 million names for dotnet with a year-over-year growth rate of 3.8%. During the second quarter we processed 11.1 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.41 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2020 will be approximately 72.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 74.2% achieved in the second quarter of 2019 and 75.4 last quarter. For 2020, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 2.75% and 4%. This updated range which recognizes the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19 reflects the strength we've seen in new registrations and our expectation for domain name base growth for the balance of the year. During the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 730,000 shares of common stock repurchased for $150 million. At June 30, 2020, $676 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash including potential share repurchases. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks Jim and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the company generated revenue of $314 million up 2.6% from the same quarter in 2019 and delivered operating income $207 million up 2.5% from $202 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $108 million up from $105 million in the second quarter a year ago and up from $106 million last quarter. The sequential increase in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing spend during the quarter. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65.8% compared to 65.9% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $152 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.32 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.24 for the same quarter last year. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $215 million and free cash flow was $204 million compared with $165 million and $154 million respectively in the second quarter last year. Operating cash flow in the second quarter benefited from lower cash tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $50 million in US federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. Additionally the deferred revenue balance increased during the quarter as a result of the strength in new registrations. I will now discuss full year 2020 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.255 billion to $1.265 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 2.75% and 4% as Jim mentioned earlier. Operating margin which includes stock-based compensation is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure, securing capabilities and sales and marketing expense during the remainder of 2020. Interest expense and non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $75 million and $80 million. This updated range reflects the additional $5 million gain recognized during the second quarter to the sale of our security services business. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million and $55 million. We still expect our full year effective tax rate to be a benefit of between 2% and 5% which reflects the $168 million income tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. For the balance of 2020, we still expect that expense as a percent of pretax income of between 19% to 22%. Cash taxes for 2020 are now expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pretax income. In summary, Verisign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in the second half of 2020. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thank you, George. I'd like to say again that our priorities are our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical and more businesses and individuals and network depend on internet infrastructure for their livelihood. Our record of dotcom and Verisign for their hard work in maintaining our uptime record even during the pandemic. Given that participants are dialing in remotely for this call, I'd like to walk through a few questions which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. The first question, with today's announced extension of the price freeze, how should we think about limited pricing flexibility you have for dotcom? First as a reminder, the wholesale price for dotcom domain names has been unchanged at $7.85 for eight years since 2012. Also as a reminder, our wholesale prices for dotcom are governed by our registry agreement with ICANN. The retain price that the end user actually pays for a domain name is set by the retail channel, which is the registrars who have no regulation of their pricing. Additionally, there's a unregulated secondary market for domain names. With that background, under amendment three to the dotcom registry agreement, Verisign is not permitted to raise the wholesale price of dotcom domain names by up to 7% in each of the final four years of every six year period. Within the current six year period, the first year in which we may increase the wholesale price ends on October 25, 2021 and we expect to effectuate a dotcom wholesale price increase before that October 21 date -- 2021 date. The second question, are there any updates on the status of dotweb? Answer, as we noted last quarter, a final hearing is currently scheduled to begin on August 03 in the Independent Review Process or IRP that affiliates initiated in November 2018. That hearing is scheduled to take place on videoconferencing. As a reminder Verisign is not a party in these IRP proceedings, but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also as a reminder an IRP under ICANN's bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN follow its own policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP the ICANN board will make the final decision on the delegation of the dotweb PLT. Question three, can you help me better understand what is impacting the increase in new registrations and the lower preliminary quarterly renewal rate for the second quarter? Most of the strength in new registrations came from registrars in North America. While we don't have the same visibility that retailers do, based on feedback from our retailers they are seeing increased demand from small businesses getting online. This strength was partially offset by slower activity from registrars in China. As it relates to the preliminary quarterly renewal rate, the year-over-year decrease is primarily related to the lower overall first time renewal rate. Year-over-year the overall previous renewal rate remained relatively consistent. Question four, are there any updates to the donations you announced earlier this year? Yes, there are. During the first quarter, we made an initial $2 million donation to organizations assisting those impacted by COVID-19 locally and nationally. During the second quarter, we made a cash contribution of $1 million to the Equal Justice initiative in support of their work. We are actively working on an expansion to our VeriSign Cares Program beyond the $3 million the company donated during the first half of the year again with a focus on providing assistance to those impacted during the COVID-19 crisis. I'm sure you have questions and I can only say that these additional efforts should be further along by the time we talk to you again next quarter. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator instructions] And we'll now take our first question from Robert Oliver with Baird. Robert Oliver : Great. Thank you guys for taking my question and thanks for all the color. So on if I can maybe try a little bit more remarkably the domain growth is back now above where it was pre-COVID at least lower end of the range, which is a pretty remarkable. You mentioned some of the drivers there you guys have strength, can you that a little bit more and then China weakness maybe being responsible for the lower renewal rate. Can we perhaps get a little bit more color on that above geographically as well as some of the economic puts and takes around SMBs and what you guys are seeing there and then I had one follow-up? Thanks. James Bidzos : Okay. Rob I think I simply can try first of all let me just say that basically the strength came from predominantly North America with small businesses getting online as the geography I think we have limited visibility, but let me invite George to comment further. George Kilguss : Yes thanks Jim and thanks for the question Rob. So as you mentioned in Q2 we basically strengthened gross additions on new registrations in North America and will say EMEA and APAC were also strongly. They also improved in the quarter year-over-year and China was a little bit lower. As far as the China gross ads they were similar to the gross ad levels we had last quarter there but they were down from year ago levels. As far as renewal rates, Jim mentioning they were down about 1.4% in total year-over-year and we saw that decline primarily manifests itself in lower first time renewal rates and they were down also in most markets that we track, keep an eye on. And as Jim also mentioned, we're a thin registry we talk to before. We don\u2019t have direct visibility into the end user. So it's a little more difficult for us to understand the economic impact per se, but in general gross ads were very strong this quarter. Our net ads were good. They were $1.4 million with two was slightly above the second quarter of 2019 only totaled $1.3 million. Robert Oliver : Okay. George, appreciate it and then just a follow-up and I think it makes a lot of sense on the suspension of the price increase given the pandemic and so I guess I would just ask if there's anything beyond the obvious in terms of the rationale there and then you do draw line in the sand that you guys will avail yourself of the price increase, which I believe would get you guys the four years of the final secure. I just want to make sure we understand that properly or if there anything else you can add to flush that out. Thanks again very much gentlemen. George Kilguss : Sure thanks Rob. I don\u2019t think I can meet that anything you summarized it accurately. We are taking another freeze of prices through March 31, 2021 that is related to the current environment via data the first year period of our available price increase is October 25, 2021 and you accurately stated that we expect to effectuate dotcom wholesale price increase before that date. I think we're ready for another question, operator. Operator : We'll move to Nic Jones with Citi. Nicholas Jones : The first one as you extend the waiver for retail fees, can you tell me what are the implications there? Is there kind of a building group of domain that are up that could potentially generate some money from these restore fees and maybe fall off, would you then recognize those as churn, I guess as you go walkthrough kind of the dynamic of the restore fee and provide a little bit color on is there any build out coming out and I've one follow-up after that? James Bidzos : Okay. Let me hand it to George to answer your question. George Kilguss : First off the impact of waiving the restore fees is immaterial to our financials and is accounted for in the revenue guidance we provided today. There is a period of time after our registrar deletes the domain name and still this is a redemption rates, it's a 30 day period and the registrar has a chance to get the name back then before those of the general availability. So those names are talking about. It's already been deleted by the registrar and so this restore fee is in addition to the standard registration renewal fee associated with the domain name renewal and we don\u2019t disclose our wholesale restore fee which is charged for the registrar and of course they determine what the actual retail restore fee is and we've seen many registrars pass on the waiver from a retail perspective. So anecdotally we believe that small businesses and individuals are benefitting from our waiver. Nicholas Jones : Got it. Thank you. And just one follow-up on operating margin with kind of the increased SMB interest in having a digital presence. Is there potential leverage in this sales and marketing bucket throughout the rest of the year as you don\u2019t need to advertise or be as aggressive in an OpEx one, thanks. George Kilguss : Thanks Nick. I mean clearly every quarter, we're looking at our expenses and making sure we're spending the appropriate amount in each of the categories to drive profitable growth in support of the business. Sales and marketing expense sequentially was up and we do have plans to continue marketing activities throughout the year, but those costs again are factored into the guidance that we provided, but we do expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing activity for the rest of 2020 year. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Couple of questions, so the new guidance for the domain growth for the full year, what have you factored in for the last two quarters in terms of the pace of new registrations and the renewal rate? James Bidzos : George? George Kilguss : So we don\u2019t guide to gross registrations or renewal rates. We guide to the net zone increase. Clearly we've done pretty well here through the first half of the year and we expect that continued demand for the product but as far as what will happen specifically to the renewal rate into a quarter, gross ads, we'll wait and see. We published the gross ads, the new information in the domain name base on the left side. You can see what is going on there, but our full year guidance is the guidance we provided on breaking out quarterly. Sterling Auty : So maybe just a follow-up and try it in a different way at least qualitatively, I think if we look at some of the previous economic cycles when we get to this point, we tend to see increased business closures and I think we saw that manifest itself in the renewal rate in the June quarter. Are you at least incorporating the idea of lower renewal rate in the back half and maybe a higher elevation in new registrations just qualitatively? George Kilguss : We forecast or model our results that way. We do a lot of algorithmic computations and models that have proven fairly active over the prior period and we use that algorithmic model to guide us not only through the quarters here but also in our planning. It's been very reliable for us and so that's the methodology that we're looking at. It's very hard to go down and forecast demand by and end user or by a registrar of by a country level. We clearly look at those results but the data is so voluminous that we have to use algorithms that do that and the algorithms which like I said before have been relatively accurate are giving us the range that we put out here for our guidance. Sterling Auty : That makes sense. Can you give us what the number of domain names up for renewal in the September quarter looks like and how does that compare against what you just had in June and what to really look like versus September a year ago? George Kilguss : So the number of names that were up for renewal in the second quarter 2020 was 35.1 million. We expect 34.2 to go up for renewal next quarter in the third quarter. When I go back a year ago in the second quarter of 2019 that was closer to 33.3 million and the third quarter of 2019 was 32.6 million. Sterling Auty : And then last one and I think I can guess the answer but I still want to ask it anyway because it's been a topic of a lot of investor conversations, you mentioned that you are going to take advantage of the price increase before the October deadline. We know you have the six-month window in terms of announcement, but based on the comments that you\u2019ve given are you leaving open the possibility that you might at least announce the price increase prior to that March timeframe that have extended the price freezes? George Kilguss : I am not entirely sure I understand your question, but I think maybe the answer can be determined by having a nearly state as you point out there is a six-month notice that's required to effectuate a price increase before we have to provide six months notice and obviously we will do that. The date of the expiration of the first year of the four price increases available in the six year period is October 25, 2021 and we of course prior to today's announcement are freezing wholesale prices in all of our TLDs through March 31, 2021. So I think a little bit of math could answer your question. Till that point somewhere right. Sterling Auty : And maybe just to sneak one last one in, Go Daddy's acquisition that you saw registry assets bring let's say a stronger financially sound company into the registry operations, how do you view their entrance into the registry state and how do you think that might influence consolidation of registries moving forward? George Kilguss : Well Go Daddy has been and is all it has been an important channel partner for us to obviously ever since probably back to when Bob Parsons started to build their company. We certainly expect that to continue. End users see tremendous value in dotcom and dotnet in those TLDs and we know that our channel partners recognize that value as well. I just should point out that vertical integration is not new. Several of other of our register channel partners also operate TLD registries. Google has Google Registry, name.com has donuts with over a 200 TLDs in it and each of those cases these registrars continue to be an important channel partner to Verisign for our TLDs. I expect those relationships to continue. Operator : That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. David for closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. Now at this time, I like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's third quarter 2020 earnings call. Thank you to everyone for joining our call today, and we hope each of you are staying safe and healthy. Joining me remotely from their respective locations are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our second quarter 2020 earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, a replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC specifically the most recent reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which will be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. In a moment, Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Today VeriSign reports 318 million in revenue for the quarter, up 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago. But before we dive deeper into our results, I wanted to speak just a bit about COVID-19 and how we're addressing it within VeriSign. With the increased demand for and reliance on internet services during the COVID-19 pandemic, securing reliable operation of our infrastructure has become even more important. Our focus remains on our mission, which is to ensure the availability of our critical internet infrastructure for the benefit of internet users. We continue to operate our registry services for .com and .net and our root operations, at the rigorous standards of performance and availability governed by our agreements with ICANN, while most of our employees continue to work remotely. Now, I'll address our quarterly results. The third quarter of 2020 was another consistent quarter for VeriSign, in which we focused on our core business, expanded the domain name base and delivered solid financial results. Regarding third quarter operational highlights, at the end of September, the domain name base and .com and .net totaled 163.7 million, consisting of 150.3 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. During the third quarter, we processed 10.9 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.65 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.4%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2019 and 72.8% last quarter. For 2020, we now expect the domain name base growth rate of between 3.5% and 4%. This updated range reflects the strength we have seen in new registrations and our expectations for domain name base growth for the remainder of the year, balanced with the ongoing uncertainty presented by COVID-19. During the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program that resulted in 823,000 shares of common stock repurchase for 170 million. At quarter-end, 506 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. Our financial and liquidity position remain stable with 1.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thank you, Jim and good afternoon everyone. As mentioned, for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 the company generated revenue of 318 million, up 3.1% year-over-year, and delivered operating income of 207 million, compared with 206 million in the same quarter a year ago.  Operating expenses totaled 111 million, up from 103 million in the third quarter a year ago, and up from 108 million last quarter. The increase in operating expense reflects our continued investments throughout the year in personnel to support our cyber security and infrastructure initiatives among other factors. The operating margin in the quarter came to 65%, compared to 66.7% in the same quarter a year ago, and 65.8% last quarter. Net income totaled 171 million, compared to 154 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.49 in the third quarter this year, compared to $1.30 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter included a previously unrecognized income tax benefit of 24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21 and resulted from the re-measurement of Verizon\u2019s accrual for uncertain tax divisions. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was 140 million, and free cash flow was 125 million, compared with 208 million and 197 million respectively for the third quarter last year. Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the third quarter were both lower, mainly due to the permitted deferral of 52 million in U.S. federal tax payments until the third quarter, which we mentioned in our last quarter\u2019s call. I will now discuss updated full-year 2020 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of 1.262 billion to 1.267 billion. This revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth of between 3.5% and 4% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin, which includes stock based compensation, is now expected to be between 64.75% and 65.25%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investments in our operational infrastructure and security capabilities, as well as sales and marketing expenses during the fourth quarter of 2020. Interest expense and non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $75 million and $80 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million and $50 million. We now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be a net benefit of between 6% and 9%, which reflects the 168 million and 24 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits recorded in the first quarter and the third quarter, respectively. Cash taxes for 2020 are still expected to be in the range of 18% to 20% of pre-tax income. In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution for the remainder of 2020. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim, for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. I'd like to say again that our priorities continue to be our mission of ensuring the availability of our critical infrastructure and the safety of our people. Internet usage has increased during the pandemic and reliance on online services even more so. For many people who are working from home and isolating at home, online services are critical, and more businesses and individuals than ever depend on internet infrastructure for their livelihood. I'd like to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work and maintaining our critical internet infrastructure, even during the pandemic. We'd like to walk through two questions which we believe are on your mind before we open the call for your additional questions. First question, are there any updates regarding your plans to use the limited pricing flexibility you have for .com? No updates from what we said last quarter. We still expect to effectuate the .com wholesale price increase before October 25, 2021 and the prices for all of our TLDs are frozen through March 31, 2021. Second question, are there any updates on the status of .web? As we noted last quarter, a final hearing was scheduled in August. The hearing took place in early August. The participants, including VeriSign then submitted their post hearing briefs. A final decision from the panel may be issued later this year or early next year. As a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings, but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects.  Also, as a reminder, in IRP under ICANN bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation at the .web TLD. And now, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead, sir. Rob Oliver : Great, thank you very much. Thank you guys for taking my questions. Appreciate it. Jim, just to start with you. You know, just overall, I'd love to get your thoughts on the domain environment, you know, clearly coming out of COVID a lot of concerns about small business, small business failure. And you guys have, you know, consistently from that time when you took down the guide on domain growth have kind of ratcheted it back up and [came in] for this quarter, pretty impressive. So, I just was wondering if you could maybe step back and talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the environment. You know, a lot of new business starts. And it would seem that that would be offsetting some of the kind of macro concerns that you know, that they may be weighing on small businesses, or maybe they're holding on to their websites. We'd love to hear your thoughts there. And then I have a quick follow up. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Okay, thanks for the question. Well, I'll make a comment or two and then I'd like to invite George and Todd to comment as they see that market having developed over the crisis. I'll just say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, obviously, people are making greater use of the internet for a wide variety of reasons for their livelihood or in the pursuit of a livelihood. And starting new businesses, others may not be faring as well, there are a lot of complex reasons that people register, keep, and delete domain names. And there's a complex sort of analysis that leads to where the increased growth resulted in the quarter. Overall, the numbers speak for themselves and that it was a solid quarter of additional growth. There's clearly additional internet usage. There's clearly additional growth in the domain name space as a result of that. And it's quite clear as you see in our results, and as you observed. And George, Todd [indiscernible] comment if you'd like. George Kilguss : Sure. This is George Kilguss. So, as Jim mentioned, we had a good quarter, new registrations were 10.9 million, which was up about 980,000 new names from a year ago, but very similar to last quarter. And the trends that we're seeing here in Q3 are very similar to last quarter. In that we saw strength in registrations from North American registrar's and media registrars, and APAC registrars. New units from China based registrar's during the quarter was similar to Q2 level However, they were down year-over-year. But overall, a very solid quarter continuing to see good demand here in the third quarter, and I think as Jim said, those are just secular trends that we're seeing with people seeing the value in the utility of having a website and getting a domain name to better service their customers and maximize their e-commerce objectives.  And I think we're helping to support that \u2013 those small businesses in doing that and those trends, at least so far this year had been good for us. Rob Oliver : Great, thanks. That's helpful. My follow up George is for you. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, a comment relative to Q4 in sales and marketing expenses and just wanted to just ask on that anything out of the ordinary relative to the kind of standard practice on investing in your channel around, you know .com growth and any color you can add there would be great. Thanks very much. George Kilguss : Yeah Rob, I would say nothing out of the ordinary. I think if you look in the past couple of years, we have tended to spend a little bit more in the sales and marketing area in the fourth quarter just based on the timing of events. This year, we had some activities that we\u2019re going to be early in the year, but with the pandemic in full swing, we kind of pivoted on some of those efforts and we've repositioned them here in the fourth quarter. So, I don't think there's anything unusual there, just the normal management of our marketing activities throughout the year. Rob Oliver : Great. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nick Jones with Citigroup. Nick Jones : Great, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, to the first one, I guess a little bit more on .web, can you expand on the decision that's, I guess, coming either later this year or early next year, I guess, in terms of is this kind of a definitive decision that puts this matter to rest or is it more of a decision to potentially extend the matter longer, just any, I guess, color on how to think about the timing of what we're waiting to hear? Jim Bidzos : Well we're waiting to hear the final resolution of this IRP. And just as a reminder, this IRP, this form of arbitration that's used in the ICANN community actually involves two parties, primarily that's affiliates, who's essentially the plaintiff here and ICANN [view as] the defendant. And as I mentioned in the question that I asked and answered, this is about whether ICANN follows its own policies and procedures when it makes decisions. So, that is what the panel will decide.  And our expectation, as I said is that following that resolution, the ICANN Board then \u2013 the matter will be returned to ICANN for its process, which is to make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. So that's the expectation, as in any litigation, it's really not proper to speculate on those outcomes, obviously, when something is pending, but we do know, in the process, what's pending here, which is a decision by the panel. And they have \u2013 the final hearing was scheduled and it was held and of course as a participant, but not a litigant so to speak. We were there at the table.  So, we're waiting hopefully by the end of this year or early next year, we will hear from the panel. They will answer the allegations by the plaintiff affiliates against ICANN and then the matter should be handed to the ICANN Board for resolution on the .web issue. That's our expectation. And that's what we hope to see. And then we'll certainly share with you what we know when we know it beyond that. Nick Jones : Great. And then a follow up, just one follow up on I guess just .com market share. So, there's some third party data out there that kind of indicates .com as regaining share despite their kind of being more, you know, I guess new TLDs? Why do you think that is? You know, is that what you're saying? Can you speak to kind of, you know, any trends you're seeing there? You know maybe making .com more popular versus new TLDs, I guess is there any thoughts or color around that would be great. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Well, I'll just say that, I mean, I don't know what data you're referring to. So, I can't really address that specifically. I can tell you though that the market does not consist only of .com and then new gTLDs or alternate TLDs. There's a large and thriving market of country code TLDs like .CN for China, .DE for Germany. Many of those have been commercialized like .CO from Colombia, .Co is the commercialized TLD that many, many organizations and individuals have chosen to brand themselves on. And there are a large number of those.  So, the market is far broader than that. Com is a good brand, and its performance is strong, and registrants like the .com brand, because it helps them get found. But beyond that, without seeing what you're referring to, I really can't comment on it. I would just caution that, very often when I think people talk about the market, they haven't really considered how large that market is. I would also refer you to our domain name brief. I think there's a good survey of all of the TLDs there. And I think if you look at that, you might get a slightly different picture. So, I hope that's helpful. Nick Jones : That is. Thank you for taking my questions. Jim Bidzos : Certainly. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll now take our last question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. So, going back to the domain name growth, in the context of the guidance that you\u2019ve given for the full-year, it would seem to indicate a slowdown in the year-over-year new registrations embedded in that. So, I guess my question is, do you think that there was some one-time you know benefits from COVID that you're not factoring into the guidance for the fourth quarter or what else is kind of influencing how you kind of guided here for full-year? George Kilguss : Yeah. Sterling, this is George. Yeah, so as you know, Sterling, there are just simply less selling days, I would put it in the fourth quarter. Typically, we see the fourth quarter new registrations dip seasonally. So, we're keeping an eye on that. Also, I think there's still some uncertainty with regard to COVID, and how that that disease may pick up here, globally. And so, some of that caution is also in the guidance that we're providing. Sterling Auty : Understood. And I know that .com is a thin registry, but based on your interactions with registrar's and industry participants, any sense as to what percentage of domains that are coming on board have e-commerce attached to them at this point, or any other type of granular breakdown you might have? George Kilguss : Yeah, as you mentioned, Sterling as a [thin registry], we don't quite have that that detail. We do hear from the registrar's that they are seeing more small businesses, stand up websites and grow that portion of their business, which I think is good for our business. But as far as the granular detail, I don't have that for you. I'm sorry. Sterling Auty : And that kind of brings, I don't know if you guys have seen it, but the Census Bureau has a number of business applications. And it looks like there was a significant spike in late summer coming into the fall. And you know, based on that comment, I wonder if you're seeing some of those come in or is there the potential that there might be a delayed tailwind? You know, from maybe new business formation? Jim Bidzos : Well, speaking for myself, I haven't seen that data. I don't know that we've correlated any data like that to domain name registrations in our common net zone, I think registrars are probably the first place that there would be some indication of that. I think clearly would have some indication for them that new business starts [are up] and that that there are increased domains name registrations in the U.S. associated with that. So, I think in general, the answer to your question is yes, but there's nothing I can think of in the data that would disagree with what you're saying. But in any detail or correlation, I don't think we have any. Sterling Auty : Got it? And one housekeeping, George, what's the number of names up for renewal in Q4? George Kilguss : In Q4, 34.8 million. Sterling Auty : Alright, great. And very last one, you commented a little bit, so I wanted to just put a fine point, you know, given bringing down the high-end of the operating margin for the full-year, what would you say the incremental spend that you're now factoring into that guidance is going to that maybe wasn't there before? Or is that the wrong way to look at it? George Kilguss : Well, as I think I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, you know, the increased expense year-over-year is really going to increase headcount. We've added about 34 or 36 heads since the beginning of the year. And a lot of those additional head counts are people that we have focused on our cybersecurity and I would say software, network engineering functions, and those show up in our R&D and our [G&A functions]. And so at the end of the quarter, our headcount was about 908 employees. So that was up from 872, at the end of the year. So, the only thing I'll say is, look we've, you know, we came out of 2018 with a similar level of headcount. We had about 900 people. We've been as high as a 1,000 employees in the business. If you step back and look at the prior years, you know, we've been in a gap operating expense range of around 110 million, 112 million a quarter, clearly in 2020 here in 2019, as we got out of, we sold the VSS security business, we had some moving pieces as we were reorganizing the company, but you know, and right now, we're at about 111 million for the quarter of gap operating expense here. So, we've been in this range for a long period of time, and we're \u2013 as we always are, we're managing the expenses of the business to meet the needs of the business. And I think we've been doing that reasonably well over the past seven or eight years, and we're going to continue to do that. But the answer to your question, it's really been this additional headcount that we've added in our security stability initiative. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you. Jim Bidzos : And Sterling, this is Jim. I would just add to that, you know, there's always a baseline funding that we make available and increase just simply because a huge aspect of what we do is cybersecurity, which is very difficult to predict. The threat environment is constantly evolving. It's generally always intensifying and increasing. And so, there are constant investments we make in training, education, new hires, people, technology, hardening our infrastructure and proving its resiliency that are ongoing. In addition, there are responses that we have to make to new threats that are anticipated. These just are routine and happen all the time, but the precise nature, the precise response, and therefore the price \u2013 the precise budgetary aspect of the response is difficult to predict. What you're seeing is our best estimates based on a long history of experience of doing these kinds of things. In addition, we fund research and that research evolves. And we recently identified, for example, a huge number of queries that were coming into the root servers, a massive spike in queries that were literally the result of unintentional activities, with a browser behavior that we were able to actually highlight point out, and help rectify, and eliminate a huge amount of volume that was that was hitting [indiscernible] root servers. There's quite a bit of this research that we do and publish, we've done work and name collisions. We do a lot of good instrumentation that helps manage and improve performance and security across the net.  We identified domains that are the source of [botnets], and other sorts of cyber attacks. We share those with different companies, government agencies. So the teams that are working on that are always evolving, growing training, hiring additional folks. That's our primary mission. We address it many Broadway's, but it's our top priority. So, it shouldn't be a surprise. There are times, you're going to see increased spending on it. It's just the nature of the business that we're in. And that's our expertise. And that's our mission. Sterling Auty : Make sense. Thank you, Jim. I really appreciate that. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the investor relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Recording of this call is not permitted, unless preauthorized. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please, go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full year 2020 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website, available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterwards, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. This past year has presented challenges and uncertainties for all of us. This has also been a year when our mission has never been more relevant. Like many of you, we spent the majority of the year with most of our teams working remotely. During this time, we continued to maintain, invest in and evolve our infrastructure, which enables us to reliably and accurately provide the critical DNS navigation service people around the world rely on more than ever, for commerce, education, healthcare and person-to-person connection, while complying with the high operational standards as required by our ICANN agreements. Thanks to the dedication of our team and the resilience of the specialized network they operate and maintain, we extended our record of DNS availability to over 23 years during 2020 and we will continue our focus, as it appears we will be working remotely well into 2021. Turning to our results. I'm pleased to report another consistent quarter that concludes a solid year of operational excellence for the company. As I mentioned in 2020, we marked more than 23 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. We also processed 42.4 million new registrations, delivered revenue of $1.265 billion and generated free cash flow of $687 million. During the full year 2020, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for $735 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for share repurchase by approximately $747 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remains stable, with $1.17 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 165.2 million consisting of 151.8 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. During the fourth quarter, we processed 10.5 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 1.46 million names. Although, renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 will be approximately 73.5%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.8% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 73.7% last quarter. Looking to 2021, we expect the domain name base growth rate of between 2.5% and 4.5%. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.54 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names, which raises the price from $7.85 to $8.39 effective September 1, 2021. This represents the first wholesale price increase of .com domain name since 2012 and is in alignment with a limited and regulated pricing flexibility permitted under our Registry Agreement. This announcement is consistent with our statements over the last several months that we expected to effectuate an increase in the wholesale price of .com domain names before October 25th 2021. We believe this positions .com competitively in the marketplace. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the company generated revenue of $1.265 billion, up 2.7% from 2019. Operating expense totaled $441 million and was up 3.6% from last year. For the fiscal year, the company delivered operating income of $824 million up 2.2% from $806 million a year ago and a full year operating margin of 65.2%. Fourth quarter revenue, came to $320 million up 3.1% year-over-year. Operating expense totaled $116 million, compared to $111 million last quarter and $112 million in the fourth quarter a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase, in operating expense is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing expenses. Fourth quarter operating income totaled $205 million, compared with $199 million in the same quarter of 2019. The operating margin in the quarter came to 63.9%, which was unchanged from the same quarter a year ago. Net income, totaled $157 million, compared to $148 million a year earlier which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.38 in the fourth quarter this year, compared to $1.26 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 included recognition of a $12.4 million of previously unrecognized income tax benefits, as a result of the lapse of certain statutes of limitations. This income tax benefit increased Q4 diluted earnings per share, by $0.11. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $195 million and free cash flow was $189 million, compared with $194 million and $185 million respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. I'll now discuss full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.300 billion to $1.320 billion. This revenue range forecast reflects the domain name base growth rate of between 2.5% and 4.5%, that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is expected to be between 64% and 65%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment, in our operational, infrastructure in 2021. Also, this range reflects the annual $4 million payment to ICANN, which began this year, to support activities to preserve and enhance the security, stability and resiliency of the DNS and the Internet. Interest expense and non-operating income net, is expected to be an expense of between $88 million to $92 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. This range reflects our ongoing investment in our infrastructure as well as an expected 2020 capital spend, that moved into 2021. The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021, to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance, throughout last year and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2021. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim, for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, George. I'd like to say again, that our priorities continue to be our mission of ensuring a secure, reliable and accurate operation of our critical Internet infrastructure and the safety of our people. And I also want to acknowledge once more, the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining and operating our infrastructure, even during the challenges of working remote during pandemic. Those efforts are undertaken almost entirely behind the scenes, that are not well known, but there are many hundreds of dedicated professionals that develop, maintain and operate our purpose-built network. And have done so without service interruption for over 23 years. Even today, some people may think we still operate an SSL Certificate Authority of PKI business that VeriSign's predecessor, RSA Data Security, built going all the way back to 1986. That business was sold in 2010 and we have increasingly tightened our focus on our core mission of secure Internet directory and registration services ever since. More information on just what we do today can be found on our homepage at verisign.com. Now we'd like to walk through your questions, which we believe is on your mind before opening the call for your additional questions. Many of you have asked are there any updates on the status of .web. As we noted last quarter, a final hearing took place in early August of 2020. We expect a decision from the panel in the coming weeks but we don't control the timing and the panel is not operating under any deadline. And as a reminder, VeriSign is not a party in these IRP proceedings but was granted the right to participate in certain limited aspects. Also as a reminder, an IRP under ICANN bylaws is for the purpose of ensuring that ICANN follow the term policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make a final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. The guidance we provided today does not include revenue or expenses related to .web. Now we'll open the call to your questions. Operator we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Thank you, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. George, I was just hoping we could walk maybe through a little bit more of the thought process on the expense structure for 2021? And then also I wanted to sort of maybe get some color on that. I know you guys had talked a little bit in recent quarters about spending some more on the security side and certainly looked [indiscernible] given the headlines that happened in December, but wanted to get a sense for where you are on that spend, whether the bodies that you need to hire have been hired? And then also on the CapEx comment just wanted to understand what it was that came out of last year and into this year and just get a little bit more color on the CapEx, which is higher than in our model I believe? David Atchley : Hello? Rob Oliver : Yes. Were you guys able to hear my question? David Atchley : Yes, we heard your question. George, I don't know if you were on mute but just double checking. George Kilguss : I'm sorry. Yes I was. So yes, thanks for the question Rob. Jim Bidzos : Sorry to make you answer through brilliantly twice George. George Kilguss : That's okay. I'll do my best. But we've been talking about this most of the year that we've been making additional investments in both our infrastructure and our cybersecurity initiatives. And you see this bearing out in our numbers as both R&D and G&A are up in those areas and we continue to invest in personnel and hardware and software tools in those areas. As far as 2021, we expect our expenses to be similar as a percent of revenue next year for most of the categories that we report on with the exception of cost of revenue which we expect will increase slightly as a percent of revenue for next year. As far as capital expenditures, as stated in my prepared remarks, capital expenditures are expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. And that again reflects ongoing investment in our infrastructure as well as some expected 2020 capital spend that slipped into 2021. We \u2013 as I mentioned, we guided between $55 million and $65 million. Last year we guided between $45 million and $55 million at this time. So this year's range is slightly higher than last year but we feel these investments are appropriate to continue to ensure the security and stability of our infrastructure. Rob Oliver : Great. That's helpful. Thanks, George. Appreciate it. And then Jim just one for you if I may. Just \u2013 obviously the price increases. So I'm glad you guys were able to get those through. On the domain outlook for the year, it's a bit of a wide range. And I just wanted to maybe get your thought process on that I guess probably understandable given a lot of macroeconomic puts and takes but just wanted to get your sense. And I think you said 2.5% to 4.5%. Appreciate that. Jim Bidzos : I'm sorry, did you just want clarification? Rob Oliver : Yes. Just -- right, I mean, would love some clarity on your thought process on that range? Jim Bidzos : I'm not sure, I can give you any more detail beyond that, I guess. Maybe I don't understand your question. Let me... Rob Oliver : Yes. So that -- that's, I mean at the low end of that range that's a growth number that would be below GDP growth. And just -- is there other elements of, when you saw some pull-forward potentially or maybe we didn't due to COVID where we saw some domain activity where you guys ended up the year at the high end of your - above the range of your initial big guidance which I think nobody would have expected probably in the spring. So is there a sense that we have a bit of a hangover from that on domains? And is that why the low end would be factored? And just any color there if possible would be great. George Kilguss : Yes, Rob, this is George. Maybe I can jump in here a little bit. So I would say in general the trends that we're seeing in the domain name base are similar to the trends we've been seeing in the last few quarters in that registrars from both North America and EMEA are performing very well and that growth has been slightly offset by some slower activity from registrars based in China. But as you saw, yes, in the fourth quarter we had a pretty solid quarter delivering about 10.5 million registrations which was up from 10.3 a year ago. And during the year as we talked about we have seen some increased demand in those regions from people looking to get online, new business starts and there's been new functionality created in the registrar community from website builders. As we look into next year, we still see those trends continuing. However, we're not sure how the market will react as we come out of this work-from-home environment. And so we're being -- we typically do have a range this wide going into the year. January is off to a pretty good start. But right now we sit here that's our expectation between 2.5% and 4.5%. And as we go through the year we'll update you on that range. Rob Oliver : Great. Thank you. Jim Bidzos : Yes. I understand your question. I guess I -- if the idea is to sort of, associate some macroeconomic considerations and somehow relate them to the guidance that we gave, I think, probably the only thing I can really say about that is that there's obviously some uncertainty associated with how COVID is going to play out in 2021. There are a lot of ups and downs and gives and takes and that certainly is a factor that affected. But as George said there's a lot of factors that go into the range. But I would say if you wanted one macroeconomic indicator there's obviously some uncertainty around COVID. That's probably the single biggest influence in that range. Rob Oliver : Okay. Thank you again. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from Nick Jones with Citi. Nick Jones : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first and this is probably splitting hairs. But could you have taken another $0.01 in the price increase or is it because like it's slightly over 7% you can't? I guess any clarity there? And then, I guess, a follow-up is -- go ahead. Jim Bidzos : I'm sorry. You've got it right. The problem is that if you apply -- we don't bill in fractions of $0.01. And the actual increase came in with a 0.9 on the -- to the right of the decimal points in pennies. And so even though the number was a nine we rounded down because otherwise we would be slightly over the 7%. Nick Jones : Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then on COVID, kind of, threw a wrinkle I think into potentially how investors were thinking about the price increases. How should we think about the cadence from here? I mean, is it something that's like you, kind of, expect to happen annually? Is there room to compress the timeframe and take them earlier? I guess, just how are you thinking about the cadence of the price increases over the next few years as the windows open? George Kilguss : Nick, this is George. Jim Bidzos : I'm sorry. I was on mute, George. I'm sorry. Mute is tricky. I will let George weigh in but basically we don't guide to future price increases. And today's announcement is only for an increase in .com domain registration fee, that's effective and begins on September 1 of this year. Beyond that, obviously, we don't guide. George, do you want to comment? Please go ahead. George Kilguss : Those are going to be my comments Jim as well. Jim Bidzos : Yes, sorry, I was on mute there for... Nick Jones : Okay. One last question just kind of as COVID restrictions may be loosened, in certain markets vaccines are rolling out. Are you seeing any change in kind of the trends we saw in 2020 in terms of people's SMBs switching to digital solutions, people leaning into online solutions? Is there any meaningful changes and trends kind of early in the year in certain regions, even just within the US in terms of registrations or anything to kind of give you pause as to kind of how the reopening may impact these trends? Thanks. George Kilguss : Yes. Nick, this is George. I don't see any materially difference in the trends that we saw last quarter even through January. The only thing I'll just mention is, we do have a little seasonality in our business from time to time and we do get impacted by holidays and the Chinese New Year this year is a little bit later. I think it was in late January last year and it's in early February this year. But, other than that to answer your question, nothing yet that we've seen to change our views. Nick Jones : Great, thanks for taking the question. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. When I saw that you announced the price increase, I'm like damn, what am I going to ask on the call now that you announced the increase? Jim Bidzos : Well, that -- is that the question? Sterling Auty : No. No, of course not. All right. So, let's start with renewal rate, the down 20 bps year-over-year. Anything that you saw in particular this year, whether it be -- I noticed that over the last month, there was a couple of days : one where I think the domain base was down 93,000; another one that was down like 102. Sometimes I usually equate that to some of the registrars going through and doing some purges. So, anything like that that may have impacted the renewal rate in the quarter? George Kilguss : Sterling, as you pointed out, the renewal rate was relatively flat year-over-year. I think 73.5% in the fourth quarter versus 73.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019. So, relatively similar. We did have a very strong 2019 performance from China-based registrars. And as we talked before, as a group we tend to see first time renewal rates come out a little bit lower. And as that cohort was renewing this year that did put a little downward pressure, I would say, on our first time renewing rates for the international group as a whole. But again, I think overall 73.5% was a pretty good result. Sterling Auty : Now that makes sense. You made the comment that .web, neither the revenue or expenses, are factored into the guidance. If we just say hypothetically that you get the approval and you can move forward to getting it up and running, what should be some of the cost levels that investors should expect to get it launched, and perhaps some of your thoughts around the marketing muscle in terms of spend that you might put behind at launch? Jim Bidzos : Sterling I think -- I guess, with all of the process part of the IRP complete and we're waiting, I think I can say -- repeat what I have said earlier, which is that we're -- we hope that we're weeks away from something from the panel. We're certainly closer as time moves on, but I think it's just too early to give any indication of a timeline from there to the launch of web or any of the costs associated with it. It's just kind of early. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then last question from my side is, in the US if you look at the new business applications, they spiked late summer early fall. So, I think August, September time frame, but they're still elevated in the fourth quarter especially on a year-over-year basis. If I think about that relative to your new domain registrations the 10.5, new registrations have been up relative to historical norms for a while now, is there a correlation there? And does that actually will give you some confidence that hopefully the economy opens back up on the back of vaccines and perhaps we could see even faster domain growth in 2021? George Kilguss : So, Sterling, we've seen that same data. And as you know we're a thin registry. So we do get some insights from our registrar partners and from what we hear from them. Yes, new business starts and companies finding that they can better serve their customers by having a website and ergo domain name helps to facilitate that. I think that's been good for our business here in this work-for-home environment. As Jim mentioned, when the pandemic subsides and things start opening it up, I think it could probably go either way either it could accelerate or it could slow a little bit. We're just not sure how the market would react just as we were somewhat uncertain when this whole pandemic started but that clearly is a possibility. Sterling Auty : And maybe just a follow-up to that. On mix of domains, the new TLDs I think have given back some of the share that we saw them -- saw that category gain in years past, are you seeing that mix having any impact on your business? Jim Bidzos : I guess, the mix of -- I am not sure I understood this. Sterling Auty : Well, to be more specific you're a thin registry, but you work with hundreds of registrars on a global basis. Are registrars coming back to you given that you do marketing programs and suggesting that they want to put more muscle behind .com because they're just not seeing the traction that perhaps they expected in the new TLDs? Jim Bidzos : I guess, I would just -- I think the best answer I can give you to that question is, one, that I think is just a simple fact which is .com is a recognizable brand that helps people get found online. It's a popular well-established brand. I don't know -- I'm not aware of any specific deliberate effort that we've been informed of any kind of a shift like you're describing. George do you want to add anything to that? George Kilguss : Yeah. I think that's right Jim. I mean I think that's probably a great question for one of the registrar's earnings calls but as to what they're seeing specifically. But our programs tend to be relatively set at the beginning of the year. We rolled them out we announced them and we tend not to change them too much year-over-year or intra-year I would say. But I don't think I have anything more to add than what Jim commented on. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you so much. George Kilguss : Thanks. Operator : I'd like to now turn the call back to Mr. David Atchley for any final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.

Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of performance for VeriSign. During the first quarter, we saw increased demand for our domain names across most regions as businesses continue to expand their online presence. During the first quarter, we processed 11.6 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2.8 million names. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled $168 million, consisting of 154.6 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 4.6%. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75.9%. This preliminary rate compares to 75.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and 73.5% last quarter. As we look forward for fiscal 2021, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 4.0% and 5.5%. This updated range reflects the strength we've witnessed in new additions to the base and our outlook for the balance of the year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver solid financial results while maintaining, investing in and evolving our critical infrastructure and complying with high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the DNS navigation service people around the world rely on for commerce, education, health care and person-to-person connection. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.18 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the first quarter totaled $173 million for 876,000 shares. At quarter end, $910 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Regarding .web, we have been informed that the independent review process panel formally declared the IRP hearing closed on April 7, 2021. Under the applicable arbitration rules, the IRP panel should now issue a final decision within 60 days from that date. As a reminder, an IRP, under ICANN's bylaws, is for the purpose of ensuring that Ican followed its own policies and procedures when making decisions. Our expectation is that following the resolution of the IRP, the ICANN Board will make the final decision on the delegation of the .web TLD. The updated guidance we're providing today does not include any revenue or expenses related to .web. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the company generated revenue of $324 million, up 3.6% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $210 million, up 2% from $206 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $113 million compared to $116 million last quarter and $106 million in the first quarter a year ago. The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of incremental and continued operational investments in personnel and infrastructure. The operating margin in the quarter was 65% compared to 66% over the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $150 million compared to $334 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.33 in the first quarter this year compared to $2.86 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the first quarter last year included the recognition of $168 million of previously unrecognized noncash income tax benefits, which increased diluted earnings per share by $1.44. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $198 million, and free cash flow was $192 million compared with $180 million and $169 million, respectively, for the first quarter last year. The year-over-year increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the increased volume of new registrations and renewals, partially offset by higher cash payments for operating expenses. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.315 billion to $1.330 billion. This narrowed and increased revenue range forecast reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4% and 5.5% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is still expected to be between 64% and 65%. This guidance reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel in 2021. Interest expense in nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $88 million to $ 92 million. Capital expenditures are also still expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%, and we expect the cash tax rate for our 2021 fiscal year to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution throughout 2021. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. In closing, I want to acknowledge the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining and operating our critical Internet infrastructure, even during the challenges of working remotely during the pandemic. Now we will open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Jim Bidzos : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Rob Oliver of Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. First one, Jim, for you. Just clearly, macro trends appear better with you guys taking up the range on domains on the revenue side. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that, that was sort of strength across the board. And I was wondering if you could add a little more context to that, maybe both from a geographic perspective to see if there are any particular pockets of strength as well as maybe to talk about some of the dynamics that you believe are driving or what you guys are seeing driving that increased domain activity. And then I had a follow-up. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks. Well, first of all, I think the recovering economy is certainly contributing to increased Internet use, and that includes additional domain name used. Good part of the strength came from the U.S., but it was very broad-based in virtually all geographic regions. We do have limited visibility recall through our channel. But certainly, the ads this quarter were broad-based across all regions, driven, I think, primarily by recovering economy and the economic activity that comes with it. But also recall that Common Net are trusted brands and as people continue to get online, our ads are certainly going to benefit from it and they did this quarter. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. And then George, just one follow-up for you. I know you guys, going back a couple of quarters, have talked a bit about the need for increased operational spend for your infrastructure and R&D and security and things like that. I guess couple of questions. How do you feel you are in that trajectory? And I guess, by your implied increased revenue guide for the year for maintaining the margin you guys are looking to probably spend a little bit more. And just wanted to get a sense for you spending on the same things and how you're thinking about that this year. George Kilguss : Yes. Thanks, Rob. Similar to last year and continued this year, we continue to spend, as you indicate, and invest in areas of cybersecurity as well as infrastructure areas. And those are both in personnel as well as new software tools. And you can see that our headcount for the year -- for the quarter ended at 918 people. We're continuing to execute on our plans this year. We'll continue to make investments in those areas. And hence, the guidance range of 64% to 65% for operating margin is still appropriate. Operator : We will now go to our next question, and that will be from Nick Jones with Citi. Nick Jones : Great. I have two. I guess the first one, can you just expand a little bit on the time line for .web? 60 days from the seventh, a decision needs to be made, and then it sounds like there potentially is additional time after that. I guess how should we be thinking about the 60-day time line in the context of when .web will be delegated and then when .web can kind of start being issued to consumers? Jim Bidzos : Well, first of all, the -- so the announcement from the IRP panel was that they had concluded their hearing on April 7, and that started the 60-day clock that you're referring to. So they have concluded the hearing. We assume that in that time frame, their final report will be issued. So that being the, hopefully, final step in the litigation part of this process, we don't comment on that pending litigation. I'll just simply say that according to their announcement, by the time we're talking again next quarter, we should have quite a bit more to say. So I think until that happens, it's premature to discuss exactly when and how .web will be delegated. And then we get it launched then into the hands of consumers. It's just simply too early to speculate about exactly how that will play out. As I mentioned, we do expect that at the a conclusion here when we do see the IRP report that the ICANN Board will then proceed to determine the delegation of .web. When we get to that point, I think, we'll be able to say more about the timing of our own efforts. But until then, it would be premature. So at least we know now that we'll have, hopefully, a lot more to say the next time we talk to you next quarter. Nick Jones : Great. Great. And then I guess, I look at the domain name industry brief. TLD -- TLDs declined. I think it's like $4.5 million or a little less sequentially, .com continues to grow. Can you talk about kind of what's underpinning, I guess, what would be share gains in terms of .com gaming and TLDs and maybe why others are declining? Any thoughts on those trends? Jim Bidzos : Well, so let me just say, first of all, that we did understand that this broad-based bit of growth in ads that we had this quarter. The registrars are reporting, this is growth from small businesses and individuals, and it's broad-based. The competitive registries, we don't have insights into their particular businesses and their exact numbers. I'll just simply say that as people are getting online, Common Net are trusted brands, and we continue to see that growth. The registrars are having success with them, and we're pleased with that growth in the quarter. Operator : And we will take our last question from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : So just following along that line of questioning, the $11.6 million gross new registration in the quarter was up nicely versus what you saw last year. You pointed to both small business and consumers, but I'm wondering what you might be hearing back from the registrars in terms of the mix. How much of this might be tied to the continued elevated new business application data that we see versus maybe other types of consumer use cases for domains? Jim Bidzos : Yes. George, do you want to comment there? George Kilguss : Yes. I would say, Sterling, we don't quite get a detailed mix of all the registrars. I can tell you that from what we do here, the -- they're seeing good demand for consumer -- I mean, businesses wanting to get online. As you know, over the last couple of years, registrars have invested a lot of money in increasing the utility of a domain name and making it much easier to build a website and get online for consumers. And as a result, we're seeing registrar spending a lot more money, advertising and marketing to these small businesses to bring them online. And I think that has been helpful for the domain name industry. As far as the economy, the only insight we have there is that registrars just believe that this is -- this trend is a pretty good trend. I think it'll continue for the rest of the year. And when we query it to that, they just reply back that they feel the economy is opening up and that's supporting some of that optimism on their part. Sterling Auty : And then if you look at the total number of new TLDs, it's been in kind of a steady decline from when it hits the peak back in, let's say, September of 2020. How much of that is just kind of failed marketing programs? And have you heard from the registrars that they just kind of, back to Jim, your comment, .com and .net are trusted domains, are you just feeling like you're starting to regain share? And is there more marketing dollars being put behind .com and .net at this point? Jim Bidzos : Well, let me -- I'll ask George to comment on that. But first, let me just add this and this sort of goes to next question earlier as well. I think what we're not mentioning here is, this is a very competitive marketplace, and we haven't mentioned the country code TLDs, especially the ones that have been commercialized, for example, .co, .tv. Many of these country code TLDs that are not new gTLDs, not legacy TLDs. So the market is a little bit bigger than all of that. I just wanted to make sure that we understood that there's a bigger picture there that we normally don't talk about and have limited visibility into. But many of them have been commercialized, and so they certainly need to be factored in. George, do you want to comment further? I think, Sterling, the other half of your question was about marketing. George Kilguss : Sure. So I don't really have any insight into the marketing activities of the new gTLDs. But if you go to ICANN's records, which are public and you look at some of that data for new gTLDs, I think, the decline in the new gTLDs is really centered in a few TLDs that had some very rapid rise a year or 2 ago. And I think as they come up for renewal, maybe they're not renewing as well. I don't have any specific insight into them unless what I see -- or based on what I see here in the ICANN data, but I think that decline is really specific to just a few TLDs that had very a strong growth in prior years. Sterling Auty : Got you. And then for your own marketing programs here for 2021, can you give us a sense, within the context of the guidance you've given around margins? How should we think about the the marketing spend and in light of a potential favorable ruling on .web, what should we be thinking about the plans to put the marketing muscle behind the launch of .web? George Kilguss : So this is George, Sterling. So as far as .web and marketing muscle, I just think it's too early at that point. The guidance that we provided this year for both revenue expense, as Jim mentioned, doesn't include any revenue or expense associated with .web. Once we have the TLD delegated, and we've got our plans in place, then we'll be able to communicate that. As far as our own sales and marketing programs, you saw us spend a little bit more in sales and marketing in the first quarter compared to last year. We had -- I think, that's more about some of the programs we curtailed in 2020 in the first quarter as a result of the pandemic coming on and people working toward home -- working from home. This year, we're continuing to execute on our direct marketing plans as well as the other programs that we rolled out at the beginning of the year. And as far as I can tell, it's really business as usual for us here this year as well. Sterling Auty : All right. Great. And last question because I get it quite a bit. I kind of know probably how you're going to answer, but I want to ask in a public forum anyway. .net in pricing. So you made a price decision here on .com, it's been announced. But it's been a little bit since you last took a price action on .net. What are your thoughts around -- what you might be doing here with pricing for .net in 2021 or 2022? Jim Bidzos : Yes, Sterling, and I'll give you the -- you've asked the same question. I have to give you the same answer. We don't guide to pricing, of course. I'll just point out that .net is competitively priced. .com is, of course, below it at this point, but we don't guide to the future pricing decisions. And as you pointed out, we do have a a price increase for .com that will be effective in September. Operator : And with that, that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn things back to David Atchley for any additional or closing comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : And again, everyone, that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign second quarter 2021 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Struby, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you'll also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Forms 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign; adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thanks David and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. During the second quarter, we saw continued demand for our domain names, including year-over-year growth in new registrations from some of our foreign geographies. During the second quarter, we processed 11.7 million new registrations and the domain name base increased by 2.59 million names. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 170.6 million, consisting of 157 million names for .com and 13.6 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 5.2%. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75.3%. This preliminary rate compares to 72.8% achieved in the second quarter of 2020% and 76% last quarter. As we look at full year 2021, we now expect the domain name base growth rate of between 4.7% and 6%. This range reflects the strength we continue to observe in new additions to the base and our outlook for the balance of the year. During the quarter, we continued to deliver solid financial results while maintaining investing in an evolving our critical infrastructure and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the DNS navigation service which people around the world depend on for commerce, education, health care, and person-to-person connection. Just last week we marked 24 years of uninterrupted availability of our .com and .net domain name resolution system. Our financial and liquidity position remain stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the second quarter totaled $172 million for 797,000 shares. At quarter end, $737 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Regarding .web, on May 20th, a final decision was issued in the Independent Review Process or IRP. The final decision rejected affiliates' petition to nullify the results of the .web auction and rejected affiliates' request to be awarded .web, also as we had requested, the final decision directed ICANN\u2019s Board of Directors to review the objections, including objections as to affiliates' conduct and to make a determination on the delegation of .web. After the final decision was issued, however, affiliate\u2019s filed an application requesting that the IRP panel interpret and amend its final decision. We believe affiliates' application is without merit and expects the panel to -- we expect the panel to rule on it in the fourth quarter of 2021, thereafter, we expect ICANN\u2019s Board will proceed consistent with the final decision, and it will make a determination on the delegation of .web. The updated guidance we are providing today does not include revenue, or expenses related to .web. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2021, the company generated revenue of $329 million, up 4% from the same quarter in 2020 and delivered operating income of $213 million, up 3% from $207 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $116 million compared to $113 million last quarter and $108 million in the second quarter a year ago. The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel. The operating margin in the quarter was 64.7% compared to 65.8% for the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $148 million compared to $152 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.31 in the second quarter this year compared to $1.32 for the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, the company redeemed and favorably refinanced its $750 million, 4.625% senior notes due in 2023 through the issuance of new $750 million, 2.7% senior notes, which mature in June 2031. We are pleased with the result of this refinancing, which will result in interest expense savings of over $14 million annually for the company. As part of the refinancing, we wrote-off $2.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs on the 2023 notes. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $143 million and free cash flow was $125 million, compared with $215 million and $204 million, respectively for the second quarter of 2020. The year-over-year difference in operating cash flow, primarily relates to cash taxes from a combination of higher cash taxes this year, as well as last year's second quarter operating cash flow benefiting from lower cash flow tax payments due to the permitted deferral of approximately $52 million of US federal tax payments until the third quarter of 2020. I will now discuss our updated full-year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.322 billion to $1.331 billion. This narrowed and increased revenue range forecast, reflects the updated domain name base, growth rate expectation of between 4.7% and 6% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 64.25% and 65%. This guidance range reflects our expectation of incremental and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel in 2021. Interest expense and non-operating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $83 million to $87 million. This reflects lower interest expense following the refinancing that was completed during the second quarter. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2021. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. We continued our work to protect grow and manage the business while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. Before we open the call for your questions, I'd like to touch on some other things we're doing at VeriSign. I have updated you on previous earnings calls on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship in particular under our VeriSign Cares program. In recent months, we've expanded our work to help those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways including; alleviating food and security caused by COVID-related economic hardship in areas where we have a footprint, providing medical and other relief in India, where the pandemic took a significant turn for the worse earlier this year and our ongoing and growing efforts to help those jobs or careers have been affected by COVID to retrain and pivot to new careers in the tech industry. We've also kept our focus on the area of equity and justice both working with existing partners and adding new ones. You can read more about all of these initiatives in the new section we added to our investor website this quarter on our ESG work. And now we'll open the call to your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rob Oliver from R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Rob Oliver : Great. Hi, good afternoon. Thank you, guys for taking my question. Jim, I would just start with you on very strong renewal rates. And obviously, you guys raising the domain growth guide again. You called out some foreign geographies, which saw I believe strong renewal trends. So just was wondering if we can get a little bit of color on kind of where you're seeing pockets globally of strength whether some of that surprised you, whether it's COVID recovery-related or any color around the foreign geography comment? Jim Bidzos : Sure. I'll let George or Todd comment on that. George Kilguss : Yes. Thanks, Jim. Rob, this is George. So with regard to domain demand, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks and as you alluded to, we had a very solid quarter from a domain perspective. New units were $11.7 million and that was up about 600,000 from the year ago period. As far as regional preferences -- performance goes, I would say that US registrars performed similar to a year ago quarter, with a slight increase in demand coming from various international regions. As Jim mentioned, for example, both China and the EMEA regions were up year-over-year in new registrations. As far as renewal rates, as Jim mentioned, our preliminary renewal rate is 75% and that's up from 78% a year ago. I would say, part of the improvement there relates to a combination of the mixture of first time and previously renewed names, with the previously renewed name cohorts getting a little larger as the base ages, as well as the geographic mix. As you may recall, back in 2019, we had a higher proportion of new units coming out of China, out of that region, which came up for renewal in 2020 and contributed to a slightly lower average first-time renewal rate in 2020. We had more mature regions like the US and EMEA contribute to a larger portion of our new unit growth. So those historically higher renewing rate regions have helped our first-time renewal rate a little bit this year. So a combination of those two factors, but our first-time renewal rates are in the 50% range and our previous renewal rates are slightly up, but they are still in the mid 80% range. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. George, that's really helpful. And then, just one follow-up. Jim, just I want to make sure that I understand the potential timeline on .web. So with affiliates now having filed the motion, I guess, that now has to be ruled upon by the board, that then happens before the final ruling by ICANN. So I think you said Q4 2021 on the newer motion that was filed by affiliates. So if that's right, what then would be your expectation for timing, assuming you guys were then to win .web since, maybe, if the folks filing the motion aren\u2019t even in the business anymore, assuming you guys win, what would be the timing of it? Jim Bidzos : Well, that will be dependent on ICANN\u2019s timeframe for picking up what the IRP panel instructed them to do, which is to complete their process on .web and get it delegated. So I can't speak for that ICANN process, but that's what would occur following a ruling on that latest motion. ICANN would then basically do what the panel instructed. It was essentially remanded back to ICANN. So there is this delay with this current motion, but then it will go back to ICANN and they would conduct their process and determine the delegation of the TLDs. So, hopefully, that won't take too long, but I can't speak for ICANN. Rob Oliver : Great. Okay, guys, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Jim Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nick Jones from Citi. Nick Jones : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe another one on geographic trends and I think, as APAC still has pretty low internet penetration relative to kind of North America and Western Europe, is there any sense of .com\u2019s popularity in those regions as, I guess, more people come online? And does that -- is that kind of a tailwind in the region for VeriSign or .com over time? And then I have a second question. Jim Bidzos : All right. George or Todd. George Kilguss : All right. Yes. So, Nick, this is George. I mean, I would just say that, look at comments of global brand. And we obviously try to continue to market our brand to be a very high-quality reliable brand across the world. As far as China is concerned as I mentioned last year, China was a little bit quieter while the pandemic was going on. And we've seen some of our registrars there had some increased demand and are doing well. So China is picking up. I do think China is a little bit of a different of a market though. I think China is much more of a platform and mobile-driven market. While domain names are still very relevant there and important they are driven more in these platforms. But as I mentioned China has performed better year-over-year in the second quarter here. And we'll see how they continue to perform, but they're still quite active over there. Nick Jones : Great. Thanks. Then maybe just taking a step back looking at the line about 100% availability for 24 years and as the Internet has evolved quite a bit and maybe the velocity of usage and I guess what's weighing the overall system, I guess increases over time what's the impact on availability in the future? You got cryptominers you got just more and more people using the Internet for more and more things. I guess what impact does that have kind of from here, or how are you thinking about it from here versus kind of the last 24 years? Jim Bidzos : Well that's a natural and good question given the expanded use of the Internet and particularly during COVID so many people working from home additional load etcetera, etcetera. I'll just say that the design of our network besides resiliency is there's also a design element of capacity and it's always been designed with overcapacity as part of the resiliency sort of formula. And I'll just say that the volume of traffic anticipated we're still meeting all of our obligations including specific performance and response time obligations. We have no difficulty meeting those with the demand. It's essentially part of all the planning that we get. It always has been from the beginning. So, it's not a new consideration in that sense. We've planned for it. Nick Jones : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Jim Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our last question from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Drew on for Sterling. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on what you're expecting for renewal rates in the second half of the year as we lap the surge in new businesses from 2020? George Kilguss : Yes. So Drew this is George. We don't guide to renewal rates, but we do guide to the domain name base. And obviously our guide is up from last quarter. Last quarter we were guiding 4% to 5.5%. Obviously now we've increased that guidance to 4.7% to 6%. So, we're still expecting growth in domain name base but we don't guide to specific quarters. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited. And our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or lines during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and 2 non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign : adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for, your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thanks, David. And good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. During the quarter, we continued to deliver strong financial results while maintaining, investing in and evolving our critical internet infrastructure and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. Our critical infrastructure enables us to reliably and accurately provide the domain name system navigation service, which people around the world depend on for commerce, education, healthcare and person-to-person connection. During the third quarter, we processed 10.7 million new registrations. And the domain name base increased by 1.48 million names. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 172.1 million, consisting of 158.6 million names for .com and 13.5 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 5.1%. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2021 will be approximately 75%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.7% achieved in the third quarter of 2020 and 75.4% last quarter. For the full year 2021, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 4.7% and 5.5%. This narrower range reflects the current pace of new additions to the base and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the third quarter totaled $172 million for 785,000 shares. At quarter end $565 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. As it relates to .web, and as we stated last quarter, after the final IRP decision was issued in May Afilias' filed in June an application requesting that the IRP panel interpret and amend its final decision. The briefing on this application was completed in September. And the panel has now taken the matter under advisement without oral argument, which means we're just waiting for the IRP panel to respond. VeriSign believes Afilias' application is without merit, and we continue to expect the panel to rule on it in the fourth quarter of 2021. As we have said before, we continue to look forward to becoming the .web registry operator and establishing it as an additional option for businesses and individual end users worldwide. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim. And good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 30, 2021 the company generated revenue of $334 million, up 5.1% from the same quarter in 2020. And delivered operating income of $221 million, up 7.1% from the $207 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $113 million compared to $116 million last quarter and $111 million in the third quarter last year. Operating margin in the quarter was 66.2% compared to 64.7% last quarter and 65% in the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $157 million compared to $171 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.40 in the third quarter this year compared to $1.49 for the same quarter last year. As noted in our earnings release, net income for the third quarter of last year included previously unrecognized tax benefits of $24 million, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.21. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $260 million and free cash flow was $245 million compared with $140 million and $125 million, respectively for the third quarter of 2020. Cash flow this quarter benefited from an increase of $45 million of deferred revenue, which was primarily related to early domain name renewal activity before the .com price increase went into effect. The main impact of these early renewals is the pulling forward of cash flow from future quarters into the third quarter of this year. Additionally, comparing year-over-year third quarter cash flow, last year's third quarter cash flow was lower due to the permitted deferral of approximately $52 million of U.S. federal tax payments from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2020. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2021 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.330 billion. This narrowed revenue range reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 4.7% and 5.5%, as Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 64.8% and 65.3%. This range reflects our expectation of incremental spend on marketing programs and continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel during the fourth quarter. Interest expense and non-operating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $83 million to $87 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $55 million and $60 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 20% and 23%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2021 to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter. And we look forward to continuing our focused execution. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. Before we open the call for your questions, I would like to touch on some other things that we continue to do here at VeriSign. I've updated you in previous earnings calls on our commitment to responsible corporate citizenship principally through our VeriSign Cares program. During the third quarter, we established 3 new partnerships under the VeriSign Cares workforce retraining initiative. This greatly increases both the number of individuals we can help and our geographical coverage. Combined, our partners now reach dollars in 17 states plus the District of Columbia with remote options accessible throughout the U.S. And our partner organizations have expansion plans of their own, which we're pleased to support. We're delighted to note that our launch partner for this initiative, Virginia Ready recently passed the milestone of 3,000 scholars who have graduated from their program. And as a reminder, the objective of the VeriSign Cares program is to address pressing economic and social needs in the communities in which we live and work. We instituted this workforce retraining initiative in 2020 to provide individuals whose employment has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with access to training and other assistance to help them pivot into the technology sector. You can learn more about these efforts on blog.verisign.com. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead. Rob Oliver : Great. Thank you. Good evening, guys. A couple of questions for me. First, one for you, Jim. Just on the macro that you're seeing right now with business starts, I mean there's been some data this quarter. I think University of Michigan sentiment indicators rolling over a little bit. A lot of small, medium-sized business survey work we've seen expressing some concern. I think it's a mix of labor shortages as well as concerns heading into next year. It seems that the reduction of the high end of the domain growth name is just really a function of the timing here into Q4. I mean you guys have had a strong year. But can you talk a little bit about what you're hearing and seeing in the market relative to the prospects for demand activity going forward and kind of what you're seeing? Jim Bidzos : Sure, Rob. I can say a few things about it. I don't know if I can map with any specificity activity in the domain name space, specifically with any quarterly economic activity. I can tell you that COVID has certainly been a factor. We've seen up and downs with COVID of course, from early 2020 on through where things improved a bit. Then we saw the Delta variant and things went in the wrong direction. Now they're improving again. I don't know exactly how the timing maps to that. But certainly, that does have some effect. And we can't tell you yet. We haven't studied it sufficiently to tell you exactly what that might do. So certainly, all of those things are factored. Business starts are a factor. But essentially, COM is a strong brand. People are branding themselves. People are acquiring domain names. They're the preferred way to have their identity online. And I think you see that the long-term trend line is not only in the right direction, but I think generally consistent with our yearly performance and seasonality. There's just no doubt a COVID influence that we can't map with any precision for you right now. Rob Oliver : Got it. Got it. Okay. That's fair. Thank you. And then, George one for you. Just on the strong margin performance this quarter. And I know you guys have made a series of investments over the past year plus both in security timely ones as well as infrastructure and provisioning as well as people. I'm just curious about the margin expansion that we saw and sort of the durability of that? Or is it more of kind of a onetime benefit? Thank you. George Kilguss : Thanks, Rob. So when you look at our operating expenses, clearly the sequential decrease is primarily due to a mix of the small decrease in G&A spending and some marketing activity in the quarter. And as you mentioned, year-over-year we have a slight increase from our continued investment in our operational infrastructure and personnel. Again, I would say we are managing the total expenses of the business as best we can. And we continue to look at where we're spending money and making sure we're spending them in the right areas. And if we're not, we're redirecting that into the business. We provided guidance on our operating margin for the full year of 64.8 to 65.3. And we'll give you some additional guidance on our year-end call as to what we think next year is. But we do have up and downs each quarter. But we continue to make the investments that we feel are appropriate for the business. Rob Oliver : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Nick Jones with Citi. Please go ahead. Nick Jones : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess one on .web. I guess, could you maybe remind us on assuming the TLD is delegated to you, you can start registering it. What is kind of the timeframe from when you're able to register to when consumers can actually buy? Is that like a relatively quick turnaround? Or are we looking at a couple of quarters once you're able to when .web could start showing up? Jim Bidzos : Okay. Nick, if I understand your question correctly, you're not asking about the process we're in now with the IRP. You're saying if that should be resolved, handed to ICANN as the panel ruled before and this application fails in some point. .web is delegated to us, you're asking what the process is to actually start registering domain names. Do I understand your question correctly? Nick Jones : Correct. Jim Bidzos : Okay. So it's more like I think you're the latter part of your assumption there. There are some couple of quarters because there are periods of activity that are mandated by the process. We have to run a sunrise period. We have to do some security things. We have to let people who have trademarks come in and get theirs first. So it's a bit early to speculate exactly when. But the answer is closer to a couple of quarters. It's getting from delegation to actually beginning to register domain names. There's just some process work that's required to do for safety, security and respect for trademarks. Nick Jones : Got it. And then I guess a follow-up to that is when you think about brands maybe trying to protect their trademarks, do you have any proxy as to whether people are buying like .shops or other TLDs and at which rate? Is it common for people to kind of protect their trademarks by buying all the TLDs? Or are there just certain ones? Any color or visibility you have into how brands behave? Jim Bidzos : Yeah, it varies a lot. I don't think there's any general single rule you can make. It's certainly true that people buy what are called defensive registrations to protect their marks. Many of them buy variants of them. Lots of them buy multiple registrations in com, net and other TLDs in order to protect things that are even similar to their mark. So that occurs in other TLDs not all of them. It just varies. I would refer you to our domain name industry briefs. And I think you can get some sense just looking at the lay of the land, so to speak, the landscape of TLDs. I think that would give you some insights and help you understand that. Nick Jones : Got it. Great. Thanks for taking questions. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : We'll take our final question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi, guys. So maybe we could start with the 10.7 million new names that were processed in the quarter. Can you give us some color as to what you saw on a geographic basis? Where was the strongest growth? And where perhaps were there areas of softness? George Kilguss : Sterling, this is George. So as you mentioned, we had 10.7 million of new registrations in the third quarter. And that was pretty similar to what we did in the third quarter a year ago. So still a healthy level of registrations for the company. As far as regional performance goes, we saw year-over-year new registration strength from registrars in areas such as EMEA, APAC and China during the quarter and North American registrars as new registrations were a bit lower during the third quarter compared to the year ago quarter. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then when you look at the base that was up for renewal, how is the mix of names that were up for renewal for the first time as a percentage of the total as compared to what you experienced in the other quarters of the year? George Kilguss : Again, when you talk about renewal rates we had a total renewal rate of about 75% in the third quarter. And that was similar to the first and second quarter. They were both in the mid-70% range. What I think you're alluding to is a year ago our renewal rate was 73.7%. And so when you look at the year-over-year improvement a lot of that does come from the mix of the names coming up for renewal. And I think as we talked about last quarter if you look back at 2019, we had a lot of higher percentage of names coming out of registrars from China and other areas that typically have lower first time renewal rates in 2020. We had more demand coming out of more mature markets like the U.S. and EMEA which had higher renewal rates. And so those names, obviously, last year are the ones that are renewing this year. And so you're seeing a slightly higher renewal rate trend this year compared to last year. Because the first time and the previous renewed rates are increasing because of the mix. And that's been consistent both in the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. Sterling Auty : And when you look at the renewal rate for means renewing for the first time, other than kind of China, which typically has lower rates. Has anything changed in those kind of first time renewal rates? George Kilguss : Again, they vary by country. Our first time renewal rates are still around 50% and our previous renewed rate is still around the mid-80s, 85%-86% range. Sterling Auty : All right. Great. And then finally, when we talked about hypothetically if you were to go live with .web post that process, the timing to revenue. How should we think about when either technology investment or any type of incremental infrastructure or any marketing programs would actually go into effect under that scenario? Jim Bidzos : So Sterling, I guess, it's a bit early to speculate specifically. I know you hadn't asked specifically about revenue. But what I can say to you is that, first of all, .web is, of course, different from .com and net and that it's not a price controlled TLD. And I think at this point, it's just really too early to speculate how revenue would roll in or what it would look like. But we do have flexibility with it that we don't have - we would have flexibility with it that we don't have with other TLDs, and premiums are available. Other sorts of options are available. The infrastructure that we have is in a sense since we operate multiple TLDs.web is in a sense another TLD. But there certainly will be some sort of marketing launch that will occur, but I just think it's too early to really talk about what that would look like and what the expense impact will be. But we certainly intend to market and promote .web. Our plan, our desire, as we've stated - and I'll say again, is to offer our customers more choice and to make .web a very successful TLD. Sterling Auty : Make sense. Thank you, guys. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. We appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, Operator. Welcome to VeriSign's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO.

GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site, available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter and full-year of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. Throughout 2021, we delivered strong financial results, while continuing to strengthen our critical internet infrastructure. We complied with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements, and extend our record of .com and .net DNS available to over 24 years. I would like to thank our team for their dedicated efforts and expertise which enabled us to realize these results. The critical infrastructure we operate provides the domain name system navigation service, which people around the world increasingly depend on for commerce, education, healthcare, and person-to-person connection. For the full-year 2021, we processed 44.6 million new registrations, and delivered revenue of [$1,328 million] [Ph] while generating free cash flow of $754 million. During the full-year of 2021, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for $700 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for share repurchase of VeriSign common stock by approximately $705 million, to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program which has no expiration. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business, and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 173.4 million, consisting of 160 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net, with a year-over-year growth rate of 5%. Looking at fourth quarter operational results, we processed 10.6 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.37 million names. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 will be approximately 74.8%. This preliminary rate compares to 73.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020, and 75% in the third quarter. As we look to 2022, we expect the domain name base to grow at a rate of between 2.5% and 4.5%. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.58 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names, which raises the price from $8.39 to $8.97, effective September 1, 2022. I should point out that anyone can register a .com domain at any time before September 1 for up to 10 years, and lock in that price for the full term, of up to 10 years. Turning to .web, we noted last time that affiliates had filed an application for reconsideration of the May 2021 final decision, which, as a reminder, rejected their request to be awarded .web. Since we last spoke with you, the significant development, in December, was that affiliates' application for reconsideration was also rejected. And further, affiliates was sanctioned for filing it because the arbitration panel found that it was \"frivolous\". Since then, in mid January, ICANN's Board of Directors directed one of its standing committees to review the panel's final decision and provide the Board with its findings. With the rejection of affiliates' application and the reaffirmation of the panel's final decision, those roadblocks are now out of the way. And ICANN looks to be moving forward with making the decision on the delegation of .web, and we will be monitoring their process. As we have said before, we continue to look forward to becoming the .web registry operator and establishing it alongside .com and .net as an additional option for businesses and individual end users worldwide. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year-ended December 31, 2021, the company generated revenue of [$1,328 million] [Ph], up 4.9%, and delivered operating income of $867 million, up 5.2% from 2020. Operating expense totaled $461 million, and was up 4.5% from the prior year. The full-year 2021 operating margin was 65.3%, and free cash flow was $754 million. For the fourth quarter, revenue came to $340 million, up 6.3% from the same quarter in 2020, with operating income of $222 million, up 8.6% from $205 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $118 million for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $113 million in the third quarter, and $116 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The sequential increase was primarily a result of increased marketing spend in the quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was 65.3%, compared to 66.2% in the third quarter, and 63.9% for the same quarter of 2020. Net income totaled $330 million, compared to $157 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.97 in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to $1.38 for the same quarter of 2020. As noted in our earning release today, net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 included the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit related to a restructuring of two of our international subsidiaries, which involved the transfer of certain non-U.S. intellectual property between these subsidiaries. The recognition of this deferred income tax benefit increased net income by $165.5 million, and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.49 in the quarter. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 included the recognition of $12.4 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.11. As we noted in the fourth quarter of 2020 earnings release, for 2022, we expect our GAAP effective tax rates to be between 21% and 24%. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $206 million, and free cash flow was $193 million, compared with $195 million and $189 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2020. Starting with our first quarter financial statements, we will combine our sales and marketing and general administrative operating expense lines into one SG&A line to better align with peer-company reporting. In addition, any significant fluctuations in sales and marketing would continue to be disclosed within our new SG&A section of our MD&A, contained in our filings. I'll now discuss our full-year 2022 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1,420 million to $1,440 million. This revenue range reflects the domain name base growth expectation of between 2.5% and 4.5% that Jim mentioned earlier, as well as the impact of the .com price increase announced today. The operating margin is expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. Interest expense and non-operating income net is expected to be an expense of between $70 million to $75 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. As mentioned, the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 24%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2022 to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and for the full-year 2021. And we look forward to continuing our focused execution. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. Before we open the call for your questions, I'd like to update you, as I've done in previous quarters, on some of our activities in the field of corporate citizenship under our VeriSign Cares program, which aims to make a positive and lasting impact on the global internet community and the communities in which we live and work. During the fourth quarter, we once again joined forces with food banks in the areas where we have a footprint to help alleviate seasonal and COVID related food and security. We also renewed for a further year, our partnership with Virginia Ready, the launch partner of our initiative to help those whose employment has been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to access retraining and other assistance to find new jobs in the growing technology sector. And finally in Q4, we made a further contribution to the Equal Justice Initiative, recognizing that there remains much to be done in the important area of racial and social justice. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So, now that you've taken the second price increase, I know it's kind of a, what have you done for me lately question, but how should we think about the final two price increases that you still have left? And probably just as important, what happens after the six-year period of this contract? Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks for that question, Sterling. For those of you on the call, who may not be familiar with the structure, refer to in the question, let me just briefly cover that if I might. So, every six-year periods, we are allowed four price increases in the back four years that we are in the first six-year period, which began in October of 2018. And we're now at the point where we have today announced effective September 1 of this year, the second of the four allowable price increases. And so, in this period, we don't guide to pricing. So, today's announcement is, of course, for an increase in COM domain registrations that begins September 1, 2022. Beyond that announcement, we don't guide the future pricing or discuss the factors that that go into those decisions. I will say this. This is the second wholesale price increase for COM since January of 2012. So, if you look back over the last 10 years, that translates into a cost increase of only 1.3% CAGR over the last ten and a half years actually. And so, I just wanted to point that out. For the second part of your question, so basically in 2020, eight years from 2018, and -- Sorry, six years from 2018 to 2024, we will start a second six-year period. This is a six-year period, that's part of our cooperative agreement with the Commerce Department, which automatically renews every six years. And as you may or may not know or recall, the first two years do not allow for price increases. So, in fact, without guiding to what we'll do in the future, if you assume that we take if we took all of the four price increases, meaning the remaining two in this six-year period, as far out as till at least October of 2026, the price of a .com registration cannot exceed $10.26. And we believe COM is and continues to be positioned competitively. So, without guiding, we're in a six-year period in which we've taken the first two of four. And then, we'll start a second six-year period. And since the increases are only in the back four years, none could come in the first two. So, just to reiterate, COM is -- currently the current price increase that we've taken allows for two more if we were to take those two more and exit the six-year period at $10.26. That price couldn't change until at least October of 2026. And that was a long answer. Hopefully that's helpful. Sterling Auty : Yes, it is helpful. I appreciate that. And then, within the context of the initial guide you're giving here for '22 for the domain name growth of the 2.5% to 4.5%, I think there's a lot of us that have watched the data year-to-date and we're just in the very beginning. But any comments you give, do you feel like the base is off to a slower than normal start for the year, and is there timing of renewals or other things that investors should be thinking about and how that factored into your guide? Jim Bidzos : Sure. George? George Kilguss : Yes, sure. Thanks, Jim. Yes, Sterling this is George. So, I would just remind you and others on the call that we do had some seasonality as it relates to certain holidays and how they fall on the calendar. This year in Q1 for example, the Chinese New Year is about two weeks earlier, started on February 1. Last year, it was February 12. And we tend to see new registrations from our Chinese registrar slowdown a few weeks before the actual holiday and then recover once the holiday is over. So, that could be playing into some of the data that you see on our Web site. But overall, as you mentioned, we do expect continued growth in the domain name base. We have got it to 2.5% to 4.5%. And if we recall, that was a similar growth rate that we got into last year at this time as well. Sterling Auty : It makes sense. And then, very last one on .web, if all goes well with ICANN Board, is it your anticipation that you would be in the market selling .web domains in '22? Jim Bidzos : Yes. Well, so first of all, the process that I mentioned that was directed by ICANN Board, that is a process that's been held up for many years during litigation, which the panel has now basically shutdown for the second time and directed ICANN to move with this process. So, we're pleased to see ICANN doing it. That is ICANN's process. So, I can't speak quite for the duration that will take. Obviously, we hope it's as brief as it can be. But that is an ICANN process. And secondly, I think you're aware there are some standard processes that are associated with the launch of any TLD. There's a period where some security issues are observed and addressed. There's a period where trademark holders are given the right to make their registrations first. So, putting all that together, it's really hard to speculate in a way that allows me to answer your question. I will say that we have not budgeted in 2022, any launch or marketing costs, or any revenue for .web. We'd certainly like to be in the market if we could, but I think given all of those variables that it isn't helpful for me to speculate as to whether it plays exactly when or even what timeframe as you asked web will come to market. We hope it does soon, and we certainly intend to bring it to market and be successful with it, but beyond that, I don't think I can speculate. Sterling Auty : It makes sense. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Rob Oliver of Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon, Sterling asked a lot of good questions, I'll just follow-up on his. So, just I'll start with .web since Jim that's where you left off. You did mention in your prepared remarks that you're going to be monitoring the process at ICANN, I just want to understand what's the vehicle, who's actually doing that, how you monitor that? And then, I feel you used to say, rattling about further legal actions, and I'm just wondering from your perspective, what exactly that is like, what avenues they have left. They've been able to stretch this out for so long. And then I had a follow-up for George as well. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Well, I can't speak for affiliates, I can only tell you that the result of their last application was sanctioned, and a use of the word, \"Frivolous\" in the panel's answer to their application in reiterating their earlier finding, which is to direct ICANN to proceed. In terms of how we monitor that, most of these actions that when ICANN's Board takes these actions, that information is publicized, and so you can follow some of that on ICANN's Web site. For example, the route -- the results that I mentioned, the direction that ICANN gave to one of their standing committees was in fact, publicly available information. So, what we'll be monitoring, and you can certainly monitor yourself on ICANN's Web site as the Board proceeds. So, I think beyond that, again, I can't really speak for affiliates, we blogged about this, you can find our blogs and you can see our position, we've been firm from the beginning that we believe that affiliates' claims and demands were without merit. Thus far the panel has reaffirmed what we expected what happened that ICANN would be directed to proceed with its process and determine the delegation of that web. That's where we are now. What affiliates will do next? If anything is up to them. But at this point, ICANN has taken some action and we're monitoring that. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. That's helpful Jim. Thank you. And then, George, just a couple quick ones for you, just on the operating margin guide for '22 assuming and I think you guys have, in the past never included things in guide that weren't -- assuming that guide does not include .web, and assuming you got .web, there would be some expenses associated with that. I'm not asking you to speculate on exactly what those expenses would be as Jim already said, that you guys wont, but instead could we understand that the initial operating margin guide may then have to be adjusted at some point, if we were -- you guys were to then get .web and proceed with some of the expenses around ramping .web? George Kilguss : Yes, Rob. To the extent that when .web comes to us, clearly, we've got our plan and our launch in place. We clearly provide updated guidance to the extent that those expenses, annual revenue are going to impact the current year. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. And then, just lastly, just -- you mentioned some of the kind of vagaries around global domain trends and Chinese New Year, of course, and just was wondering for about any sort of geographic color and again, a follow-up on Sterling's question just about kind of what you're seeing here early in the year and I know, renewal rates has been higher because of some of the activity that you guys have seen in U.S. and EMEA and how that is trending and how that looks to you here as well? Thanks. George Kilguss : Yes, sure. Rob. So, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks that we had a solid year of growth in the domain name base, it was up 5% year-over-year, and in 2021, we saw big gains in the base primarily from our U.S., EMEA and our Asia Pacific registrar's. When you look at new units, or gross ads, Jim mentioned we generated $44.6 million in 2021. That was up about 2 million units year-over-year. And that increase is similar to the 2 million new unit increase that we experienced in 2019. And the 2 million unit increase we also experienced in 2020. So, we've had pretty good consistent demand growth over the last few years. From a new unit perspective, we saw gains in 2021 from registrar's and EMEA, Asia Pacific and China. And we'll provide more color as we come out of here in 2021 as to the trends that we're seeing in the regions at that time. Rob Oliver : Great. We're going to get at Super Bowl. I mean, we're going to be watching that. That's what I'm going to be watching for the .com, right, and hopefully we get one of those this year. Thank you, guys. George Kilguss : Thank you, Rob. Operator : And so, that concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to David Atchley for any final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Again, that does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Recording of this call is not permitted, unless preauthorized. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me are; Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call. The presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today\u2019s call and the matters we will be discussing today, include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. As global reliance on online services continues to increase, so does the importance of delivering uninterrupted and accurate DNS resolution. Our focus remains on operating, protecting and enhancing our critical internet infrastructure. And I thank all of our employees who continuously execute our complex mission. I\u2019m pleased to report another solid quarter of financial and operational performance for VeriSign. Revenues grew 7.2% year-over-year, while EPS grew 7.5% year-over-year. At the end of March, the domain name base and .com and .net totaled 174.7 million domain names, consisting of 161.3 million names for .com and 13.4 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 4%. During the first quarter, we processed 10.2 million new registrations, and the domain name base increased by 1.23 million names. The final renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 74.8% compared to 73.5% for the same quarter of 2020. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2022 will be approximately 75.9%. This preliminary renewal rate compares to 76% achieved in the first quarter of 2021 and 74.8% last quarter. We continue to see growth in the domain name base and demand for our \u2013 domain names. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, we have seen lower new units in the first quarter as a result of a combination of factors. These include the component of growth attributable to the pandemic which appears to have subsided, as well as recent global macroeconomic factors. For calendar 2022, we now expect the domain name base growth rate of between 1.75% and 3.5%. This updated range reflects the various trends we currently see in our business and our expectation for continued domain name base growth. Our financial and liquidity position remains stable with $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the first quarter totaled $196 million for 895,000 shares. At quarter end, $893 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Turning to .web. As we noted on our last call, ICANN\u2019s Board directed one of its standing committees to review the independent review panel\u2019s final decision and provide the Board with its findings. We understand that process is ongoing and we don\u2019t have any additional information to provide at this time. As we have said before, we continue to look forward to becoming the .web registry operator and establishing it alongside .com and .net as an additional option for businesses and individual end users worldwide. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to George. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31st, 2022, the company generated revenue of $347 million, up 7.2% from the same quarter of 2021 and delivered operating income of $225 million, up 6.8% from $210 million in the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense totaled $122 million, compared to $118 million last quarter, and $113 million for the first quarter a year ago. The year-over-year increase in operating expense is primarily a result of continued investments in personnel and infrastructure. The operating margin in the quarter was 64.8%, compared to 65% for the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $158 million, compared to $150 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.43 for the first quarter of 2022, compared to $1.33 for the same quarter of 2021. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $207 million, and free cash flow was $200 million, compared with $198 million and $192 million, respectively for the first quarter of 2021. I\u2019ll now discuss our updated full year 2022 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.420 billion to $1.435 billion. This narrowed revenue range guidance reflects the updated domain name base growth rate expectation of between 1.75% and 3.5% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is still expected to be between 64.5% and 65.5%. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates is now expected to be an expense of between $65 million to $70 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $35 million to $45 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 22% and 25%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2022 to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2022. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. During the first quarter, we continued our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while continuing our focus on providing long-term value to our shareholders. In closing, I want to acknowledge again, the team here at VeriSign for their hard work in maintaining and operating our critical internet infrastructure, even while facing the challenges of working under pandemic conditions. In particular, I want to acknowledge the group of employees who have worked on-site continually throughout the pandemic in order to continue our infrastructure functions. And now, we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go ahead and take the question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. So Jim, I\u2019ll start with just you know the obvious changes in the macro environment which have caused you guys to make the adjustments that you\u2019ve made here today relative to domain. So, let me just first ask for, you know just a bit more color around Q1. Obviously a lot has happened in a short period of time. So would love to hear what you saw and how that was manifest in your decision to take down the range? Jim Bidzos : Sure. Thanks, Rob. Thanks for the question. First of all, there are a lot of factors that have influenced the changes here that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re still analyzing many of them. But we do believe that the underlying drivers of domain name demand remain positive for our business. As I stated earlier, we continue to see growth in the domain name base, we see demand for our domain names. And while there these many factors that drive demand, we have seen lower new units in the first quarter. As a result of a combination of factors which as I mentioned, in particular, include this component of growth that is \u2013 attributable to the pandemic, that appears to have subsided, and there are recent global macroeconomic factors as well, those obviously we\u2019re still analyzing. We also have heard from some of our registrars that they\u2019re seeing the same thing we are, meaning that incremental demand for new registrations that grew during the pandemic appears to be subsiding. It\u2019s difficult to predict how the changes in these and other trends will impact demand for new registrations and growth in our domain name base, we do expect that new registrations in the second half of the year will be similar with the levels we saw during the second half of last year. Hopefully that helps. Rob Oliver : Yeah, that\u2019s helpful. You touched a little bit. My follow-up was going to be on sort of that geographic makeup of that comment as well. I know you did say that played an element, meaning the war, I was in Europe this quarter you know marketing to investors and it was you know the exposure to the war over there you know was noticeably more acute than here in the US. And it just you know I know you said you\u2019re still analyzing those factors, but any color around sort of the geographic makeup of what you saw this quarter would be helpful. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Let me ask George to comment on it first. But let me directly address one specific part of your question. I mean there are ICANN accredited registrars based in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. But the revenue from those three countries combined is not material to the company\u2019s financials. So with that, I\u2019ll invite George to add any comments or color. George Kilguss : Yes, thanks, Jim \u2013 Rob Oliver : [Technical difficulty] so thank you. George Kilguss : Yeah. So, Rob you know as Jim mentioned in his remarks, we continue to grow our domain name base in the first quarter, we were above 4% year-over-year. Again, in the first quarter, we saw gains in the base primarily from the US, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. From a new unit perspective, you know we generated 10.2 million of new units in the first quarter. And that compared to 10.6 million in the fourth quarter and 11.6 million in the first quarter a year ago. When you look sequentially, we saw continued growth in the US and Asia Pacific regions, with slowing growth in most other regions that we participate in. Year-over-year, we saw more of a broad-based slowing of growth. And as Jim mentioned, that\u2019s really a result of the incremental demand from pandemic that appears to have subsided here. And additionally as Jim mentioned, we also believe the global macroeconomic conditions has also impacted our growth rates here in 2022. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. Yeah that \u2013 George, that\u2019s helpful. So just in terms of the assumptions that went into then to that estimate you know is \u2013 are you guys \u2013 did you guys make any assumptions relative to you know kind of the state of the war or the state of the geopolitical environment? Or is it you know status quo assumed in the forecast for the rest of the year? Jim Bidzos : Rob, I think it\u2019s kind of too early to say. We\u2019re studying all those things to the extent we\u2019ll be able to, in any sort of granular manner, factor them in to that level of specificity, we\u2019ll share with you when and if we do, but I think it\u2019s early at this point, we do you know, the guidance that we gave does plan for a certain amount of uncertainty, which I think is obvious every business is doing that these days. These are you know global, geopolitical \u2013 macroeconomic events that are difficult to predict and obviously things that we can\u2019t control. So, all I can tell you is that, you know those are factored in big based on the best information and analysis that we\u2019re able to make today. Rob Oliver : Got it, got it. Okay. And just a couple more for me guys. I appreciate it. You know, Jim while I have you on the \u2013 just the topic of just a lot of chatter about cyber war, I mean, you guys made some additional investments a couple of years ago around security and you know security is very much at the DNA of what you do. And you guys made those investments ahead of you know that large significant number of federal hack which you know kind of the impression, but just curious you know, it looks you know while everybody\u2019s reporting now they deal with cyber war could be the next round of the war. And if you can just refresh us on you know with the security and how prepared you guys are for that and if in fact you guys have seen anything to-date that would be supportive of those assertions in the press. Jim Bidzos : That\u2019s a tough one for me to comment on with any specificity. We generally don\u2019t talk about these things. I can say in general, that obviously we make certain assumptions about the cyber threat environment. We monitor it very, very closely. We think it varies and we think it\u2019s in a higher state than it has been in the past. But we have in the recent couple of years and in particular, in 2020 and 2021, made some investments in our infrastructure and cybersecurity in general, we continue to make those that\u2019s obviously job one. We take nothing for granted. We generally err greatly on the side of caution and precaution. So we are prepared on assumptions that I don\u2019t want to go into detail on, I\u2019m just \u2013 let\u2019s just say that we\u2019re continuing to make investments. We\u2019ve made investments in providing the equipment and protection for our teams that are working at home. We constantly make investments to protect, evolve and strengthen our infrastructure and its resilience and reliability. And again, that is job one that\u2019s first and foremost that takes a backseat to nothing at this company. That\u2019s probably all I can say about that. Hope that\u2019s helpful. Rob Oliver : Yep, that is helpful. And I appreciate. Yeah you\u2019d be limited on that. One or two other quick ones and appreciate the opportunity here to hold the floor. Just and I know you mentioned, Jim in your formal remarks that there is no update or official update on .web. You know I know you also said in the last call that you guys would be you know monitoring the process. So you know I guess a bit of a nuanced question there. But you know in the absence of any official update, was there anything that you guys picked up in the process that you know that maybe was either not reported or you know from some of your sources that would either leave you to be more optimistic or more concerned or have a better sense of timing? Jim Bidzos : I believe we have no other information than what you can get from ICANN\u2019s website. We \u2013 when we monitor, we\u2019re monitoring ICANN\u2019s public statements on its website. So you\u2019ve seen everything that we\u2019ve seen. And as I said you know they have assigned to one of their committees the task of executing on what the IRP assigned them to do and that seems to be ongoing and you\u2019ll know something as soon as we do. Rob Oliver : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Last one for me. Just, George for you just on the SG&A this quarter, can you just remind us a little bit about some of the components and there was you know caught up a little bit and just wanted to get a sense for what was driving that? George Kilguss : Yeah, sure, Rob. So sequentially you saw that our expenses were up about $3.8 million in total. And that was really due to a combination of factors, primarily increased labor as well as some of the flow through costs from the investments in cybersecurity and infrastructure made last quarter that Jim mentioned. Also in the first quarter, we tend to have higher employee payroll taxes and stock-based compensation as our performance-based plans are really measured and awarded in the first quarter. Rob Oliver : Got it. Great. Well, thank you guys very much. I appreciate it. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, Rob. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. Mr. Atchley, I\u2019d now turn the conference back over to you for any additional remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you.

Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. As global reliance on online services continues to increase, so does the importance of delivering uninterrupted and accurate DNS resolution. Last week we crossed a significant milestone by marking 25 years of uninterrupted uptime for the .com/.net domain name resolution system. Reaching this quarter century mark is a testament to the ongoing investments made in our platforms, processes and people. During the second quarter we grew our revenues by 6.8% year-over-year and our EPS by 17% year-over-year. At the end of June the domain name base and .com and .net totaled 174.3 million domain names consisting of 161.1 million names for .com and 13.2 million names for .net with a year-over-year growth rate of 2.2% and a sequential decrease of 354,000 domain names. The final renewal rate for the first quarter of 2022 was 75.9% compared to 76.0% for the same quarter of 2021. Although renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2022 will be approximately 73.6%. This preliminary renewal rate compares to 75.4% achieved in the second quarter of 2021 and 75.9% last quarter. The decline in the second quarter of preliminary renewal rate is primarily related to the proportion of names renewing from China registered in the year ago quarter which weighed on first time renewal rates. We do see continued strength in the renewal rates of previously renewed names. In the second quarter we processed 10.1 million new registrations compared to 10.2 million last quarter and 11.7 million in the year ago quarter. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, we have seen lower new units in the first half of this year as a result of the few factors that I will now mention. These include a pandemic driven acceleration of domain name registrations in 2020 and 2021, which has subsided, recent global macroeconomic headwinds and relative weakness in 2022 registrations from China. While we're still early in Q3, we do see some signs with new registrations are stabilizing and we continue to see strong renewal rates. However, we agree with the consensus view that the current economic conditions are likely to prevail through 2022 and possibly beyond. Therefore, we're adjusting our 2022 domain guidance and now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 0.5% and 1.5%. This range reflects our expectations that new registrations in Q3 and Q4 will be roughly similar to the levels we saw in the first half of 2022, and which are similar to pre-pandemic levels. This range also reflects our expectations for an improving renewal rate from the preliminary renewal rate we are seeing in Q2. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.90 to the annual wholesale price for .net domain names, which will raise the price from $9.2 to $90.92 effective February 1st, 2023. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $997 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchase 2 million shares for $349 million. At quarter end $543 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. We continually evaluate the overall liquidity and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. Turning to .web as we noted in our last call, ICANN\u2019s Board directed one of its standing committees to review the independent review process panel's final decision and provide the Board with its findings. The committee then asked the parties to submit written summaries of their claims by July 29th, that's tomorrow, and then to submit responses by August 29th. We expect that the committee will conduct its review based on these submissions and will then provide its findings to the ICANN Board. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I will return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks, including more about our areas of focus going forward. George? George Kilguss : Thanks Jim and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the company generated revenue of $352 million up 6.8% from the same quarter of 2021 and delivered operating income of $236 million up 10.8% from $213 million in the same quarter, a year ago. Operating expense totaled $116 million, down $6 million compared to last quarter and flat compared with the second quarter a year ago. While we remain focused on driving profitable growth and optimizing our expenses, the sequential decrease in operating expense is primarily a result of the timing of expenses with slightly lower benefit and performance based compensation accruals in the quarter. The operating margin in the quarter was 67.1% compared to 64.7% for the same quarter a year ago. Net income totaled $167 million compared to $148 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.54 for the second quarter of 2022, compared to $1.31 for the same quarter of 2021. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $145 million and free cash flow was $139 million compared with $143 million and $125 million respectively for the second quarter of 2021. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2022 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.415 billion to $1.430 billion. This updated revenue range guidance reflects our domain name base growth rate expectation between 0.5% and 1.5% that Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 65.25% and 66.25%. This increased range reflects our ongoing focus on expenses while recognizing that the second quarter operating expense run rate was lower than the run rate we are expecting for the second half of 2022. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates is now expected to be an expense of between $62 million to $67 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $30 million to $40 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22% and 25%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2022 to also be within this same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2022. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thanks George. There's little, if any disagreement in the statements made by many tech company leaders over the last few weeks on economic conditions. They expect the uncertainty they see today to continue for the foreseeable future. This macroeconomic uncertainty was a factor that influenced our revised domain base growth guidance. While we can't do much to change the pace of economic recovery from the pandemic or the geopolitical and macroeconomic events and forces that contribute to the downturn, we can and we will focus on what is within our ability, managing our business with the unconditional prioritization of delivering on our mission. This includes exercising careful and responsible expense management, some of which is evident in our Q2 results reported today, announcing as described earlier, a price increase for .net registrations, which we have held flat for five years, identifying and pursuing new growth opportunities such as .web, safely transitioning our teams to a new hybrid and flexible work environment which is currently underway, working to ensure VeriSign remains a company that will attract and retain top talent, and continually evaluating and optimizing our efforts to efficiently return value to our shareholders. This focus on what we can manage will continue to service well for the long-term success of the business. In closing, we're confident that the long-term fundamentals of our business are unchanged and remain strong. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Mr. Rob Oliver. Your line is open, please go ahead. Rob Oliver : Great. Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So Jim, first one for you, just with domains decreasing here in Q2, can you talk a little bit about what that means for the business in a medium to longer term view? And then I want to dig in on some of the factors that have impacted that as well, that you cited. James Bidzos : Okay, thanks. Good question. Well first let me say that with respect to the sequential decrease while infrequent, this isn't the first time we've seen a sequential decrease in a domain name base after an acceleration of registrations in the prior year. The last time we saw it several years ago within a few quarters registrations have normalized. So we're keeping an eye on the current situation with that precedent in mind. What we did see is an acceleration of the domain name base growth rate during the pandemic in 2020 and much of 2021. That acceleration demand has now subsided. I mentioned last quarter that one of the factors to consider is that in our Q1 earnings was the component of growth attributable to the pandemic had subsided. This is confirmation that that is what we are seeing in 2020 and 2021. The accelerated demand has now subsided. So we're seeing the year-over-year growth rate slow as a result. However, if we look at the longer term trend, we're seeing that the current pace of new registrations look more similar to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, renewal rates are strong and remained strong. So while there's broad macroeconomic uncertainty, we don't see any change in the underlying fundamental long-term drivers that we think are positive for our business and there continues to be demand for domain names. Rob Oliver : And on that, on the renewal rates what is it that gives you guys the confidence that the renewal rates will remain strong? Is it something geographic, anything else you're seeing there would be helpful? James Bidzos : Yes, sure. So we have seen a slight decline in the first time renewal rates in the quarter, but that's due to a higher proportion of names renewing from China this quarter. So what we do see though, is a continued strong renewal rate for previously renewed names. The previously renewed rate has stayed in the mid 80% range and it's actually improved over time. And additionally, as a larger portion of the base becomes previously renewed, that trend helps the overall renewal rate. We're also seeing the cohort of names related to the accelerated demand that I referred to during the pandemic, those names are renewing at strong rates. Those additional names have been positive for the business. So that's a strong point that underlines our confidence going forward in the core strength of the business renewal rates in particular. Rob Oliver : Got it, got it. And that cohort that you're talking about, Jim, is that a north American cohort, in other words, those that got domains for the first time now emerging from the pandemic are renewing? James Bidzos : Well, I think those are broad modular to use a math term that modular the Chinese names that we had from the year ago quarter, which tend to renew at a lower first time renewal rate. So the remaining are not limited to north America. No real geographic specificity there. I think those are geographically very broad and those renewal rates are strong, yes. So those are quality names. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay, very helpful. And on the timing of the .net price increase, I just would love to hear your reasoning behind the timing. It comes at a bit of a curious time. On the one hand, you guys have not raised prices there, as you mentioned for five years on the other it hasn't been particularly strong and just wondering if you could walk us through understanding why now and help to get a better sense of that? James Bidzos : Well, we've as you know, back in 2020 in the early stages of the pandemic, we froze all of our TLDs, including .net. .net\u2019s current level, unchanged level of pricing without price increases does go back five years. We study the market and we make those decisions. There's nothing specific to the current conditions that that that decision is based on. It's just a result of our studying the market. .net still represents lot of value. The other so-called legacy TLDs are all priced slightly above .net, so it's very competitive in a market. And as you noted, the price increase takes effect February 1st of next year. Rob Oliver : Got it. Got it, okay. And on .web, you, you touched on it and I'm not sure that there's more that you can say, but this labyrinthine and seemingly unending process is now in another phase. So I guess by your comments, we could, I guess, infer that you guys have filed or will be filing by tomorrow everything that was requested here in the quarter in terms of both parties having to like resubmit all of their material. Was there anything new that was asked of you guys and then any other comment around potential timing on .web would be helpful? James Bidzos : Okay. Let me parse that a little bit. So yes, we certainly will make our filing on time tomorrow, no doubt about that. And yes, you you're right, this is a slightly different part of the process. I think it might be fair to characterize everything that's gone up, gone on until now, basically a process that was held in front of the IRP panel, the Independent Review Process panel, which is sort of a close, close to arbitration, form of arbitration. That panel made its ruling and sent it back to ICANN and had ICANN make a decision. ICANN took the step in a board meeting earlier this year to direct this existing committee to address the issue and follow the instructions of the panel, which is for ICANN to decide these issues. Their process, that committee that's assigned the task of resolving this issue asked for these filings, so of course will make ours. So we are in a stage where ICANN has now at the direction of the panel after years of litigation, then given the responsibility to resolve these issues, these are, this is all tied to ICANN policies and procedures, and they're going about it in this manner. So we're hopeful that we're in a different phase and we're optimistic that there are some assigned timeframes here, we'll certainly comply with them. As to any details of our filing or anything of that nature, that this is a pending legal process, so obviously we won't make any comments on that. But we've always said that we look forward to being the registry operator for .web. We see it as an opportunity to introduce a new TLD and offer our customers more choice. That is unchanged. I think at this point it's in ICANN\u2019s hands and they have a process and we look very much forward to hearing from them. Rob Oliver : Okay, great. That's, that's helpful, Jim. George, I had one for you. You did mention that operating expenses were lower in the quarter, and that was due to the timing of certain expenses. Is that normal course timing or can you talk a little bit about what, if any of the expenses varied and I know you suggested or said that expenses would return back to the normal run rate in the back half of the year, but if you could just help us understand a little bit more about what went into that variability? George Kilguss : Yes, sure Rob. We do have some programs that we try to execute in a year and sometimes those slip a little bit. I would say those were more of a minor case. The larger components really were related to lower benefit and performance based compensation accruals in the quarter. As you know, we're or maybe you don't know, we're self-insured for a number of benefits and our expenses related to some of our healthcare expenses came in lower in the quarter. Rob Oliver : Okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Last question, Jim, I'll just come back to you. I mean you've been through a lot of different cycles in your career and in some of your commentary and your prepared remarks certainly was at least relatively cautious about the macro. And, but just would love to hear a little bit more about what it is you're seeing, what data sets you're watching. I know you cited some of the commentary of other tech companies that gives you that, aside from the actual kind of numbers, what gives you that more cautious bent and how you think this might play out? James Bidzos : Yes, well, you're right. I referred to comments that other tech leaders have made just simply to point out that we're in sort of an unprecedented situation here economically. I mean, there's obviously a lot going on. I just wanted to separate that from things that we really can't directly impact the things that we can't control. I guess another way to look at it is to say again what I said last quarter that I don't want to trivialize the pandemic and there's absolutely no intent to do that, but we do see this as a bump in the road in the long-term effort to build this business. That's what our efforts are really about. We have our eye on the long-term and it's unchanged. There's certainly some uncertainty and we factored it in. But to your question about the confidence we have or the guidance or other things that we said, well, first of all we have three months more data. We have a substantial amount of data. We track a tremendous amount of data, not just about the zone, but other things. But some of those other macroeconomic factors, I mean, obviously there's a bit of a slowdown in things like online advertising and ecommerce. And those are certainly factors that impact domain names. So there's consideration given to those factors that maybe we can't control, but we recognize them and we make some assessments about them. But in terms of our own zone, we have a lot of data, and that certainly plays a huge role in putting our forecasts and guidance together. And I'll just reiterate again, that our confidence in the fundamentals of our business is strong. The business is strong, the renewal rates are strong. We see this, we see, we do expect that things will normalize at some point. We're just being cautious about when that will be, and we're focusing on what we control and that's what I really wanted to focus my final prepared comments on. There are things we can control and we're going to focus on them. And, but we're going to run the business for the long-term. That's absolutely what we're here to do. We're undeterred by everything that's going on in that focus. So I think the intent there was to just make it clear what you can expect from us. Rob Oliver : Great, that's really helpful. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it. James Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : It appears that there is no further the question at this time. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone and welcome to VeriSign\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. Recording of this call is not permitted, unless preauthorized. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter, unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today\u2019s call and the matters we will be discussing today, include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. James Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. Last quarter we acknowledged the uncertainty that macroeconomic and other challenges presented and we said that we would focus on what was within our ability to control. We also indicated what that meant. First, maintaining, operating and investing in our critical infrastructure, next exercising careful expense control where appropriate. Additionally, it meant keeping our capital allocation activities focused on building and efficiently returning long-term shareholder value. During the third quarter, we extended our record of uninterrupted DNS availability for .com and .net to over 25 years. Also, during the third quarter, we grew our revenues by 6.8% year-over-year, and our EPS by 12.9% year-over-year. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $980 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $275 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for share repurchase of VeriSign common stock by approximately 803 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. At the end of September the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 174.2 million domain names with a year-over-year growth rate of 1.2%. In the third quarter, there were 9.9 million new registrations compared to 10.1 million last quarter and 10.7 million in the year ago quarter. And while there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, we have seen lower new registrations in the first three quarters of this year as a result of factors that I have already mentioned in prior calls. These include a pandemic driven acceleration of new registrations in 2020 and 2021, which have subsided, recent global macroeconomic headwinds and reduced new registrations from China. We believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2022 will be approximately 73.8%, same as the 73.8% final renewal rate last quarter, which compares to 75% a year ago. The renewal rate for previously renewed names has remained similar year-over-year, and the first time renewal rates while similar to last quarter are lower year-over-year, predominantly due to a greater proportion of names renewing from China that were registered last year. We do see some signs that new registrations while still slow, continue to stabilize towards pre-pandemic levels. That said, current global economic and geopolitical conditions continue to introduce uncertainty through the remainder of 2022. Because of this macro uncertainty, we are adjusting our 2022 domain name based guidance and now expect a domain name based growth rate of between 0.25% and 1%. Turning to .web, the parties made their submissions to ICANN during Q3 and we are now waiting for ICANN to complete its process. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I'll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter ended September 30, 2022, the company generated revenue of $357 million, up 6.8% and delivered operating income of $237 million, up 7% from the same quarter a year ago. For the first nine months of 2022, revenue is up 6.9% and operating income is up 8.2% as compared with the first nine months of 2021. Operating expense totaled $120 million compared to $113 million a year earlier. For the first nine months of 2022, operating expenses are up 4.5% as compared to the first nine months of 2021. We continue to remain focused on optimizing our expenses and driving long-term profitable growth. Net income totaled $169 million compared to $157 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.58 for the third quarter of 2022 compared to $1.40 for the same quarter of 2021. For the first nine months of 2022, net income is up 8.7% as compared to the first nine months of 2021. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $262 million, and free cash flow was $255 million compared with $260 million and $245 million respectively for the third quarter of 2021. As with Q3 last year, cash flow this quarter benefited from an increase in deferred revenue, which was primarily related to early domain name renewal activity before the .com price increase on September 1, 2022. The main impact of these early renewals is the pulling forward of cash flow from future quarters into the third quarter this year. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2022 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.418 billion to $1.426 billion. This updated revenue range guidance reflects our domain name based growth rate expectation of between 0.25% and 1% as Jim mentioned earlier. The operating margin is now expected to be between 65.75% and 66.25%. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates is now expected to be an expense of between $60 million to $65 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $30 million to $35 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22% and 25%. We expect the cash tax rate for 2022 to also be within the same guidance range. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2022. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. James Bidzos : Thanks, George. As we said last quarter, while the global macroeconomic outlook remains complicated by geopolitics, inflation, and risk of recession, we can and we did focus on what is within our control, managing our business efficiently with the unconditional prioritization of delivering on our mission. This focus on what we can manage will continue to serve all of our constituents well for the long-term, those being our customers, relying parties, employees, and shareholders, you can expect that focus to continue. We're confident that the long-term fundamentals of our business remain strong. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call to your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will go to Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Good afternoon, guys. Jim, thanks for the color, yet I appreciate this is the second quarter in a row where you really kind of laid out the focus on kind of the things that are within your control versus the things that are now within your control. And I'm just curious as you look at those things, if there's been any change since last quarter and if you could remind us of what some of those things in particular are as you see them? James Bidzos : Thanks for the question Rob. Yes, I guess, this is a quarter -- focusing on last quarter, what we did, the things, I think they're fairly simple, but a wise man once said that just because something is simple, doesn't mean it's easy to do. But what we did first and foremost is sort of common sense and obvious, focusing on what you can control. To us, it means not dwelling on these factors that we can't control beyond the need to do proper planning. Second is getting it right, meaning that managing expenses has to be done while continuing to make all the necessary investments in our infrastructure to keep up with an evolving cyber threat environment. And I think the third category is sort of being, about being alert for opportunities to more effectively return value to our shareholders. Now, those are the things we focused on and we're going to continue to focus on. I should add that, in addition to that, I think you have to say that the domain names have an enduring value to users, and that's certainly a contribution to the fundamental strength of this business. It's what gives us confidence in the long-term fundamentals and the value of the business. And another thing we do, I mean, obviously this is a quarterly focus, we report every quarter, but we also at the same time have to keep our eye on the long-term. So we ask ourselves questions like, look when this, I've called it a bump in a road, everything that we're going through right now, COVID and all the other challenges, and it's certainly a longer bump than anybody would like. But we ask ourselves questions like years from now when we look back at getting through this, what will we wish we had done in order to improve the long-term health and fundamentals of our business and I think that helps guide us through these, these things as well. So hopefully that helps a little bit. Rob Oliver : Great, that's helpful. You did make a comment Jim, about some stabilization in the domain base. You know, we've seen some of that in the numbers. You also talked about China. I just wanted to make sure I understood. Was that a general comment relative to domains or was that a China specific comment? And then, I'm just going to ask about geographies that I can ask Todd that one as well, but just curious about that stabilization comment. James Bidzos : Well, let's see. I think it was a general comment that I made. First of all, in general, we did indicate at the last quarterly report that we provided that we saw some indication of trends toward normalization and we did see some of that. We see it again. I think it's a bit difficult to be precise in uncertain times, but I think that was a broad statement about general domain names. But China's a bit different. China is always sort of a unique situation. Domains there and domain investors have their own particular qualities about how they buy domains and how they use them. China has regulations of course, and China had some challenges from COVID. We saw that names that surged early on in China having lower first time renewal rates certainly contributed to some of the data that you saw. But we also saw that many of the pre-pandemic names provided renewal rates that are very similar to the long-term renewal rates. So much of, what we got in a broader sense were high quality names. Rob Oliver : Got it, okay, thanks. And Todd a question for you sort of standard quarterly question just around any geographic trends, I know Jim just talked a little bit about China, which I'd asked about if there was anything else to call out from a geographic perspective relative to renewals or trends. Todd Strubbe : Yes, but most of our regions from a new registrations perspective remained lower year-over-year. So while North America, Europe and China had year-over-year decreases in new registrations, we did see increases in new registrations from registrars in both APAC and Latin America. Rob Oliver : Okay. Okay, that's great. Jim, a couple more for you if I may. You mentioned that you guys had fulfilled the submission to ICANN on .web, feels like one of many submissions you guys have made. Was there anything else other than you guys fulfilling the submission any other communication or anything else that would give an indication to you guys as to what a timeframe might be or anything else you can share there? James Bidzos : Sure. So first of all, let me just say I think this submission was a little bit different in the sense, that the many other submissions that we made were actually to an IRP panel. And this was a submission to ICANN who was now acting on the panel directing them to pursue this through their processes. In fact, in March, early in March, the ICANN Board adopted a resolution that instructed one of their board accountability mechanism committees to evaluate the claims relating to the two parties here, and those submissions were made directly to ICANN. So that's actually different than what we were doing over the past few years in litigation. I just wanted to offer that clarification. So what the conclusion of the IRP did was basically put this back in ICANN's hands, so it's ICANN\u2019s process. We've made our submissions. They have our submissions and so it's an ICANN process and we're just waiting to hear from them when they've concluded. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay, thanks. And then on .net, you guys announced last quarter that you were going to take a price increase in .net and just, I know that's going to roll in here, but just wanted to get a sense if what if any feedback you could share in terms of what you've heard from channel partners or others there around the .net price increase? Todd Strubbe : Well, look, .net continues to be a strong, widely recognized brand and a very competitive global TLD and like .com. It faces strong competition around the world and we continue to invest in it, in the marketing internet and work with our channel to ensure that it's widely recognized and available. So we're looking forward to continue to work with our registrars and our channel on that. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. Okay, helpful. Jim, just one for you, we get this all the time and I just would, but just would love to just surface it again to get it out there. Just questions around political risk to you guys, if there is any at all like a lot of different political winds blowing and in DC and can you just remind us please just what, if any political impact there has ever been for you guys on decisions around the cooperative agreement contract or your ability to continue to fulfill your obligations? James Bidzos : Well, the last action was in October of 2018, which was Amendment 35 to the Cooperative Agreement and sorry, 36, 35. And that amendment provided some regulatory relief as part of a broader effort to transition and global internet, internet governance to turn ICANN into a more global organization and to provide some sort of a regulatory relief to VeriSign in .com that provided apriori approval for VeriSign to enter into agreements to renew .com with ICANN where in the past every six years their specific approval was required. That's now been given apriori and the cooperative agreement. Also that amendment to the Cooperative Agreement also provided for the limited pricing flexibility that we have. And it also provided for different termination of provisions, which are that the Commerce Department has the right to unilaterally sunset the agreement. We do not, they do. But also it's a provision of Amendment 35 that the Cooperative Agreement cannot be amended without approval of both of the parties. So I think you can certainly view that as a move towards sort of depoliticizing this component of the Internet. It came following the 2016 so-called transition of ICANN away from the regulation that that it was governed by, by the U.S. Government. So I think if you see it in that broader context, maybe it makes a little bit more sense. So the last thing that happened with that respect was a move to provide regulatory relief, which I think we certainly benefit from. Rob Oliver : Got it, okay. Yes, that's really helpful. I appreciate you running through that. And then George, just quick one for you on just the impact of FX on dollar denominated purchases. Can you just talk overall about the FX impact that you guys have within your business and anything you're seeing there? George Kilguss : Yes, sure Rob. As you know, we bill all of our registrar customers in U.S. dollars. So we don't have a lot of FX exposure on the income statement. We have a small amount of FX exposure with regard to some expenses. We have employees around the world and we obviously pay them in their local currency, but that's a relatively small amount for us there. Rob Oliver : Got it. Yep, okay, great. That's all from me guys. I really appreciate you taking all the questions. James Bidzos : Great, thanks Rob. Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, Operator. Please call the Investor Relations Department with any follow up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.

Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign : adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. Throughout 2022, we delivered strong financial results while continuing to strengthen our critical Internet infrastructure. We complied with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements and extended our record of .com and .net DNS availability to over 25 years. I'd like to thank our team for their dedicated efforts, which enabled us to realize these results. The critical infrastructure we operate provides to the domain name system navigation service which people around the world depend on for commerce, work from home, education, healthcare and much more. During 2022, we acknowledged the uncertainty that macroeconomic and other challenges beyond our ability to influence presented and we said that we would focus on what was within our ability to control. We also indicated what that meant. First, reliably maintaining operating and investing in our critical Internet infrastructure. Next, exercising careful expense control where appropriate. And additionally, it meant keeping focused on long-term value creation and efficient return of capital. During 2022, revenue grew 7.3% year-over-year and operating income by 8.8% year-over-year. Additionally, shares outstanding at the end of 2022 decreased by 4.8% from those outstanding at the end of 2021. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $980 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. During the full year of 2022, we repurchased 5.5 million shares for $1 billion. At year-end, $859 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. At the end of 2022, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 173.8 million domain names with a year-over-year growth rate of 0.2%. In the fourth quarter, there were 9.7 million new registrations compared to 9.9 million last quarter and 10.6 million in the year ago quarter. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, we saw lower new registrations during 2022 as a result of factors that I've already mentioned in prior calls. These include pandemic-driven acceleration of new registrations in 2020 and 2021 which has subsided, global macroeconomic headwinds, reduced new registrations from China and lower first-time renewal rates. We believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 will be approximately 73.2% compared to the 73.7% final renewal rate last quarter and 74.8% a year ago. For the full year 2022, the renewal rate for previously renewed names remained similar year-over-year. However, first-time renewal rates were lower year-over-year with the largest single driver being names renewing from China, which were registered during 2021. Looking to 2023, our expected 2023 domain name base growth rate is between 0% and 2.5%. This guidance reflects our knowledge about our domain name base, our channel and the broader macroeconomic backdrop. As announced in today's earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.62 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names, which raises the price from $8.97 to $9.59, effective September 1, 2023. Even after this increase, we believe .com will remain highly competitive with other TLD choices. As a reminder, any of our domains may be registered for terms of up to 10 years at the current price. While we do not guide to pricing changes, I can say, as I did last year, that under the limited pricing flexibility we have the wholesale price of a .com registration cannot exceed $10.26 until at least October of 2026. Turning to web. The parties made their submissions to ICANN during Q3 and we are still waiting for ICANN to complete its process.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I will return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the company generated revenue of $1.425 billion, up 7.3% and delivered operating income of $943 million, up 8.8% from 2021. Operating expense totaled $482 million and was up 4.6% from the prior year compared to a similar 4.5% increase experienced in fiscal 2021. The full year 2022 operating margin was 66.2% and free cash flow was $804 million. For the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the company generated revenue of $369 million, up 8.5% from the same quarter of 2021 and delivered operating income of $245 million, up 10.5% from the same quarter a year ago. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we executed a transition of the .tv agreement to a new registry operator. As the proposed contract terms in the new .tv request for proposal, no longer aligned with our strategic framework, we decided not to participate in the RFP. Revenue related to this agreement during the full year of 2022 was approximately $19 million, of which approximately $10 million was recorded in the fourth quarter. Operating expense in Q4 totaled $124 million compared to $118 million a year earlier. Net income in the fourth quarter totaled $179 million compared to $330 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $2.97 for the same quarter of 2021. As a reminder, net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 included the recognition of a deferred income tax benefit related to the transfer of certain non-U.S. intellectual properties between wholly-owned subsidiaries which increased net income by $165.5 million and increased diluted earnings per share by $1.49. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $217 million, and free cash flow was $209 million compared with $206 million and $193 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2021. I will now discuss our full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.485 billion to $1.505 billion. This revenue range reflects our expectation that the domain name base will grow at a rate between 0% and 2.5% as Jim mentioned and is also impacted by the transition of the .tv agreement at the end of 2022. Operating income is expected to be between $985 million and $1.05 billion. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is expected to be an expense of between $35 million to $45 million. Capital expenditures in 2023 are also expected to be in a range between $35 million to $45 million. The GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 22% and 25%.  In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022, and we look forward to continuing our focused execution in 2023. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. We believe our strategic focus and disciplined management served us well during 2022, allowing us to deliver solid financial results in a challenging environment as the economy struggled to recover from disruption caused by the pandemic. VeriSign's mission is about security and stability, not only in the operation of our critical infrastructure, but financial stability is also important for our customers, employees and shareholders. Today, we reported profitable revenue growth for 2022, and we guided to profitable revenue growth for 2023. This was possible through modest domain name base growth, limited pricing flexibility and responsible expense management. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of our business remain strong. As I said earlier, our strategy prioritizes reliable, uninterrupted operation of our critical infrastructure, along with long-term value creation and its efficient return to shareholders with consistent, efficient management. We believe this strategy will serve all of our constituents well for the long term, and you can expect us to maintain this focus. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird. Rob Oliver : Appreciate the opportunity to ask a question. First one for me is, just around the macro, obviously, second half of last year you guys really focused on kind of what you can control operationally, a lot of moving parts in the macro. And I think that, that approach really served you well. Looking out here into '23, also obviously, tremendous amount of moving parts, layoffs, macro uncertainty; on the other hand, China reopening. So just curious if you could add a few finer points to your thoughts relative to the outlook, having seen many cycles as well as to the domain guide that you guys offered of the 0% to 2.5%? And then I had a quick follow-up. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks for that question. Well, first, for 2022, looking back on that year, as soon as we recognize that the pandemic-driven growth was subsiding, we began planning for what I'd called responsible expense control, meaning that, first and foremost, we make all necessary investments in our infrastructure and then look everywhere for efficiencies. As far as layoffs, we did not, as many companies did accelerate hiring during the pandemic-driven growth period. And I would also point out that the average employee tenure at VeriSign is over nine years. So we're fortunate to have a loyal experienced and stable employee base. I should also point out, we also try to take advantage of opportunities to return value to shareholders with more effect as we did in 2022, retiring nearly 5% of our shares outstanding. These are all the parts of our business that we can control. So that's where we focused in '22. Looking forward, we're hearing what you're hearing. Many economists and CEOs talking about 2023 say that the macroeconomic and geopolitical factors suggest some continued uncertainty. I suppose it should be no surprise that the recovery from the pandemic and with all the global impact in '20 and 2021 is going to take more than one year to fully recover. So it seems prudent to factor that uncertainty into our guidance for 2023, which we did. And as far as strategy, what you can expect from us in 2023 is a continuation of our 2022 strategy. It's actually not that different from what we try to do every year. Rob Oliver : Okay. Great. Thanks, Jim. And a bit on the road marketing for the last couple of weeks and particularly in the news now is ChatGPT. And I just wanted to get your thoughts relative to that. It's obviously very early, and we're in the high stage around this new technology now. And we've seen -- I've seen with you guys many times over the years where there have been calls for the demise of the domain. But I just wanted to get your preliminary thoughts relative to ChatGPT and potential risks, it seems to direct people towards information rather than directing them towards websites at least at the outset and just wanted to get your thoughts? Jim Bidzos : Okay. Well, that's an interesting question. Well, first of all, I'll say this. I mean, right now, ChatGPT looks like a very interesting and potentially beneficial thing for us. We are actually looking at it quite closely. We have a product called NameStudio, which we use in some of our channel users to help them when they go to register a domain name, if it's already taken by somebody else, which happens. ChatGPT and NameStudio will actually help you find a similar and equally good or maybe even better name and we're looking closely at the ChatGPT to see about using its capabilities to enhance what NameStudio does. So I see it as actually a benefit to those efforts. I would say, ChatGPT similar. I mean, I guess, at one point, a lot of people said, \"Well, voice assistants are going to replace the DNS\" I just -- that one had me shaking my head. Voice assistants go out and collect data and report it to you. And the data that they collect is found by searching the Internet for the relevant data that they seek. And that's navigated using the DNS. So they're completely complementary. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Ygal Arounian with Citi. Ygal Arounian : Maybe just starting on China. You just mentioned it before a little bit. But given the reopening there and some of the factors, think about some of the puts and takes that are kind of driving -- moving the needle there or impacting your expectations for next year? Jim Bidzos : Well, I guess just -- well, first of all, just understanding. Oh, I'm getting an echo there. Do you hear that? David Atchley : I do. Yes. Jim Bidzos : I don't know if the audience is hearing my echo. I'm hearing it. Seems to be gone now. Operator : Okay. Yes. Please proceed. I just muted the participant's line while you're responding. That's all. Jim Bidzos : Okay. All right. Maybe there was some feedback there. So in 2022, we did see a lot of China names that were registered in 2021, renewing with lower first-time renewal rates. That was a factor in 2022. And also, China, as you know, has treated the pandemic differently. It's somewhat unique in that sense. And those are the factors that contributed to lockdowns, which are ongoing. There's zero COVID policy increased regulation, economic uncertainty, the proportion of names renewing from China that's higher. We mentioned last year that we did see some signs of returning. I think my comments about the -- what -- if there's any consensus about 2023, I think it's that uncertainty still exists and that the recovery is maybe a little bit slower than people thought. So we're sort of just factoring that in. China is certainly part of it. But things are changing in China. I think it's too early to say exactly what that impact will be. But certainly, the economy seems to be moving in a different direction there with some of the COVID restrictions lifting. Maybe after a quarter next quarter, we'll be able to tell you more about what that's doing to the 2023 outlook. And obviously, we'll update our guidance if we see something meaningful that we consider worthy of reporting and representing a trend. At this point, I think it's just too early to say. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Hopefully, not on mute any part, but one more -- can you guys hear me? David Atchley : Yes, we're hearing you. Jim Bidzos : You're not on mute. Go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Okay. So one -- a couple of questions we get on domains. One is, I know the environment was different in the early part of the pandemic. But I get the question on counter cyclicality. We're seeing a lot of layoffs in the tech world right now. And often that can lead to kind of new business formation, people starting projects. Are there any indications of that are you seeing that? Is that factored into your guidance at all? And then the other thing people kind of ask us about regularly is how we think about normalized domain growth going forward, right? We've got some macro headwinds here, but prior to the pandemic, domains were growing at about 4%, plus 5% or let's just call it 4%, growing about 4%. We've been well below that now for duration this year. Our guidance is well below that for next year. How do you guys think about a normalized growth rate for domain? Return back to the levels of pre-COVID? Or are there other factors to think about? Jim Bidzos : Well, let's see. I think there's a couple of questions in there. But I guess, first of all, we -- to answer directly part of your question, we have not tried to assess and factor in the impact of layoffs the new business starts might have, although that is a data point that we do track. I think you can map new business starts going back to 2020 with a fairly good sized jump then. And some elevated activity in 2021, and then you see it declining in 2022. So that does tend to correlate a bit to the domain name activity and registration activity that we saw what.  That's going to mean for the future? I'm not sure it's not a planned part of our guidance for 2023. I will just say, and I'll invite George to comment as well. But we think that the fundamentals of our business and the long-term prospects for the business are fundamentally strong. Domain names are established, have tremendous utility and tremendous value and registrations. We think long-term, it's a great business to be in. We think it will return to pre-pandemic levels. But 2023 is a tricky year to predict. So we haven't gone as far as predicting a return at that point. So I do think, one of the overriding sort of macro factors and all of this is just a complicated longer recovery from COVID than people thought. I think it's pretty clear that we're seeing that some of the ups and downs and the bumps that we're encountering. George, do you want to add anything to that? George Kilguss : The only thing I'd add, Ygal, is that when you look at our business and what we've previously indicated, we look at factors such as Internet adoption, Internet penetration and the growth of e-commerce influencing our business. And I think if you look back during 2020 and 2021, clearly, we saw a lot of those statistics increase significantly. And while they've come down, there's still, I think, a longer growing trend that I think bodes well for domain names. Jim Bidzos : Yes. And I would just add one statistic, one trend is that even the names that we registered in 2020 and 2021 exclusive of some of the China names that are now renewing for the second time or even the third time, are renewing at the traditional previously renewed rate, which is in the mid-80s. So I think that's a good indicator about the long-term strength of the business. Ygal Arounian : Great. That's helpful, and I agree on the trends on e-commerce and all that. Last question. The operating margins, if I'm looking at it correctly, since have come in quite better than where the guidance applied for 4Q. Can you just talk about what is driving that and how that fits into the expense control that we're talking about? Or is it a separate thing? George Kilguss : Yes. Thanks, Ygal. I think a couple of things. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did during the year, it was actually late in the fourth quarter, transition out of .tv management at TLD and in doing so, we -- as we completed all our obligations there, we did recognize about $8.4 million of deferred revenue in the fourth quarter. Again, total revenue for that contract in 2021 was about $19 million. But as Jim mentioned, we -- in the beginning, I would say, in the second quarter, we started looking pretty closely at our expenses and did more responsible management of those expenses, and we were able to get those expenses down. Overall, our expenses grew by about 4.6% this year which is similar to last year. As far as the fourth quarter, we did do a little bit of seasonal marketing more than we had done in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter. And so, some of the increase there sequentially was a result of some of those marketing activities. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and have an excellent day.",

Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report another solid quarter of operational and financial performance for VeriSign. We delivered these results while continuing to strengthen our critical internet infrastructure and complying with the high operational standards required by our ICANN agreements. For the first quarter, revenues grew 5.1% year-over-year, while EPS grew 19% year-over-year. At the end of March, the domain name base .com and .net totaled 174.8 million domain names with a year-over-year growth rate of 0.1%. During the first quarter, the domain name base increased by just over 1 million domain names. From a new registration perspective, the first quarter delivered a modest year-over-year increase with 10.3 million new registrations compared to 10.2 million last year and 9.7 million last quarter. Our renewal rates remain stable. We believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2023 will be approximately 75.6% compared to the 73.3% final renewal rate last quarter and 75.9% a year ago. Having seen modest improvement in the registration trend during Q1, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 0.5% and 2.25% for the full year of 2023. This updated range reflects the current macroeconomic uncertainty and recent trends in our business. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $1.015 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. Share repurchases during the first quarter totaled $220 million for 1.1 million shares. At quarter end, $639 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program which has no expiration. As many of you are aware, we are in the process of renewing the .net registry agreement with ICANN as the current term ends on June 30. Consistent with ICANN's usual process on April 13, ICANN posted the new .net registry agreement for public comment which is open until May 25. The business terms of the agreement, such as pricing, the fees paid to ICANN, our renewal rights and the 6-year term of the agreement are all unchanged. Regarding .web. On Monday, ICANNs website published a notice of a scheduled Board of Directors meeting to take place this Sunday. One of the Board's agenda items is to further consider the .web IRP final declaration. ICANN then publish the minutes from 2 BAMC meetings, 1 held on January 31 which discussed the BAMC's consideration of certain recommendations related to web. And also the minutes from a meeting on March 2 which state that the BAMC approved recommendations related to .web and requested that those recommendations be sent to the Board. We believe that this new information published this week means progress towards a final resolution is being made but beyond what was posted, we have no updates. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I will return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $364 million, up 5.1% from the same quarter of 2022 and delivered operating income of $241 million, an increase of 7.3% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in Q1 totaled $123 million compared to $122 million a year earlier. Net income for the first quarter totaled $179 million compared to $158 million a year earlier which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for Q1 2023 compared to $1.43 for the same quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2023 was $259 million and free cash flow was $253 million compared with $207 million and $200 million, respectively, for the first quarter of 2022. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.505 billion. This updated revenue range reflects our expectation that the domain name base growth rate will be between 0.5% and 2.25% as Jim mentioned earlier. Operating income is now expected to be between $990 million and $1.05 billion. Interest expense and nonoperating income net which includes interest income estimates is still expected to be an expense of between $35 million to $45 million. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $35 million to $45 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22% and 25%. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter of 2023 and we look forward to continuing to deliver on our mission as well as our objectives throughout the year. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. We strongly believe our strategic focus and disciplined management continue to serve us well, allowing us to deliver another solid quarter in which we provided secure and reliable infrastructure services, manage our business responsibly and efficiently and return value to our shareholders. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and focus. While there is some continuing turbulence in the economy due to macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, we see signs of stability and modest growth in our business. We're also pleased that there is progress on the resolution of .web. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Jim, a lot on the call here. So I guess just to kind of level set at the outset, maybe you can give us a sense of kind of what you thought were kind of the biggest takeaways here for you guys? And then I had a few other questions. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks, Rob. I know this may sound simple like I'm trivializing but what we do is anything but trivial. By the way, a wise man from Omaha said that just because something is simple doesn't mean it's easy to do and to do it consistently and over a sustained period of time is even more difficult. So I mentioned in my remarks that what we accomplished in the quarter as we reliably and securely operated our infrastructure. We added another 3 months to a 25-year uptime record. That's really significant. We responsibly and efficiently run our business. That's always important. That's how we take care of our people. That's how we control expenses. That's how we focus on things that we can control. And number three, we return value to our shareholders. We certainly have obligations there. So this is what our customers want. They want reliable and secure operation of our infrastructure, of course, they want it to work. It needs to work. This is what our governing bodies, ICANN and the U.S. government want the contracts and the SLAs and the performance requirements make that clear. And we believe that this is what our shareholders want. So I guess that's what I mean when I say that this was a solid quarter for us. That's what we -- that's consistently what we strive for every quarter. And I would say that -- so those are the takeaways. I would just add that the fundamental drivers of our business are Internet adoption and reliance and that fundamental long-term trend line is strong. So another solid quarter. Rob Oliver : Okay. There's been so much -- and .web has been so long since we've had news. So I guess just trying to read into here what you told us about this meeting this coming Sunday. It sounds to me like that could be an indication that there's some decision would be rendered imminently here. Just curious to know if that's the way you think about it. Jim Bidzos : Well, you're right, Rob. It has been a long time and we have always declined to speculate on ICANNs process. It is ICANNS process. So I won't speculate as to what the more may do. We're certainly pleased that there's been progress. This information about the meetings is good to see. I can add one thing which is that when the ICANN Board, when it does pass resolutions and board meetings, ICANN typically publishes them on their website within 2 days. So if there are resolutions that come out of the Sunday meeting, they should be public by Tuesday. Rob Oliver : Okay, really helpful. If I could squeeze in 1 one. I appreciate it. I know I'm not the only one anymore, so I want to be conscious of that which is great. Just around the macro -- I mean, you guys did tweak down the high end of the range a little bit. At the same time, Jim, you talked a little bit about the stability and kind of steady improvements, my language, not yours necessarily in the business. Can you talk about -- I think we've seen 13 the last 14 weeks or something with sequential improvement in domains. Can you talk about what you're seeing in the macro and specifically around how China reopening impacted you guys? And anything else relative to geographies that you would call out here? Jim Bidzos : Well, I don't know that I can point to any specifics that would give any indication. I can tell you that our general view is, first of all, the worst of COVID is certainly mostly behind us. And the long-term effects, the recovery, there's certainly still some turbulence associated with that recovery supply chain issues, etcetera. There's certainly some economic turbulence interest rates were up. They're down a little. They're up again. Employment data is good, not so good. It's good. So that's the kind of turbulence we're referring to. That long term -- that long trend line is a strong one that we watch. But we are seeing what I would call some stability in our business. The fundamental value of the services that we provide, the utility of domain names is unchanged. And so I think we're just sort of going through that turbulence and it's affecting us. But we have seen an improvement and we're happy with the quarter. Operator : We'll take our last question from Ygal Arounian with Citi. Ygal Arounian : Appreciate Rob saving some questions from me. Maybe I'll just start on just a follow-up on the macro and the domains. You guys gave the full year guide and you're raising the low end, you're lowering the high end. Can you just talk about how you -- how 1Q came in versus where your expectations were? Are trends stronger to start the year than you thought? And what are -- what needs to happen to get to the high end of the range versus the low end of the range in terms of demand registrations as we work our way through the year? George Kilguss : Ygal, it's George. Sorry, a little echo there. But in any event, as Jim mentioned, we had modest gains here in Q1 with the domain name base growing about 1 million names here in the first quarter. When we look around our various regions. We did see the domain name base grow and pretty much all of our major regions with the exception of our China registrars, that segment was lower year-over-year. And when we look at our new units, we also saw some modest gains in new registrations, as Jim mentioned, year-over-year. The U.S. was a little bit tepid or flat here in Q1 relative to the prior year ago quarter. We did see some improvements in EMEA and the rest of the world, again, excluding China. China's new registrations were also lower year-over-year. And so as Rob alluded to, as you're acquiring, as far as China and the reopening, I would just say it's a little early days for us. We haven't yet seen any meaningful impact there but we are keeping an eye out for it. And I think to the extent that, that reopening happens sooner than later. That clearly can help us get to the higher end of our domain name base range. Ygal Arounian : So I was just going to follow up on the renewal rates which had a nice bump from 4Q and really the past couple of quarters so 1Q is there. Is that more typical seasonality in 1Q? Or are you seeing that kind of trend line improve from here in the past few quarters? George Kilguss : Yes. So as you point out, renewal rates were relatively stable year-over-year, 75.6% versus the 75.9% in the first quarter. We did see an improvement from Q4. I'd said -- I say when you look at renewal rates in a big picture, our domestic renewal rates are relatively stable and where we see fluctuations is more in the international markets. And when we look a little deeper there, it's more in the first time renewal rates there with international markets. And so we've seen the improvement here sequentially year-over-year. And I think renewal rates are pretty stable right now where we see them. Ygal Arounian : Got it. A, on the .web, I just want to see if you guys can expand on so I can't post this agreement for public comments until May 25, all the factors of the contracts are the same, nothing's really changing. What is the process from here to renewal? What is the public comment piece? What are things that might change or stand in the way? Or do you kind of expect it to just kind of work through pretty seamlessly? Jim Bidzos : Well, typically, in this process, comments will be collected and ICANN will address the comments in response. So I think until we see that, I can't really totally answer your question. But the process of engaging with ICANN and coming up with a contract that was proposed negotiated and the proposed and put out for comment with its consistent features, as you point out. That part is done. And of course, the comment as you mentioned. So until it's done and the comments are assessed and reported on by ICANN, then the next step concludes. Ygal Arounian : Okay. And then I'll ask one more and then ask someone so I'll let him -- I'll take some for him, too. So on the .web, hopefully one step closer here, can you help us understand what happens, let's say, let's just assume that it goes through and it's all said and done. What are the steps from there? What happens? How long does it take for -- to become meaningful or for .web registration to start opening up? Maybe just help us -- help them just think about the time line for what happens if we just assume that this part of the process finishes. Jim Bidzos : Sure. I can give you some information that I think will be helpful to your question. One is that there are -- first of all, there is nothing in our 2023 guidance that we provided that includes any revenue or expense for .web. And I think I don't want to speculate about what's going to happen at the Board meeting Sunday and I certainly don't want to speculate beyond that. But there are processes that are required to be followed. There are a number of things that have to be done. There are a number of security periods where certain things have to be done and then there are some other trademark holder protection periods where they're exclusively allowed to come in and acquire their protected domain name. So there's certainly a number of cycles that are all roughly collectively, it's some number of months. But I think at this point, whenever anything happens, if it does, that there will be no change in what I just said about the revenue or expense in 2023. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to VeriSign's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and 2 non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. We delivered another successful quarter by focusing on our mission as a critical infrastructure operator. The quarter included the renewal of the .net registry agreement and solid financial results. Additionally, last week, we marked 26 years of 100% availability in the .com, .net domain name resolution system. Throughout the various global challenges over the past 26 years, from the pandemic to natural disasters to evolving cyber threats, our purpose-built network has kept billions of people worldwide continuously connected to what matters most. The work we do to operate, protect and evolve key Internet infrastructure has never been more important than it is today. Reaching this mark is a testament to the ongoing investments made in our platforms, processes and people. On June 30, we announced the renewal of the .net registry agreement with ICANN, as expected, given the presumptive right of renewal in our agreement. The business terms of the agreement such as pricing, the fees paid to ICANN, our renewal rights and the 6-year term of the agreement are unchanged. The next renewal for the .net registry agreement will be June of 2029. In addition to delivering on our mission during the second quarter, I'm pleased with the financial results which showed the continued strength of our business during this uncertain macroeconomic period. For the second quarter, revenues grew 5.7% year-over-year while EPS grew 16.2% year-over-year. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 174.4 million domain names, up from 174.3 million in Q2 2022 and up from 173.8 million names at the end of 2022. During the second quarter, the domain name base decreased by 0.3 million domain names, offsetting some of the 1 million names we added during the first quarter. From a new registration perspective, the second quarter delivered a 1.5% year-over-year increase with 10.2 million new registrations compared to 10.1 million last year. We believe that the renewal rate for the second quarter of 2023 will be approximately 73.4% compared to 73.8% a year ago. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, the core value proposition for domain names remain strong and we're seeing broad-based engagement from our registrar channel. However, with these fundamentals intact, low demand from China remains the primary source of drag on the overall domain name base growth. With this current trend, we now expect a domain name base growth rate of between 0% and 1% for the full year of 2023. This updated range reflects continued uncertainty, especially the weakness we continue to see related to China. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $936 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $220 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for share repurchase of VeriSign common stock by $1.14 billion to a total of $1.5 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program which has no expiration. On .web, as many of you have seen from our statement on May 3, ICANN's Board of Directors dismissed Afilias' objections regarding the .web auction and directed that NDC's .web application move forward. This was a significant finding by the Board and we're pleased that our role in the auction was proved to be consistent with ICANN's policies. Subsequently, according to ICANN's website, Afilias has filed another IRP complaint, presumably challenging the Board's decision. This filing has not been posted nor has any response from ICANN. ICANN has placed NDC's .web application on hold now. Given the Board's decision, we see no basis for any further delay in delegating .web but this is an ICANN process and we're not yet involved in it. Finally, as announced in today\u2019s earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.99 for the annual wholesale price for .net domain names which will raise the price from $9.92 to $10.91 effective February 1, 2024. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. I'll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George? George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the company generated revenue of $372 million, up 5.7% from the same quarter of 2022 and delivered operating income of $249 million, an increase of 5.4% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in the second quarter totaled $123 million compared to $123 million last quarter and $116 million a year earlier. Net income totaled $186 million compared to $167 million a year earlier which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.79 for the second quarter of 2023 compared to $1.54 for the same quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2023 was $145 million and free cash flow was $139 million, both of which were at similar levels in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the 6-month period ended June 30 totaled $404 million and $392 million and were up from $352 million and $339 million, respectively, for the same 6-month period a year ago. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.500 billion. This updated revenue range reflects our expectation that the domain name base growth rate will be between 0% and 1%, as Jim mentioned. Operating income is still expected to be between $990 million and $1.05 billion. Interest expense and nonoperating income net which includes interest income estimates is now expected to be an expense of between $30 million to $40 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $45 million to $55 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 22% and 25%. In summary, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter of 2023 and we look forward to continuing to deliver on our mission and our objectives throughout the year. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. We strongly believe our strategic focus and disciplined management continue to serve us well, allowing us to deliver another solid quarter in which we provided secure and reliable infrastructure services, managed our business responsibly and efficiently and return value to our shareholders. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and focus. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Jim, my first question is for you. I've got 3 questions total. But first is for you and it's on .com. I think we all can kind of see real-time some of the sluggishness in the market. And it looks like really domain activity in .com has not kind of come back to sort of prepandemic levels maybe as you guys had hoped. I know in your prepared remarks and appreciate the commentary relative to China but would just love to hear a little bit more about your view there on what's happening, whether it be China or if there are other factors? And I know Janet Yellen was just over in China, called for stimulus, sounds like there's some coming. So I just would also love to hear what you think gets us out of this rut. Jim Bidzos : I wish I knew the answer to that but let me do my best. I'm happy to share what I can. Well, first, there's the obvious macro factors affecting the economy and extended COVID recovery declining but still high inflation rates, geopolitics and the growth rate of new business starts which while still improving, are still off their highs. As far as specific factors for our business, I don't know how to put it, Rob, there's China. It's the largest single factor and it continues to remain soft in both new registrations and renewal rates. Stringent registration rules and a challenging COVID recovery seem to be the main factors there. In the U.S., channel focus is a factor. As we've seen before, some channel partners shift their focus to ARPU rather than new customer acquisition in times of slower economic activity. That is cyclical. At some point, they -- you got to acquire new customers. And so they'll return to that. Our revised guidance recognizes the uncertainty that all these factors represent for the remainder of 2023. I'll just add and as far as things we can control, these include meeting our contractual requirements, obviously but practicing responsible expense management and focusing on our capital allocation strategy. Continuing to focus on those areas that we can control, that's the key for us to deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders. So hopes that's helpful. Rob Oliver : Very helpful, yes. And I also appreciate that you went into some detail in your prepared remarks on .web. And I think just stepping back now; it's been a 6-, almost 7-year journey now. And I think investors are confused by the landscape and what's going on. And it's very hard to know whether this sort of resets us back to the beginning of the process with the IRP or whether this is now a next step in the process which would circumvent the need to do that. If you could help us perhaps provide a little bit more color as to how you view that currently to the extent that you can. Jim Bidzos : Happy to do that. I keep a couple of notes here handy, just for that purpose. Let me -- well, first of all, it's easy to get confused. I completely understand that. There's a lot of -- we talk about this every quarter and there are a lot of terms that we use, acronyms like IRP and CEP that even experienced lawyers wouldn't be familiar with if they didn't operate in the ICANN world. So maybe I can simplify with a little bit of background what's happened. Maybe even define some of these terms. So first, when we talk about an IRP, independent review panel, that's a lawsuit, not in court but more like an arbitration demand that someone can bring against ICANN. However, the only claims allowed are those based on a violation by ICANN of its bylaws. A CEP, you've heard us use that, or cooperative engagement process, is a discussion between a potential IRP filer and ICANN ahead of an IRP. And all actions associated with the issue behind the IRP are automatically put on hold during the CEP and that's kind of what we've been in for the last few weeks. You've also heard another acronym, NDC, that's -- that stands for Nu Dot Co and that's a company that VeriSign entered into an agreement with about .web. So let me try to simplify just how we got here. I don't want to speculate about what's going to happen going forward, not just because it's pending litigation but much of it is ICANN process that's not ours. But let me just give you a really brief history now that some of the terms are easier to understand with .web. So in 2016, there was an auction for .web. NDC won that auction with our backing. In 2018, a company called Afilias, the plaintiff, filed an IRP seeking to have the IRP panel disqualify NDC and to award .web to them because Afilias objected to the auction and to our, VeriSign's, participation with NDC. A few years later in 2021 after a lengthy legally maneuverings, the IRP panel said, no. The panel said, ICANN owns the issue and the panel tells ICANN to go review and decide the issue. But Afilias doesn't like that answer and files a follow-up motion asking the panel essentially for a do-over. And the panel once again tells Afilias, no. But this time, they call Afilias' request frivolous and they sanction Afilias, ordering Afilias to pay ICANN's attorney fees. During 2022 and early '23, ICANN then follow the panel's recommendation. They undertook a thorough 16-month review process. In early May of this year, ICANN announced that it had completed its review and had concluded, by a Board vote that was without objection, that Afilias' accusations were wrong and that the Board -- and then the Board directed ICANN's staff to proceed with processing NDC's .web application. Afilias then filed the CEP which then automatically paused the processing of .web. So now Afilias has filed another IRP, that's true. But this time, there's something new and substantial. There's the definitive and affirmative ruling from the ICANN Board of Directors, again, without objection, a vote that .web should be awarded to NDC, a vote resulting from a 16-month process that included work by ICANN's staff who reviewed new submissions by VeriSign and Afilias, working with their law firms, who were allowed to use and even supplement the entire legal record from the earlier 2-year IRP, a vote that resulted in a finding that .web should be awarded to NDC. So that's new and that's not trivial. We believe that Afilias has been and is still litigating for delay. Now in terms of next steps, we'll have to see whether ICANN continues with the hold on .web, the .web delegation or not during the IRP. ICANN could continue processing the .web PLD during the IRP, although that decision could be challenged. We don't believe there should be any further delay but this is ICANN's process and we will continue to work within that system. So what happens next? I don't want to comment on, as I said, it's pending litigation but I hope that bit of background and history was helpful. Rob Oliver : Yes, it's really helpful. I appreciate that summary, Jim and I'm glad it's on the transcript because I know for one, I'm going to need to look back at that, although I've looked at a lot of it. Jim Bidzos : Yes, there's a lot there but -- yes. Rob Oliver : Yes, really. You even have me will through a lot of it. I really appreciate it. I know -- and I'm not the only one anymore, so I'll squeeze in one last question and that is just on .net. I just wanted to ask, so it's second year in a row where you guys are availing yourself of the opportunity to raise price on .net. And that's coming off for a long period where you did not. What's changed for you guys relative to your view to take price now on .net? What, if anything, in terms of your mindset, mentality has changed there and -- relative to .net pricing? George Kilguss : Yes. Thanks, Rob. This is George. I mean if you look back at .net, I mean, we had not taken a price increase for quite a period of time. I think the last price increase we took was in 2018. And obviously, we announced and just took one here in February to $9.92. So as we think about .net, we'll look at the industry, we'll look at where it's positioned within the marketplace and we think the price that we're raising it to that we just announced is keeping .net competitive with the other TLDs within the -- which it competes with. Operator : We will take our last question from the line of Ygal Arounian with Citigroup. Ygal Arounian : I want to come back to the overall growth in domains. Two parts on that. First, I wanted dig to into the comment about China being the kind of biggest piece of this and China is a much smaller part of your overall revenue base. So I just want to understand like how it's driving that impact. So are you saying that domain growth in the U.S. is relatively healthy? Is there any color you can give to what the growth in the U.S. and other regions might be? So what ex-China looks like? And then, the comment on the channel focus and the channel focusing on ARPU versus net adds, that was really interesting. Can you help -- can you just elaborate on that point a little bit? Like how responsible are the channel partners for driving the growth? Is it their marketing and the push for domain registration? Like what is their role and how much of an impact can they have in spurring up demand? George Kilguss : Yes. Sure, Ygal. This is George. So your first question was from kind of a domain name base perspective. We have seen growth here in Q2. I would say the regions that we report out on the U.S., EMEA and our all other segments from a year-over-year domain name base have all been growing. But China, we've seen that domain name base segment decline. I think if you want to get some relative terms, you probably can look in our 10-Q that's filed this afternoon and look at the revenue growth rates of those segments. You'll see that China in the quarter was down about 10%, EMEA was up about 1% and the U.S. was up about 7% and all of the category was up about 15% and that really comprised -- the weighted average of that comprised 5.7%. So we're still seeing growth. As far as new units, I would say China, again, is down. The U.S. was relatively flat here in the second quarter from a new unit perspective. But the other markets that we report on were up. So still seeing some growth here in the market but China has really been, as Jim mentioned, a drag on new unit growth here and a little bit on revenue growth as well. Jim Bidzos : Yes, Ygal, Jim. Your question about ARPU, let me just say one thing upfront, you can clarify the question after this, if you want but I just want to say that we -- I think you know but we have sort of limited visibility into the end user, obviously, sell only through registrars. So I think the point is, is that ARPU is a sort of phenomenon. It's typical of any business. In certain economic conditions, it becomes more efficient for them to focus on ARPU rather than customer acquisition as the cost of those activities vary and the results are different and more advantageous in certain economic conditions. So the observation is based on a phenomenon that affects our channel just like everybody else, not on anything that's particularly unique that we see or understand about it. And we can just observe this behavior, obviously, through our own registrations and monitoring their websites and looking at how they bundle their products. But this is something that every business does, not unique to registries, registrars or the DNS, just to clarify. So there's a limit to what -- I mean there's not a great insight there that -- it's just an observation, a factual observation based on what we see and observe. And it tends to be cyclical. We see that, obviously, they go through cycles, you focus on ARPU for a while and then you go back into new customer acquisition. So we see that -- I think it was in 2014, we had a very visible cycle of this that we went through. Ygal Arounian : Okay. I'm asking because I think it was really interesting comment and just kind of tie from what we've seen from those channel partners like some of the key levers you've talked about, marketing efficiencies and to pull back materially on the marketing spend. And then we also saw some consolidation within the space on the [indiscernible]. So I'm not sure if what you think about that, if that has an impact to it, likely tying it to the marketing expenses. Jim Bidzos : I had some difficulty hearing the last part of that. Marketing spend certainly is another factor in various economic circumstances. Obviously, any retailers are going to vary their marketing spend and that has an effect on us. And obviously, during the pandemic and recently, we've seen some of that behavior that affected registrations as well. If I missed anything in the last part of your question, I apologize, please ask again. The line is a bit fuzzy. Ygal Arounian : No, that's it. I think you've got the question. It's really helpful and really interesting. I mean I haven't thought about it that way, so interesting to hear. Jim Bidzos : Okay, great. I was glad it was helpful. David Atchley : Great. Thanks, Ygal. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.

Recording of this conference is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator.

Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. We delivered another solid quarter by focusing on our mission as a critical Internet infrastructure operator. In addition to delivering on our mission during the third quarter, I'm pleased with the financial results, which show the continued strength of our business model during this uncertain macroeconomic period. For the third quarter, revenues grew 5.4% year-over-year, while EPS grew 15.8% year-over-year. At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 173.9 million domain names, up slightly from 173.8 million names at the end of 2022. During the third quarter, the domain name base decreased by 0.5 million domain names. From a new registration perspective, the third quarter ended with 9.9 million new registrations, flat with the same quarter last year. We believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2023 will be approximately 73.4% compared to 73.7% a year ago. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, the core value proposition for domain names remain strong, and we're seeing broad-based engagement from our registrar channel. However, even with those fundamentals intact, low demand from China remains the primary source of drag on the overall domain name base growth, excluding registrars based in China, both our domain name base and new registrations are up year-over-year through Q3. With this current trend, we now expect the change in the domain name base for full year 2023 to be between negative 0.4% and positive 0.4%. This updated range reflects continued uncertainty primarily due to the weakness we're seeing from China. Our financial and liquidity position remained stable with $943 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $220 million. At quarter end, $1.34 billion remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. Regarding web, Today, I can posted Altanovo's IRP complaint and ICANNs answer to its website. I urge anyone interested in this issue to read it as I believe it will help you understand our current and past statements on .web. We think ICANN's answer is informative, and I'd like to read the concluding paragraph from ICANN's document. First, I just want to clarify that the reference to NDC here is a company new .co, which is Verisign's partner in the .web application. The conclusion reads as follows : \"after an exhaustive first .web IRP and an extremely thorough evaluation process following that IRP, I can determine that NDC did not violate the guidebook or the auction rules. I can fully comply with its articles, bylaws and internal policies and procedures when it made that determination, and the Board's resolution is entitled to difference under the bylaws' enshrinement of the business judgment rule. Accordingly, Altanovo's IRP request should be denied. We agree with ICANN. We continue to believe that this IRP followed by Altanovo and its backers has been filed for the purpose of delay. I will also repeat our intention, which is to bring .web to market by this company that has operated .com and .net with reliability and confidence for nearly 30 years. With its newly available namespace, .web will add more choice of registrations for our global channel of thousands of registrars and there are millions of potential customers in a new generic top level domain. Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I will return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George? George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 30, 2023, the Company generated revenue of $376 million, up 5.4% from the same quarter of 2022 and delivered operating income of $254 million, an increase of 7.4% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in the third quarter totaled $122 million compared to $123 million last quarter and $120 million a year earlier. Net income totaled $188 million compared to $169 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.83 for the third quarter of 2023 compared to $1.58 for the same quarter of 2022. Operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was $245 million, and free cash flow was $217 million compared with the $262 million and $255 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, totaled $650 million and $609 million, respectively, and were up from $614 million and $595 million for the same nine-month period a year ago. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2023 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.490 billion to $1.495 billion. Operating income is now expected to be between $995 million and $1 billion. Interest expense and nonoperating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is now expected to be an expense of between $25 million to $35 million. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $45 million to $55 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is now expected to be between 21% and 24%. In summary, Verisign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2023 and we look forward to continuing to deliver on our mission and our objectives to finish the year. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. We strongly believe our strategic focus and disciplined management continue to serve us well, allowing us to deliver another solid quarter in which we provided secure and reliable infrastructure services, managed our business responsibly and efficiently and return value to our shareholders. While there is ongoing turbulence in the economy due to macroeconomic and geopolitical issues and there continues to be low demand from China, the fundamentals of our business remain strong. These strong business fundamentals and our focus on managing items within our control continues to deliver strong financial results, including steady growth in revenue, operating income and EPS. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks, and now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird. Rob Oliver : Jim, I'd like to start certainly noted the comments relative to China and that the rest of the business would have been up on the demand front had it not been for China. So loud and clear on that. Just curious to hear your take on the China market right now, maybe what you're hearing from your partners on the ground there as to when things might stabilize or if there's anything else going on in that market that we should be aware of. And then I had a follow-up. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks, Rob. So with respect to China, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, for the past several quarters, our domain name demand from China-based registrars has been weak as a result of several factors. They include challenging economic conditions, a more stringent regulatory environment and the impact of a weaker local currency combined with retail pricing adjustments. We believe these factors combined have driven down demand in China, which has been offset by domain and gains in other geographies. As you can see in the geographic revenue table filed in our 10-Q this afternoon, we generated $22 million or about 6% of revenue in the quarter from China-based registrars and that revenue was down about $5 million from the year ago quarter. The remaining $354 million of revenue in the quarter from registrars outside of China was up $24 million or about 7%. So we're able to drive both top line and operating income growth even as our China registrars adjust to their specific set of factors. To your specific question of when we think things will normalize for our China-based registrars, I would say two things. One, the only certainty is changed and the future developments that influence that change are not within our control. So your guess would be as good as ours. And two, I think the term perfect storm is overused, but it feels a bit like that here. I feel that the chances that change will be helpful is at least as likely as not . Rob Oliver : Okay. Great. Jim, for that very helpful color. My follow-up was around the ICANN post on .web. And I guess, pretty clear their view, but just -- and forgive me if I should know this, but there's been so -- it's been a labor journey here on .web. And so now that, that opinion from iCANN has hit. What -- where does that leave us? And what should we expect next? Or what do you think will happen next? Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks for that question. let's say a couple of things. First of all, I mentioned that in the document, I urge everybody to read the document, I think it's really indicative of obviously what ICANNs response will be. I clarified the term NBC to be new .co, which is a company that we actually partnered with in something called the DAA, the domain acquisition agreement, and you'll see those terms used throughout. And -- so the -- what to expect next? I think the important thing here is that this is a legal proceeding that we are currently not a party to that might change. So I think what you're going to see next is they're working to form a panel and then the documents that are going to be filed became public today, and that is the IRP complaint from Altanovo and ICANN's answer. So we'll be watching those developments. We don't know anything beyond that. We urge you to read what's out there now, and I think that gives you some expectation of what the issues on the table would be when the proceedings begin. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Ygal Arounian with Citi. Ygal Arounian : I want to dig into the pace of domain growth a little bit, and understood the pressures in China. So maybe just a few things around outside of China. You disclosed the revenue growth by geography. And maybe you could just speak a little bit to the domain growth by geography to and if you're seeing different brands. There's some pricing within the geography revenue growth as well. So -- what are you seeing overall by geography and domains? And even though it's better than what we're seeing in China, we're still kind of below historical norms, and what you think the contributing factors are there around that? George Kilguss : Just a couple of points. I mean there's obviously a lot going on in the world today. Obviously, we have some macroeconomic factors, still high interest rates, so there's still high inflation. Obviously, there's some geopolitical factors going on there. So I think those are -- like other companies, those things are impacting our business. But as Jim mentioned, we are seeing ex-China's registrars growth from those groups, both in new registrations as well as the domain name base there. Again, I would point to, we really don't break out the domain name base for competitive purposes. But I would point you to our geographic revenue disclosure, which really gives you a sense of some of the growth. We don't -- we charge the same price. We do charge the same price across all markets. So we offer that to everybody. So I think it's a fair comparison for you to take a look at that. But the domain name base continues to be resilient. I think the value proposition of the domain name remains strong. But the declines we're seeing in China, which is a smaller geographical segment, of ours is impacting the total domain name base growth, but we're able to offset that as the other geographies have performed better. Ygal Arounian : Got it. Okay. That's helpful there. And maybe on the cost side. Also, you guys continue to come in ahead of expectations despite the relative softness on the revenue side. So as we kind of get to the end of this year and start looking into 2024, just maybe walk us through how you're thinking about cost and investments and what's needed, what's not and how you're approaching that? George Kilguss : Yes. We'll provide full year guidance on our next earnings call for 2024. Our expenses or the midpoint of our guidance suggests that our expenses will be lower this year, around 3%, and that's down from prior years. Keep in mind, we did have some costs come out of the business with regard to .tv migrated away from us. That was about $5 million of fees that we paid to .tv that is not picked up this year. But if you were to normalize that out, we're probably at a similar expense growth rate this year than last year. And as you recall, last year, expenses grew about 4% or so. So we'll continue to manage expenses and be responsible. As Jim said, several quarters in a row. During this time of uncertainty, we're trying to control what we can control and that means being responsible, making sure we're making the right investments and areas where we can make some efficiencies, we'll do so. But I can assure you, we're making all the necessary investments we need to execute our mission and our strategic framework to protect the Company and meet our SLAs. Jim Bidzos : Yes. Ygal, this is Jim. George is exactly right. The term responsible expense control for us means that, first and foremost, investment in our infrastructure to provide the critical infrastructure services that we do provide is simply mandatory. We make all of those, but we manage responsibly where we can. And as George said, next round of earnings will give you full 2024 guidance. Operator : And we will go back to Rob Oliver with Robert W. Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Just squeezing in here with one more. Jim, my question is for you. You mentioned, I think, in response to my earlier question just around the macro, which you characterized some ongoing turbulence and clearly, China is a part of that. But outside of China, that I know you guys are growing outside of that generally. But just be curious to hear your take on the current macro and whether your characterization earlier was anything incremental or if it was sort of the same now as when you entered the quarter, certainly, in terms of Middle East and headlines out there feels sentiment. I think it feels like things are a bit softer, but just wanted to get a sense on what you're seeing and hearing from your partners. Jim Bidzos : Yes. That is all of the events around the world, whether it's Ukraine or the Middle East, all of those, we believe, are impacting the economy and indirectly are part of the geopolitical issues that affect some of the macroeconomic trends and headwinds that we're seeing. And I think those are broad and you're seeing that effect for companies -- tech companies, I think, across the board. That one is tough to assess how it's going to impact us in the future. It's relatively the events, they are relatively recent. So I don't know that we have any real insight into anything we can identify at this point. I can tell you, at least from what I'm seeing publicly, I think there are certainly challenges in the Chinese market, and that's obviously the biggest impact, and that seems to be felt broadly across the tech space as well. But we monitor these things we observe them. Nothing to report right now. I appreciate your question. I just don't have any trend data or transcends even really to share at this point. Certainly, they do have some negative impact. People are more cautious, interest rates rise, all sorts of second and third order effects occur from these. And that's what we were alluding to when we talk about them. They do sort of put some pressure on the business. Interest rates, in particular -- no particular order all of the things we mentioned. And as George said, what we do then as a result is we focus on what we can control. We make absolutely certain that we're delivering our services in accordance with our contracts. That's first and foremost. And secondly, we engage frequently constantly in responsible expense control. Those are the things we can do, and our business model allows us to deliver solid quarters while we wait for better economic climate. Operator : That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to Verisign's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman and CEO; Todd Strubbe, President and COO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About Verisign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-Q. Verisign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by Verisign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2023 marked another solid year of execution delivering consistent financial results while enhancing our critical internet infrastructure and extending our record of .com and .net DNS availability beyond 26 years. During 2023, revenue grew 4.8% year-over-year while operating income increased by 6.1%.  Shares outstanding at the end of 2023 decreased by 3.7% from the total of outstanding shares at the end of 2022. Our financial and liquidity positions remains stable with $926 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the year. Over the course of the year, we returned $883 million of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 4.2 million shares.  At year end, $1.12 billion remained available authorized under the current share repurchase program which has no expiration. At the end of December, the domain base in .com and .net totaled 172.9 million domain names, down 0.6% from 173.8 million names at the end of 2022. During the fourth quarter, the domain name base decreased by 1.2 million domain names. From a new registration perspective, the fourth quarter ended with 9 million new registrations, compared with 9.7 million names for the same quarter last year. For the full year, new registrations were 39.4 million names, down 490,000 names from the 39.9 million names we saw during 2022. The renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 is expected to be approximately 73.1% compared with 73.3% a year ago.  For the full year 2023, a preliminary renewal rate of 73.9% is below the 74.2% renewal rate of 2022. Both first time and previously renewed names were lower year-over-year. While there are many factors that drive demand for domain names, declining demand from China remains the primary source of drag on the overall domain name base growth.  Our domains under management from China-based registrars declined by 2.2 million names in 2023. China-based registrar demand has been weak as a result of several factors including challenging economic conditions, a more stringent regulatory environment and the impact of a weaker local currency combined with retail pricing adjustments.  Excluding registrars based in China, our domain name base grew by 1.2 million names or 0.8% during 2023. While the domain name base thus far in 2024 has grown quarter-to-date, we have not yet seen any material changes in the current macroeconomic or regulatory landscape in China. Therefore we believe it\u2019s prudent to expect China to continue to negatively impact revenue and domain base growth during 2024.  However, with the China base portion of our base now at about 5% of our overall domain name base, we see the negative trend in China having a less pronounced effect on our overall business after 2024. For 2024, we are expecting the domain name base to remain flat year-over-year with a range of negative 1% and positive 1%.  As announced in today\u2019s earnings release, we have given notice of a price increase of $0.67 to the annual wholesale price for .com domain names with raises of our wholesale price from $9.59 to $10.26 effective September 1, 2024. Even after this increase, we believe com will remain highly competitive with other TLD choices. As a reminder, any of our domains maybe registered for terms up to ten years at the current wholesale price.  Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to George. I\u2019ll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $1.493 billion, up 4.8% and delivered operating income of $1 billion, up 6.1% from 2022. Operating expense totaled $492 million in 2023 and was up 2.2% from the previous year. The full year 2023 operating margin was 67% and free cash flow was $808 million. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the company generated revenue of $380 million, up 3% from the same quarter of 2022, and delivered operating income of $256 million, an increase of 4.4% from the same quarter a year ago.  Operating expense in Q4 totaled $124 million, compared to $122 million last quarter and it was flat from a year earlier.  Net income in the fourth quarter totaled $265 million, compared to $179 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.860 for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $1.70 for the same quarter of 2022. As stated in today\u2019s earnings release, net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 included the recognition of income tax benefits related to the items noted in our release. Cumulatively, these income tax benefits increased net income by $69.3 million, and increased diluted earnings per share by $0.68.  Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $204 million, and free cash flow was $199 million, compared with $217 million and $209 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the full year 2023 totaled $854 million and $808 million, respectively.  I\u2019ll now discuss our full year 2024 guidance. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.560 million to $1.580 million. Operating income is expected to be between $1.045 million and $1.065 million. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates is expected to be an expense of between $30 million to $40 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $35 million to $45 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 24%. Overall, Verisign has continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the last quarter and throughout 2023 and we look forward to building on our strengths in our mission in the coming year. I'll now turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos Thank you, George. While demand from our registrars in China is expected to continue to remain soft in 2024, the fundamentals of our business remains strong. We firmly believe our responsible and disciplined management of our business and capital continue to service well allowing us to report another solid year, which in our view is one in which we fulfill our stewardship mission of providing secure and reliable infrastructure services, manage our business responsibly and efficiently and returning capital to our shareholders. These goals remain unchanged and support our commitment to deliver strong financial results including steady growth in revenue, operating income and EPS. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we will open the call for your questions. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead. Rob Oliver : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Jim you pointed out China, good conversation, obviously that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s mind and so just will be curious to start just to get a sense from you what if anything has changed in China you alluded to the more stringent regulatory environment, but would love to get a thought from you on that? And then I had a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks. Yeah, definitely China is the main focus of the results that we add. I mentioned in my remarks that we saw a 2.2 million unit decline from China registrars and that we had 1.2 million growth from registrars outside of China. So that the issues for us are definitely concentrated in China. And as I\u2019ve said, today and have for several quarters it\u2019s a variety of factors in China. Those are hard to predict that the challenging economic climate there, very difficult to predict what impact it\u2019s having, how long that will last. The regulatory environment is one in which the process of obtaining domain names is a little bit more challenging, a lot more process, a lot more identification, confirmation authentication of the person registering, et cetera, process basically that makes it a little bit more difficult. And as we\u2019ve mentioned for a couple of quarters now, foreign exchange is an issue as well, that increases cost of goods obviously for registrars selling domain names. So all of those things are contributing. It\u2019s really hard to say. It\u2019s an opaque market to try to understand. It\u2019s very fluid. There is a lot going on there. Some of the things that are going on, migration and other stuff are things or shifts are making it difficult to really assess the impact, is it at the bottom? Is it bouncing along the bottom? When will it change? Those are really hard to see inside of a very opaque market. And so, and an abundance of caution, we just find it prudent to really be careful about guidance concerning China and where it might go. So, those are certainly the influence we are guiding to a flattish DNB, domain name base as a result and it\u2019s just really difficult to predict. But as I mentioned, we are reaching the point here where the China base registrars represent about 5% of our zone. So, I guess, the impact \u2013 if the negative impact continues at whatever rate it should be less pronounced as I mentioned. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Jim. And George, if I may, on that domain base guide of negative 1% to plus 1%, how should we think about the impact of China within that? If you could give us a sense of how we might pull back our debt, in other words, what is trying to coming out of the numbers is China move \u2013 is moving beyond China total the forecast or is it starting to moderate? I know Jim just rightfully this is hard to predict, but I guess, you have made some predictions. So just curious how we can ballpark that? George Kilguss : Yeah, Rob, as Jim mentioned, in 2023, China clearly was a drag down about 2.2 million units and from a revenue perspective, which you will see in our when we file our Q, our revenue from China was down about $14.4 million. As we think about the guidance that we\u2019ve provided, both from a revenue perspective and a domain name base perspective, we are assuming that the impact that we saw here in 2023 is going to have a similar impact in 2024 and as a result of that, that\u2019s factoring into kind of the midpoint of our guidance of revenue and also factoring it to the midpoint of our guidance of the domain name base. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. And then, last one from me and then I\u2019ll pass the baton. Just Jim, wanted to see if there was any update that you guys have heard of that we should be aware of about .web and you had .communication in late August and you got commented on the last call just about where things stood. But just wanted to see if we could get a refresh run matter of anything we should be aware of coming up. Thank you. Jim Bidzos : Yeah, thanks for that question too. So there is not a new update on .web. I\u2019ll just reiterate what I said last time which hasn\u2019t changed which is that I can\u2019t publish their response to the latest IRP and they were very dismissive of it that described in detail. Again their process that they employed in determining the .web was handled properly and that there are no issues. And so, what we\u2019ve seen so far is basically process and procedure delays. And we are confident that that\u2019s going to come to an end that those will run out eventually. I just don\u2019t think that anything is going to change in the meticulous process that I can again concluding with the Board both without objection to instruct that to proceed with processing the .web application. Those were the last official communications of the Board in writing to the community and to staff. So, we are waiting for some of these process things to clear up watching the website. So, nothing new from the last time. I\u2019ll just reiterate our confidence in what the outcome will be and reiterate our strong desire and exciting anticipation of bringing .web to market to our extended channel and to their millions of customers. Rob Oliver : Great. Thanks for that, Jim. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Jim Bidzos : Thank you. Operator : We will take our last question from Ygal Arounian with Citi. Please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Maybe just to start, I am assuming that\u2019s probably not a lot you can comment on the upcoming .com renewal, but if there is any chance to something you could say or something you want to comment on just to get and ask about that first? Jim Bidzos : I\u2019ll just say that .com renewal is based on a presumptive right of renewal. The .net renewal last year was similar and executed smoothly and on to .com. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Great. And that\u2019s what I figured. For the global trends, understanding what\u2019s going on in China, talk about the 1 million growth in domains outside of China. Can you frame that a little bit more? Is that typical? Is it still not at where you would call normal historical levels understanding there is some fluctuations over time? What are the trends you are seeing globally that give you confidence or not and if there is anything in particular that you could point on kind of maybe the US and Europe can be helpful? George Kilguss : Yes. Sure, Ygal, this is George. So, yeah, as you just articulated, we did grow about 1.2 million domain names in our base outside of China when we look at that growth, that primarily came from both EMEA and our all other segments. Both of those were up. The US was a little flat. It was down by about 500,000 units in the domain names base year-over-year. But as a reminder, many of our US registrars are global in their reach. So I wouldn\u2019t necessarily attribute all of that weakness here to US registrants. But we do notice that US registrants have been focused more on ARPU this year and 2023. So we think that can be a factor as well. But we didn\u2019t see good growth in EMEA as well as in our other all other segments. Ygal Arounian : Got it. And then, just I guess following down the lines, want to maybe dig into the margin outlook for next year in costs. Less margin expansion at least to start here on the expectation for next year than what we saw this year. Can you just talk about investments and where you are looking to spend next year? And maybe tie in with that expectations around buybacks for next year as well? George Kilguss : Yeah, I can help you a little bit with that. I mean, first, in 2023, our expenses grew by 2.2%. But I will point out that that was favorably impacted by a $5 million reduction in fees paid to the government of Tuvalu. That went away in 2023 as that contract transitioned at the end of 2022. So on a normalized basis if you would adjust for that, we would have been closer to a 3.3% expense growth rate here in 2023, which is still I think a good job by the teams in managing the expense that they are responsible for. If you look at the midpoint of our guidance, that would imply about a 4.6% expense growth rate, which would be very similar to the growth rate we had back in 2022. So, hopefully that gives you some idea on the expense front. We are always investing with our strategic framework in mind making sure we are obviously protecting unconditionally growing responsibly and obviously managing continuously. And so, we will continue to focus on that framework that has served us well over the past several years. As far as buybacks, we really don\u2019t guide to buybacks for a variety of reasons as we\u2019ve talked about. But I think you can expect us to continue to be responsible in returning excess capital to shareholders as we have done for many, many years here in the past. Ygal Arounian : Okay, great. Thanks. And then, last one maybe bigger picture. GoDaddy had an interesting announcement earlier this week, a partnership with Ethereum Name Service or ENS and some of this stuff still on the crypto cycle little over my head, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on that, particularly because there were some commentary about the DNS and some of the challenges with integration there. I am just thinking about the kind of broader future domains and how block chain can impact, and maybe you have some views there. Jim Bidzos : Good question. Thanks, Ygal. Yeah, well this is really a positive development for the DNS. First of all, I don\u2019t want to speak for either ENS of course or GoDaddy. But what they did is, is make it easier to link a domain name to a block chain address. So it\u2019s a very positive development for the DNS and it reinforces the utility of a domain name and the already strong value proposition of a domain name. We\u2019ve spoken here for years about domain names as a stable global identifier, a unique stable global identifier. That that\u2019s the role it can play and the reason we think the domain name is the right, the best way to obtain such a unique identifiers because of the reliability, the maturity of the underlying infrastructure like the part that we operate, the well governed, well regulated space that determines the registrars and registrees are well regulated and how they behave, how they serve up IP addresses, what they have to do, that\u2019s all part of our contract, that\u2019s part of our requirement to perform 24/7 without fail. So they announced the domain names can be easily linked to ENS identifiers. ENS identifiers are typically linked to wallets holding crypto currencies. They are usually at difficult on intelligible string of characters. And there are other uses of ENS identifiers, but crypto currency wallets are a very common one. So, basically, being able to link your domain name to it is basically using this domain name and capping the DNS base with its global unique and stable identifier, all the benefits in the security that\u2019s associated with it linking the block chain spaces, I think is a smart move and really good. It adds more utility and I think significantly more value to domain names. And the linkage itself benefits from the cryptographic strength of the DNS like DNSSEC, the domain name system security extensions. So the ownership that \u2013 the resolution of a domain name, all benefit from the underlying DNS that cryptographic protection to the strong public key infrastructure base things. You don\u2019t see a lot of this work that we do and I think many of you probably know that my previous company are to say, basically inventing form of public ecryptography and build out infrastructure that was VeriSign 1.0. And so, this underlying secure, reliable infrastructure, along with the well governed space is why people are navigating with the DNS, it\u2019s reliable. You are going to get where you want to go. And the ability to get a domain name registrant and have it activated and have it resolved and also well regulated. So, having basically a unique strong global identifier that you can use for all of the coming serves as an applications as we get more connected, more active is a tremendous benefit. I mean, it\u2019s almost like that magical single password you can use everywhere in a world. We think that be a dream come true for a lot of internet users in a way a global unique stable identifier gives you that. And so, this is actually a new web three type of application realizing that there is a stable and secure base out there that you can link to and to get all the advantages out it and let people use those identifiers they already have. So we think this is really good news. Ygal Arounian : Super. A much more thoughtful answer than I expect to be honest. But very interesting in the future of all that. We appreciate your time guys. Jim Bidzos : Well, Ygal, just to add, I mean, the reason for that is that we don\u2019t publicize a lot of the things that we do but for years, we\u2019ve been working on what we call responsible integration of alternative name spaces with the DNS for the very reason that we believe that at some point the secure, well regulated underlying DNS is going to be a better basis for a global identifier for folks. And that, rather you can\u2019t recreate 35 years of innovation building, weaving all kinds of high value applications into the DNS. This is the part of the plumbing that people don\u2019t see that when we talk about operating and maintaining critical infrastructure that we do. So, I jumped on your question, because it\u2019s a great opportunity to point to something we\u2019ve been quietly working on for a while that\u2019s I think now adding real value. George Kilguss : Sure. And maybe some under appreciation of the innovation in the space. So very helpful. Ygal Arounian : Thank you guys. Jim Bidzos : Great. Thanks. George Kilguss : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Once again, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. Welcome to Verisign's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to Verisign's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About Verisign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release.  At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K.  Verisign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and 2 non-GAAP measures used by Verisign : adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call.  Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. D. Bidzos: Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. In addition to continuing to deliver on our mission as a critical Internet infrastructure provider, we delivered solid and consistent financial results during the first quarter. These results show the continued financial strength of our business model.  For the first quarter, revenues grew 5.5% year-over-year, operating income grew 7.3% year-over-year and earnings per share grew 12.9% year-over-year. At the end of March, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 172.5 million domain names, down 270,000 names from year-end 2023. From a new registration perspective, the first quarter ended with 9.5 million new registrations compared with 10.3 million names for the same quarter last year. The renewal rate for the first quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately 74% compared to 75.5% a year ago.  As we discussed last quarter, we expect our domains under management from our China-based registrars to contract in 2024. In the first quarter, this segment declined by 360,000 names. For the reasons noted in prior quarters, this regional softness has been the primary source of the recent drag on the overall domain name base growth.  We're also seeing some softness from our U.S.-based registrars primarily due to their increased focus on ARPU through higher retail pricing levels, which is impacting new registrations and renewal rates. While we had expected these same factors to gradually subside in 2024, based on our first quarter results and current channel feedback, we now expect these conditions to persist through most of 2024.  That being said, we're in the process of rolling out new registrar marketing programs to support and improve registration trends for the second half of this year to achieve our goal of returning the domain name base to growth in 2025. We're now expecting the change in the domain name base to be between positive 0.25% to a negative 1.75% for the full year 2024. As a modeling note, the decrease in domain name base is expected to be most pronounced during the second quarter of '24 due to a seasonally larger expiring base of domains during the first half of the year.  Our financial and liquidity position continues to remain stable with $925 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for $260 million. At quarter end, $860 million remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to George. I'll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the company generated revenue of $384 million, up 5.5% from the same quarter of 2023 and delivered operating income of $259 million, an increase of 7.3% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in the first quarter totaled $125 million compared to $124 million last quarter and $123 million in the year ago quarter.  Net income in the first quarter totaled $194 million compared to $179 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $1.92 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $1.70 for the same quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was $257 million, and free cash flow was $254 million compared with $259 million and $253 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter.  I'll now discuss our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.570 billion. Our operating income is now expected to be between $1.047 billion and $1.062 billion. Interest expense and nonoperating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is now expected to be an expense of between $25 million to $35 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $30 million to $40 million, and the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 21% and 24%.  Overall, Verisign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. D. Bidzos: Thank you, George. While we expect that the change in the domain name base for 2024 will be below historic levels for the reasons we've discussed, we continue to believe our business fundamentals remain strong.  As I mentioned earlier, we're introducing additional registrar marketing programs to target quality growth in the domain name base. These programs will become active during the second half of 2024. We expect these programs to begin improving registration trends during 2024 and to contribute to a return to growth in 2025.  Our goals to fulfill our stewardship mission of providing secure and reliable infrastructure services, managing our secure and reliable infrastructure services and our business responsibly, and efficiently returning capital to our shareholders remain unchanged and support our commitment to deliver strong financial results, including steady growth in revenue, operating income and EPS. Thank you for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Robert Oliver : Great. Jim, first one is for you. Could you just put a finer point on some of those conditions that you discussed, which are weighing on U.S.-based, domestic-based .com growth within registrars? And as a follow-up to that, I don't know how much detail you can provide, but maybe if you could give us any color around what sorts of programs we can expect which could help drive that return to growth in '25. I know you guys clearly have a long operational history of working well with your registrars and would be curious to know -- get a little sense of what it is that you had in mind. And then I had a couple of follow-ups. D. Bidzos: Sure. Let's see, your first question was on the U.S. market. So basically, as we've discussed, what we see is the recent registrar focus on ARPU has led to some higher retail pricing and a reduction of their promotional offers. And of course, just as a reminder, we don't control the retail pricing, the registrars do. And when you combine that with decreased marketing and advertising outlays from the channel, we think this is a factor leading to less demand for products at present as well as some lower registration volumes and lower renewal rates.  As to the marketing programs, obviously, I can't really go into a lot of detail, but I can say that in addition to the existing programs that we have, we've got some new ones coming to market. We have one currently launched that is focused on .net, and we plan to launch additional programs focused on com in the second half of the year. So basically, what I can generally say about these programs and what's different, I think it helps to just understand that our channel is greatly varied. First of all, through COVID and afterwards, they've all gone through changes as we have, but we also have a channel that's evolved to include people like website builders and wholesale registrars who are selling to others. So our strategy is to broaden the options that's available to this sort of diverse group with diverse business models, geographic footprints, different installed bases.  So by offering a broader selection, our goal is to increase engagement with our TLDs for the registrars and their customers. Clearly, one size doesn't fit all, like it has in the past many years ago that worked better. So these programs are really designed to address that diversity, and they also -- they're also designed with feedback that we've received from the community, and multiple options is clearly desirable. So that's the good generalization I can offer you. Robert Oliver : Great. That's helpful color. And then just as a corollary to that, George, for you. We're still running through the model here and obviously, the margin or profit coming down a little bit. That could be a result of the revenue, but is that -- is there -- are there any additional expenses in that second half associated with this program that would -- to drive -- to restart that jump in .com growth for '25? Any additional expenses captured in that change? George Kilguss : Yes, Rob, thanks for the question. I would say not a necessarily direct expense associated with those programs. We do have expense already budgeted, and that is reflected in the current guidance that we're already putting out there for you. Robert Oliver : Okay. Great. Helpful. Last question for me, and then I'll turn it over to Ygal. On China, Jim, last quarter, you mentioned that the situation was, I think you used the word opaque, and that there was just so many moving parts, and you guys have been a strong partner and provider in China for so many years.  I'm curious how, if at all, that visibility has changed from 3 months ago. Is there a chance we see a bottom here? Has there been any evolution, in your view? And any color around what's happening in China would be helpful. D. Bidzos: Sure. Well, I guess, first of all, I would just remind you that in my prepared remarks, at least I mentioned that we do expect China to continue to be a drag through 2024. So that's the first thing. In terms of better visibility, less opacity. I'm -- not really. There's nothing really substantial that I think I can point to that gives us better insights. I just think that, that is a different market for all the reasons that we typically mention.  The regulatory environment is a little bit different. They are much more adversely affected in terms of cost of goods, not just by price increases but also by the cost of buying dollars to pay for those domains. So they've -- that market is just sort of feeling a lot of different impacts. Specific detailed insights into it, no.  I think our view of China is that, of course, at about 5% of our overall domain name base and moving downward, the negative impacts will, of course, ease as we move forward. That's one factor that will help us through 2024. The other, obviously, is 2 things, really. It's our programs that we're targeting at the registrars to help them focus on new customer acquisition and the fact that we think that their ARPU is sort of cyclical. We've seen that before.  But specifically to China, I -- certainly not in the last 3 months, there's nothing I can point to that says we have a clear and better understanding. I think it's just simply affected as being a market that's more regulated and more sensitive. There are probably other factors that we don't fully understand. We study it closely, but that's the best answer I can give you right now. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Ygal Arounian with Citi. Ygal Arounian : If we could dig into the registrars and the focus on pricing and the impact that's having just a little bit more, is there anything within the pricing that's specific to .com that you're seeing, meaning if we look at kind of total domains beyond .com, the softness isn't necessarily as pronounced? So what are the dynamics? Why is it having a bigger impact on .com versus everything? Are they promoting some of the other TLDs more than they are .com? Just to understand that a little bit better. D. Bidzos: Well, it's -- Ygal, it's Jim. It's certainly true that one thing, I guess maybe I could have added, I didn't, so I'm glad you asked this question, to Rob's last question about China is that, that's where we're seeing other TLDs filling some of the demand there. These are TLDs that are priced extremely low. We're talking about sub-$1, in many cases. So that's certainly a factor.  Again, we don't control the retail pricing. The channel is pricing our products .com, .net, sort of in a broad range. Some are pricing renewals above $20. Others are selling registrations and renewals much closer to the wholesale price. It varies. I think that focus on ARPU is probably a primary -- a factor in the U.S. along with the reduced spend on marketing.  And I guess if I wanted to point to anything that we maybe could have done sooner or recognized a little better would be adapting these marketing programs sooner, but we're getting them into market now. So I think that will address some of the issues.  But I think the place where you're seeing others make a huge dent is definitely in China. There are literally sub-dollar TLDs that are being sold there that are experiencing some growth. That's gone on and off over the years with different TLDs spiking way up and way down. You can see that in our DNIB report. George Kilguss : Ygal, it's George. We don't have the flexibility -- as much flexibility, I would say, in new gTLDs in certain markets. So we treat all our customers the same. And so sometimes when we have differences in exchange rates overseas, that can also be a factor in demand. Ygal Arounian : Got it. So just a follow-up on that, then. With pricing focus with Amendment 35 and the structure of the current contracts, do you think that there's maybe less pricing power in the domain? I mean I would think still not retail $20 a year. It's not the highest consideration purchase. Does that give you any pause or thoughts on how you think about pricing at a wholesale level? I know you don't control the retail level, but how does that flow through on how you think about the wholesale level? D. Bidzos: Well, I think the registrars have to make their own decisions on pricing. I think some of the higher renewal prices are, in my opinion, a testament to the stickiness and the high quality of the com product and that the largest segment we have is people who brand themselves on it, and those enjoy particularly high renewal rates. So I think it's just easy, if you have a product, a subscription product, that has strong stickiness like this, a functional TLD that's supported with a 26-year uptime record and all the other benefits that come with it. I think that's not particularly surprising. I'd attribute it more to the cyclical nature of ARPU. And new customer acquisition. And some of our programs are designed to accommodate the different business models that will get them more focused on new customer acquisition. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Helpful. And last one for me. Maybe -- we get a lot of questions as we get closer to the date on the .com renewal, and I'm assuming there's nothing new per se to say about it, but maybe just help us walk through the time line of the renewal. What are some of the key timing things to think about or what the time line might look like? And understanding, I think you've been through the idea that you have, the presumptive right of renewal here, and how the contract works is you're keeping the details the same, but any risks or other things for investors to think about as we get closer to that renewal date? D. Bidzos: I don't know what you mean by risk. I mean the contract has a presumptive right of renewal, and as long as we're meeting all SLAs, the contract says it shall be renewed. But the contract is not due for actual. The deadline date is the end of November, so it's a ways out. But we are now engaged with ICANN and are in the process of exchanging drafts to the com renewal. So it's early in that process, and com is, like I said, not due until the end of November.  And the presumptive right of renewal, of course, was used with .net, and we had a -- we anticipate an on-time renewal as we had last year for .net. I think these -- ICANN has this in all of their thousands of gTLD contracts. There's a rolling constant exercise of this presumptive right of renewal, and we expect com, just like net and just like all the other gTLDs, to renew. Operator : And we'll take an additional question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Robert Oliver : Great. Jim, last quarter, you got a question on .web, so I think I'll ask it again. I'm not sure that there's been -- I know this doesn't seem like there's been any official update, but anything you guys have heard or seen or anything we should be aware of that constitutes any change? And could you just provide us your updated perspective on what you see as the possible time line or evolution of that web here? D. Bidzos: Thanks, Rob. Good question. I guess I would call it an update. You said movement. I guess this could qualify as that as well. So the one update I have is that Verisign and NDC have just filed an application to participate in this second IRP like we did the first one, as you know.  We had that -- for context, we had this process where last April, ICANN's Board of Directors voted without objection to delegate .web to NDC. Altanovo then filed the second IRP complaint against ICANN. This second IRP is looking for the same relief to award .web to Altanovo that the first IRP panel rejected twice, sanctioning them the second time, and it's exactly what ICANN's Board committee and full Board also rejected last April. So we continue to believe that ICANN and the IRP panel should dispense as quickly as possible with what we believe to be baseless claims against ICANN. And by the way, Altanovo has no existing registry business, and as far as we can tell, whoever actually owns and is funding this litigation remains a secret. So the update is that we filed an application, and we'll see where the second IRP goes. Robert Oliver : Great. That's helpful. I'll have to go back to the record to look at that again. But very helpful. Operator : And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",

Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under -- about VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we cover results, I'd like to note that last week; we marked 27 years of 100% uninterrupted availability for the .com, .net domain name resolution system. This milestone represents an unparalleled achievement in our industry for operating secure, stable and resilient DNS infrastructure. For well over 1/4 of the century, amidst some of the most technologically significant changes the world has ever experienced, our teams have successfully built, maintained, operated and evolved the infrastructure that enables hundreds of billions of queries a day and supports trillions of dollars in global commerce. In fact, we answer on average, 328 billion queries per day, billion with a B. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, and that's over 3.7 million per second. We do this amidst ever-increasing Internet demand and resilience, evolving technology and a challenging global cyber threat environment. Turning now to our results. We delivered another quarter of operational and financial stability by focusing on our mission as a critical Internet infrastructure provider. For the second quarter, revenues grew 4.1% year-over-year, operating income grew 7.1% year-over-year and earnings per share grew 12.3% year-over-year. At the end of June, the domain name basin .com, .net totaled 170.6 million domain names. During the second quarter, the domain name base decreased by 1.8 million names. From a new registration perspective, the second quarter ended with 9.2 million new registrations compared with 10.2 million names for the same quarter last year. The renewal rate for the second quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately 72.6% compared to 73.4% a year ago. As we have previously reported, we continue to see U.S. registrars prioritize ARPU over customer acquisition through higher retail pricing levels and reduced spend on marketing to customers compared with prior years. These factors impacting new registrations are impacting new registrations and renewal rates and are leading to weaker trends in 2024 that are below our original expectations. During the second quarter, the U.S. region was lowered by about 800,000 names. In addition and as expected, China-related weakness continues and contributed to most of the remaining sequential decline in the second quarter. The domain name base from our EMEA region was up slightly during the second quarter. We have rolled out new registrar marketing programs over the past several weeks to support our registrars and our goal of returning to domain name base growth in the second half of 2025. However, given the ongoing impact of the factors we've mentioned, we now expect the change in the domain name base to be between negative 3% to a negative 2% for full year 2024. Our financial and liquidity position continues to remain stable with $690 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $388 million. Effective today, the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for share repurchase of VeriSign common stock by $1.11 billion, to a total of $1.5 billion authorized and available under the share repurchase program, which has no expiration. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to George. I'll return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the company generated revenue of $387 million, up 4.1% from the same quarter of 2023 and delivered operating income of $266 million, an increase of 7.1% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in the second quarter of 2024 totaled $121 million for the 3 months and $246 million for the 6 months ended June 30, which compares to $123 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $246 million for the first 2 quarters a year ago. Net income in the second quarter totaled $199 million compared to $186 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.01 for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $1.79 for the same quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $160 million and free cash flow was $151 million compared with $145 million and $139 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be in the range of $1.553 billion to $1.563 billion. Operating income is now expected to be between $1.048 billion and $1.058 billion. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is still expected to be an expense of between $25 million to $35 million. Capital expenditures are still expected to be between $30 million to $40 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 21% and 24%. Overall, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. While we expect that the change in the domain name base for 2024 will be below prior year levels for the reasons we've discussed, we continue to believe our business fundamentals remain. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to introduce additional registrar marketing programs to target and support improvement in new registration trends once adopted and integrated into registrar our go-to-market activities. Our goals to fulfill our stewardship mission of providing care and reliable infrastructure services, managing our business responsibly and efficiently returning capital to our shareholders remain unchanged and support our commitment to deliver consistent financial results. Thank you for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. I've got a few, and then I'll hop back into the queue. Jim, I guess, the first question would be, you talked a little bit about some of the activity at the registrars, particularly in North America and the focus on ARPU. Can you talk about the view out there that perhaps newer gTLDs are taking share from .com and what you're seeing in the data that gives you either a concern there or that would persuade you from that view? And then I have a couple of others. Jim Bidzos : Okay. So ARPU -- while the primary ARPU is -- the primary factor in the U.S. weakness remains register focus -- register our focus on ARPU and the reduced spend on marketing, two components there. These factors are having a bigger impact and lasting longer than we originally expected earlier this year. The unregulated retail channel has increased prices more than twice our limited wholesale pricing flexibility with some increasing 3x or more. Also, we've seen some registrars focus on margin through price increases to the overall bundle. In addition, they've reduced marketing expenditures. So while our limited price increases on comp may have had an impact, we think the wholesale price impact is small relative to the overall price increases and other actions taken by the unregulated retail channel in the U.S. In relation to the new gTLD taking market share question, very low-cost new gTLDs seem to be picking up some of the monetization demand, primarily from China. I would just add that there's a thriving market of CCTLDs and new gTLDs. There are 33 million of them. But these names tend to have lower renewal rates and lower lifetime values compared to traditional cohorts. Some of these are the more speculative names that we're seeing a declining demand from our China registrar base. And let me remind you that new gTLDs operate under very different and more flexible contracts. They're allowed to offer special deals to individual registrars, some offer very low initial and renewal pricing. They can reserve and sell premiums anytime that they want. They're not as transparent. Very few are public companies. And it's important to note that there's a difference between a registry operator like us and some registries which are really registering marketers. They basically don't run a registry, but they outsource those operations to a back-end service provider who does it for them. So they tend to have very low overhead. Some of them have very, very few employees. They can sell these TLDs at very, very low prices and still be profitable. And again, they're not a public company, so we don't have much visibility, but we can -- we certainly understand that these are factors in the market. So you need to look a little bit closer to get the accurate picture there. Rob Oliver : Got it. Okay. Very helpful, Jim. I appreciate all the color. Two other for me, if I may. The second would be -- so something that just came out today, there was a congressional letter to the NTIA asking for them to review the contract for .com? It's been our understanding that they can ask all they want, but there's no legal ground. But that follows, I guess, an earlier report from a think tank in New York also suggesting the same. So I just wanted to get your reaction to that letter, which came out today? Jim Bidzos : We've seen the letter and the questions to NTIA. So I can't speak for NTIA but our reaction was that questions do typically occur every 6 years around the renewal of the .com registry agreement. Some of the questions in the letter are about wholesale .com price increases. As you know, our pricing is completely transparent and regulated. Since 2018, the com wholesale price has gone up $1.74. Our research shows that the benefit from our cap wholesale prices is not always passed on to consumers, either in a retail market where, as I just mentioned, prices have gone up more than twice as much as the wholesale price increases. Or in the secondary market, where the average price for .com domain is estimated to be $1,600 or about 166 time today's wholesale price. Academic research sizes the secondary market at over $2 billion that's with a B. $2 billion per year, which exceeds VeriSign's revenue. And unlike any actor in the secondary market, you know that VeriSign, as all of you know, VeriSign operates critical infrastructure which helps to enable the global digital economy. We understand that one of these secondary market players has warehoused about 4.8 million .com domains for resale on the secondary market. Businesses that buy these .com domains on the secondary market at high prices pass the cost on to consumers. So while we expect questions about wholesale prices, and we'll do our best to assist it fast by NTIA. The issue of retail, especially secondary market pricing is an important part of the discussion of the com domain name market that hasn't been sufficiently addressed yet. Rob Oliver : Okay, that's extremely helpful. I guess the ultimate question we get most often from investors would be. Is there a risk the .com contract and your most recent thoughts on that would be great? Jim Bidzos : Well, a word, no, there's no -- there's no provision in a cooperative agreement to rebid .com and we believe that Amendment 35 is clear that should the DOC decide to sunset the cooperative agreement, which we're not seeking, then VeriSign would continue to operate the com Registry under the ICANN contract which like all ICANN agreements as a presumptive right of renewal. Rob Oliver : Okay, that's really helpful. I have -- you know if you one or two others, but I'll hop back in the queue. So I appreciate it. Operator : Will take our next question from Ygal Arounian with Citigroup. Ygal Arounian : Similarly, we've lately been getting most of our questions around the agreements, both NTIA [ph] with ICANN and the Cooperative Agreement with Department of Commerce. So maybe just an opportunity to clarify; these are two separate contracts, are they interrelated at all? The date that -- the DOC would have to -- to give you notice on whether -- if they're not doing the cooperative agreement; is that August 2? Just to clarify. And then the part that people, I guess, investors are most confused about lately is where the pricing part of the contract sits. Does that sit with the Department of Commerce? Does that sit within the ICANN contract? Meaning, if the Department of Commerce on sets the cooperative agreement; what happens for the pricing? Where does that get negotiated regardless? Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks, Ygal. So maybe it would just be helpful if I briefly covered that the two contracts are at a very high level and briefly on the interest of time and what their interrelationship is. I think that was the first thing that you asked me. So the Cooperative Agreement is between VeriSign and the NTI Department of Commerce. And that contract in the past prior to 2018 was a contract that oversaw the conditions of renewal with our registry agreement with ICANN. So after we negotiated with ICANN to exercise our presumptive right of renewal, the NTIA had to approve what we did. In 2018, Amendment 35 basically gave ongoing priority consent to do that provided that we didn't change certain provisions of the registry agreement with ICANN. The first one was that we not change the termination provisions, not change the performance requirements that we had to deliver and not change the pricing. And so that pricing in 2018 is a limited ability to raise prices. And through Amendment 3 to the contract with ICANN, that new pricing that was permitted in 2018 is now part of the com registry agreement. So therefore, the Cooperative Agreement has 3 outcomes. One is that as it's coming up for renewal here. Renewal is sort of a different word. It's not quite like the ICANN agreement. The Department of Commerce has the unilateral right to sunset the Cooperative Agreement if it chooses to and that has to give notice that it intends to do so. We don't see -- by the way, the sunset. I think renewal is sort of a strange. It's an evergreen renewal. If nothing is done, the contract automatically renews under the exact same provisions that it has, which is that we can get our business done with ICANN and renew the com agreement provided we don't change those 3 things, which we never seek to do. However, as I said, they could sunset it and they have to give notice, and I believe that's the right date. I don't -- I haven't looked at part of the contract in a while, but I think that August date is the right one. So if they choose to sunset it, they have to give notice, and I believe that's the date by which they must give notice so that the contract, which will either expire or renew that would be at the end of November. So if they want to sunset it, they would give notice by August 2. If they do nothing, the contract will automatically renew for another 6 years with all of its provisions intact. Those are the outcomes that can't be changed unless we mutually agree to whatever changes. So that's the cooperative agreement, the ICANN agreement. Although separate, as you can see now, requires that we don't change those 3 things, which we never seek to do. And with ICANN, like every one of the hundreds, actually thousands of registry agreements, they all contain a presumptive right of renewal. And that we've exercised most recently with .net, relatively straightforward renewal. And I think we got a question on the last call, so maybe I'll anticipate that you're thinking it. We are engaged with ICANN. We are very much engaged in preparing the .com registry renewal, which comes up for renewal by November 30. So we're well in advance of that, and we're working on it. I hope that answers your question. Ygal Arounian : It does. I know it's a multi-part of the question. Just to be clear, again, the pricing -- the wholesale pricing component right now sits between the VeriSign and ICANN in the registry agreement. Is that correct? Jim Bidzos : Well, it was negotiated with the Department of Commerce in 2018 and through Amendment 3 in 2020; it was moved into the com agreement as it's required to do. Those changes in the Cooperative Agreement pass on. So and we can't change them in our negotiations with ICANN. So they stay as does the performance requirements and as do the termination provisions. And you can see how all those work together. Ygal Arounian : Yes, understood. There's a lot of legal elements here; so that's\u2026 Jim Bidzos : It's a bit tricky, but -- yes. No, I understand. But if you look carefully at the different components, the outcomes sort of are pretty straightforward. Ygal Arounian : Yes, understood. And that's really helpful clarification. I want to ask about -- I want to ask about the marketing that you're doing with registrars in the U.S. I know you're saying it's just a couple of weeks, but maybe there is -- and the outcome is not going to come until next year, but maybe there's a little bit, so you can -- a little bit of color that you can add on what you're doing there or what the receptiveness has been from the registrars? So anything that would be helpful. Jim Bidzos : Sure. George is taking a lead on that. So, George? George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim. So Ygal, as we mentioned last quarter, in addition to the annual marketing programs that we launched at the beginning of the year, we have rolled out some new programs. During late Q2, we launched some new programs on .net. And this quarter, we've rolled out some programs to the registrar community on .com. Again, our strategy is really to broaden the options that registrars can choose from, depending on their different business models, geographic footprints and installed bases. I would say the initial feedback has been positive to those programs but it is early. And of course, while we've had, I think, some good registrar engagement there, it will take a little bit of time to registrars to work those programs into their go-to-market strategies. So still early days, but we've gotten some actual feedback. And as you may also know, we will start working here in the fourth quarter to modify and enhance and target additional programs for 2025. We tend to gear that up in the fourth quarter and begin to talk to registrars about those programs as well. So any of the programs that we've rolled out better that we get feedback on, we'll look to try to tweak those to make sure that they work best for the registrar community. Ygal Arounian : All right. And I'll ask one last one. Just on the updated gain guidance. You're giving down 3% at the low end, that would -- based on the first half, the current trends, that would seem to imply trends get worse, not continue at the current level. So just want to know how to think about that number? Is it just incremental caution around the trends? What is it something you're seeing or what needs to happen to get -- go from down 2 to down 3. What's contemplated there? George Kilguss : Yes, sure. So if you look -- simply, if you look at the first half of the year, we're for the first 6 months, we're down about 2 million names. And so the midpoint of our guidance suggests that, that trend is probably going to continue here for the second half. Having said that, on the upside if some of our marketing programs start taking root or as Jim mentioned, if registrars stop being as aggressive in the marketplace with ARPU or there has been some recent news out of China where the Chinese government has put some stimulus into that marketplace, if those things start to take root, I think those are positive and can close that gap a little bit for us on the downside to the extent any of those trends worsen, i.e., the China market continues to not turn around or worsens and renewal rates from some of the activities [ph] continuing to exercise their pricing flexibility weaken that could potentially get to the bottom of that range. But right now, I think the simplest thing the midpoint of our guidance suggests that the second half will be similar to the first half of this year. Jim Bidzos : This is Jim. I just -- there's a couple of other things in the Cooperative Agreement that can't be changed. We normally don't think of them because they aren't generally of interest to investors. But I think everybody is aware of them. But one is that we cannot be vertically integrated for .com. We cannot be our own registrar for .com. And I think you might recall that in Amendment 35, we got clarification that only applies to .com. So we don't have any plans to become a registrar for anything, but there is a restriction in the Cooperative Agreement has been forever that we cannot -- for quite a few years that we could not be our own registrar for .com. And there's a function called who is, where people can query registrations and there are some requirements to continue to support that. Just for all clarity, I think there's one more technical one, but it's all in Amendment 35, pretty easy to find. But I think the important ones for investors are pricing SLA, the service level agreement, the performance and termination. And we don't see -- and by the way, we don't see to change any of the other ones either since we got clarification on a vertical integration, there's really nothing in the cooperative agreement that we would seek to change and we don't see [indiscernible] termination or sunset. Ygal Arounian : Got it. Thanks for the clarification. Operator : We will take our last question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Thanks for squeezing me in for one more. Jim or George, just a question on capital allocation. I saw you guys re-up to the buyback. I guess, Jim, just thinking about your time since returning to VeriSign, you essentially unwound and so many of the noncore businesses and which our view has been, this is a tremendous competitive advantage for you guys. However, it was interesting in response to Ygal's question, what you just said about vertical integration because, yes, clearly, you can't do that with .com. But just wondering the extent to which the current malaise in .com growth and some of the activity with new gTLDs, coupled with a very strong financial position that you guys have might cause you to rethink your capital allocation strategy, either via M&A or getting more aggressive with the new gTLD market or in any other way? Jim Bidzos : It's a good question. We don't guide to any of those things. I'd be reluctant to say anything about it. Now we do -- I will say though that, as you're aware, we have pursued growth through the pursuit of a new TLD .web, and that continues, of course, in litigation, and there's no update, unfortunately, this quarter. But I think that adding a new TLD and giving our customers more choice was a good plan, a good growth plan for us. But also to remember that our primary mission, the 328 billion queries a day and delivering that and having delivered it for 27 years is a primary mission. We have a strategic framework that balances growth against meeting our SLAs, which is obviously a very important thing. So we certainly have the flexibility to become a registrar for .web, if we wanted to. But all the other things that you mentioned, and we have no intention of doing that. But the other things that you mentioned, we wouldn't guide to and are complicated processes. All I can say is that if you look at our long track record of capital allocation, as you can see from our financial results today it's serving us well. Operator : This does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to David Atchley for final remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening.

Recording of this call is not permitted unless preauthorized. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Atchley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Welcome to VeriSign's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me are Jim Bidzos, Executive Chairman, President and CEO; and George Kilguss, Executive Vice President and CFO. This call and presentation are being webcast from the Investor Relations website, which is available under About VeriSign on verisign.com. There, you will also find our earnings release. At the end of this call, the presentation will be available on that site, and within a few hours, the replay of the call will be posted. Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent report on Form 10-K. VeriSign does not update financial performance or guidance during the quarter unless it is done through a public disclosure. The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP results and two non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation information is appended to the slide presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website available after this call. Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks. And afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Good afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. Just an apology here before I start that I might sneeze somewhere along the way, a little bit of the allergy effect today. We delivered another quarter of operational and financial stability by focusing on our mission as a critical Internet infrastructure operator. Also, we extended our unparalleled 27 years of 100% uninterrupted availability for the common net domain name resolution system. For the third quarter, revenues grew 3.8% year-over-year, operating income grew 5.9% year-over-year and earnings per share grew 13.1% year-over-year. At the end of September, the domain name basin dotcom and dot net totaled 169.6 million domain names. During the third quarter, the domain name base decreased by 1.1 million names. From a new registration perspective, the third quarter ended with 9.3 million new registrations compared with 9.9 million names for the same quarter last year. The renewal rate for the third quarter of 2024 is expected to be approximately 72.3% compared to 73.5% a year ago. As we have previously reported, we continue to see U.S. registrars prioritize ARPU over customer acquisition through higher retail pricing levels, increased focus on aftermarket sales and reduced spend on marketing to new customers compared with prior years. In addition, and as expected, China-related weakness continues. These factors are impacting new registrations and renewal rates in 2024. During the third quarter, the U.S. region was lower by approximately 850,000 names. China-related weakness contributed to most of the remaining sequential decline in the third quarter. The domain name base from our EMEA region was up nearly 200,000 names during the third quarter. As we've noted in our prior earnings calls, we have been developing and piloting new registrar marketing programs with our channel to support our goal of returning to domain name base growth. While we have seen good response to our new programs, it does take time for registrars to adopt and integrate them into their sales cycle. As a result, many are looking towards 2025 to engage more fully. Accordingly and with current trends persisting returning the entire DNB to growth in the second half of 2025 may be more challenging. With that being said, we're doing what we can to help refocus the registrars towards higher renewal rate cohorts with our new programs, and we will provide full year guidance for 2025 during our February earnings call. With the current trends tracking in line with our forecast from last quarter, we are narrowing our expectations for the change in the domain name base to be between negative 2.9% and negative 2.3% for full year 2024, decreasing the midpoint by 10 basis points. Moving now to the company's contracts. On September 26, ICANN posted the revised com registry agreement for public comment. The comment period runs through November 5. The current .com registry agreement expires November 30, and we expect the renewal process to be completed by that date. Also, as we previously disclosed, we have agreed to discussions with the NTIA regarding dotcom pricing and the health of the dotcom ecosystem. Dotcom ecosystem includes the retail and secondary markets as part of possible mutually agreed solutions that serve the public interest and benefit end users, especially businesses and consumers. These discussions are separate from the com registry agreement renewal process with ICANN. We're engaged with the NTIA now in these discussions, but we have no further update at this time. Our financial and liquidity position continues to remain stable at $645 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million shares for $301 million. At quarter end, $1.28 billion remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program. And now I'd like to turn the call over to George, I'll return when George has completed his report with closing remarks. George? George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the company generated revenue of $391 million, up 3.8% from the same quarter of 2023 and delivered operating income of $269 million, an increase of 5.9% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in Q3 2024 totaled $121 million and $368 million for the nine months ended September 30, which compares to $122 million in Q3 2023 and $368 million for the first three quarters of 2023. Net income in the third quarter totaled $201 million compared to $188 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2.07 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.83 for the same quarter of 2023. Operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2024 was $253 million and free cash flow was $248 million compared with $245 million and $217 million, respectively, in the year ago quarter. I'll now discuss our updated full year 2024 guidance. Revenue is now expected to be between $1.554 billion and $1.559 billion. Operating income is now expected to be between $1.054 billion and $1.059 billion. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates is now expected to be an expense of between $32 million and $42 million. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $25 million and $35 million, and the GAAP effective tax rate is still expected to be between 21% and 24%. Overall, VeriSign continued to demonstrate sound financial discipline during the quarter. Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. In closing, and especially for those who may be new to VeriSign, I'd like to say more about what we do and what it takes to deliver 27 years of uninterrupted DNS availability for common net. We recently published a blog myths versus facts about VeriSign. In it, we refer to our infrastructure, which is better described as a complex system comprised of many critical components. We often describe it as a proprietary purpose-built network. Let me briefly describe and expand some of what's behind that. First, an important part of what makes our system unique is our multiple redundant data centers that can receive, process and immediately distribute globally, millions of updates to registration data all that can happen in under 20 seconds and arrive at our global resolution constellation. And then we can immediately reply to queries within milliseconds anywhere in the world. We also maintained to the maximum extent possible, control of the remote sites from hardware and firmware up allowing for better security practices such as firmware, boot loader and code verification single-purpose proprietary and optimized DNS processing, which provides additional layers of protection against cyberattacks, elimination of shared services, meaning dedicated capacity and no multi-tenancy for networks or compute resources throughout the entire system, which is one reason we do not rely on public cloud services but have developed our own purpose-built private cloud infrastructure. Network compute and all other resources are dedicated to delivering on our core mission registry, resolution and route services. This allows us to mitigate risks such as collateral damage that arise in public cloud infrastructure with service locations in more than 60 countries in data centers we wholly own or secure colocation space as we lease the entire system was designed with maximum diversity that includes operating systems, compute, network and security hardware, transit providers and more. And overcapacity measured in orders of magnitude. The most critical component of our system is the 600-plus skilled engineers cybersecurity, InfoSec and DNS specialists that maintain, operate and protect it, that and a lot more that we don't talk publicly about is what it takes to achieve an unparalleled 100% availability record of 27-plus years spanning four decades, processing on average, hundreds of billions of transactions per day. Critical infrastructure that has reliant parties counted in the billions, users, devices and more around the world, and it deserves no less. Every quarter, you hear me thank our teams for their commitment and dedication to our mission. Delivering this level of performance and reliability as a source of pride and deep responsibility for our employees. Thanks for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks. Now we'll open the call for your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Jim, I want to touch on your comments relative to the channel marketing efforts that you guys are engaged in. The registers prioritization of ARPU in this environment is not new, and I know initially when you guys rolled out these or announced the rollout of these plans, your hope was to grow domains in '25, it certainly sounds like you're less confident about that now. So I just wanted to get an update from you on how those plans are going if you've needed to tweak them at all or any color you could provide, unless something's changed at the registrar end that we're missing, how you guys are pivoting or adjusting to try to reaccelerate that growth in '25. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks, Rob. So correct me if I'm wrong, I think I heard two questions in there. One is -- one was about ARPU and the other one is about, call it, slipping into 2025. Is that fair? Is that kind of your question? Rob Oliver : Well, I think -- well, you -- really, it's more the slip beyond '25 because I think the prioritization of ARPU is something that you guys have talked about, and we've seen at the registrars, unless there's a change there, I guess, so that's half a question, James, please. Jim Bidzos : Yeah. Well, let me take them in reverse order then. When we're talking about the programs moving into 2025, the registrars are not able to engage quickly enough to put the programs into effect. So we see some of that slipping from '24 into '25 and therefore, we're pushing out a little further and saying that could impact our goal of returning to growth in the second half of 2025. Your second question about ARPU is we see clear indications of the registrars that are public companies. They've been very clear about a lot of their improvements and their performance coming from increased retail prices and higher average resale domains. GoDaddy disclosed recently that their resell revenue is in excess of $100 million per quarter. So that's the kind of ARPU that certainly understandable that they're pursuing it, but we still believe that ARPU is cyclical. And at some point, our return to customer acquisition is important. And I'll invite George to add any more color if you care to, but -- George Kilguss : Yeah, I think that's right, Jim. Rob, as Jim mentioned in the prepared remarks, we were down about $1.1 million in the quarter. 850 from the U.S. was the largest component there. And over the past few quarters, as you alluded to, we have seen U.S. registrars focus shift towards improving their profitability, and they're really doing that, three ways. One is, they've been raising retail prices to they have, as Jim alluded to, also, been focusing on the increased aftermarket sales, which they're basically marking up and selling currently owned inventory of premium names at premium prices. And so while that generates substantial revenue for them, on a per domain name basis, the registry doesn't obviously get compensated in that environment. And lastly, they've been reducing their marketing spend there. So that's really the headwind with ARPU in the U.S. markets. As far as China is concerned, we continue to see a weak macroeconomic environment there. We've also seen some increased regulation over there as well. And while Q3 was -- the sequential decline was a little bit less in Q3 from China, we still haven't seen any material change there. So right now, we don't expect that market to have turned the corner just yet. So -- but we're keeping an eye on it. Rob Oliver : That's helpful. My second question was on China. So if I could just pick that up, George, that's helpful. Do you guys expect or can you update us on your thought relative to how or if you stand a benefit if we do see kind of continued uptick in economic activity in China. In other words, certainly, there's a cyclical element that you guys have, I think, helped the pain from. There's also been as you pointed out some regulatory issues, regulation. But I guess one thing we hear from investors often is sort of secular versus cyclical. So do we -- do you guys expect to benefit in China as or if we see economic activity in China rebound? George Kilguss : Yeah. I can just tell you historically, when the China economy was doing better we also benefited as far as how that dynamic has changed, we're keeping an eye on it. Some of our registrars did pilot a few of our programs last quarter, and we're pleased with the results. So we're engaging with them and other registrars into 2025 to engage with our programs, and we hope that those will benefit us in 2025. Rob Oliver : Got it. And then last one for me, George, also for you, just on that call that. So there was some outperformance on the operating income side relative to the -- at least the two estimates that are out there. But just curious, as you look at what potentially is these ongoing efforts on the marketing side, how we should think about the potential impact to costs? Or are those rationalized certainly through the end of '24. And how we might think about them not asking you to guide the cost for '25, but how we might think about the potential for incremental costs on these channel marketing efforts. Thanks. George Kilguss : Yeah, a couple of things. I mean if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, it would imply that we're going to probably spend a little bit more here in Q4. If you look at our head count trends, we were able to hire about 12 people in the quarter, finding the right people to align with our mission and the skill sets that we need takes a little bit of time, and we've been looking for those people. So some of the investments that we've been trying to make this year have been pushed a little bit into the fourth quarter. We expect -- I would expect expenses to grow more in 2025 than they have in 2024. And we'll give you guidance next quarter on that. As it relates to marketing programs, we're always trying to make sure that the marketing programs are accretive to our business. And so to the extent that we're finding success in our programs, we're probably going to lean more into them and invest more in those programs, but we believe they'll be accretive, if you find they're not accretive, then you'll probably see us pull back on a few of those programs. So clearly, we're trying to drive profitable growth as we have been for a number of years for the company. Rob Oliver : That\u2019s great. Appreciate all the time. Thanks. George Kilguss : Thank you. Operator : Will take our last question from Max Moore with Citi. Max Moore : Good afternoon guys. Appreciate taking my question. Don't worry, they will be back next quarter. I guess just maybe looking at capital allocation and buybacks. This year is tracking, I think, be one of your largest ever on buybacks. So just how should we think about kind of the pace of buybacks from here? And then also, would you consider just given the amount of free cash you have consider anything on the leverage side, maybe lever up to increase the pace of buyback.. Jim Bidzos : Well, let me respond to your question and invite George afterwards as well. On a part of it certainly about leverage I think you could probably determine from my comments about our operations that I've provided a little bit more color on. We're very careful and conservative about approach to cybersecurity. That also applies to financial stability. We're very cautious. We're not over levered. There's a lot of reasons for that. We -- there are a variety of factors. We just have -- financial stability and operational stability, security and stability and the infrastructure that we operate, all those things to us are the same thing -- it's all part of the company's stability. We obviously don't -- we are not as leveraged as we possibly could be, and we believe, certainly, that's not a priority for us and that's not something that we're going to do. We don't guide to buybacks. Obviously, historically, you've seen what we've done. George, I'd like you to comment further. George Kilguss : Yeah, Max. I mean, I think, look, we're trying to return excess cash to shareholders in the most efficient way possible. We've been doing that for a number of years. We'll continue to evaluate the methods and the ways to do that and the appropriate amounts based on our plans and our investment strategy. So -- as Jim said, we don't guide to it, but we try to -- I would just look historically what we've done. And if our philosophy change, we'll communicate it to you. Max Moore : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just on some of the marketing initiatives. I don't know if you've given some examples of some of the programs you are looking to implement, but if there's any color there you could share, that would be helpful. George Kilguss : Yeah. As we've mentioned, I think in summary, we've really been looking to give more choice to registrars that have potentially different go-to-market strategies, while I'd rather not provide specifics for competitive reasons, an example of choice could be offering multiple programs that should appeal to registrars that are looking to sell more product or TLDs to existing customers. And then there are some programs that we're looking to appeal to registrars that maybe prefer new customer acquisition. But we're also trying to align these programs with registrar's goals of pursuing higher renewal rate cohorts. And to the extent we can find those win-win opportunities, we think we'll be successful in that effort. Max Moore : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to David Atchley for any additional or closing remarks. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. Have a good evening. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Jim and George will provide some prepared remarks, and afterward, we will open the call for your questions. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, David. Afternoon to everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased with VeriSign, Inc.'s success in continuing to deliver on our mission during 2024. We extended our unparalleled record of uninterrupted .com and .net resolution to more than 27 years, in an increasingly evolving cyber threat environment while protecting, improving, and strengthening our network. VeriSign, Inc.'s network now processes, on average, more than 400 billion transactions daily. Our focus remains on providing the security, stability, and resiliency Internet users worldwide have come to depend on not only for .com and .net but for the DNS root zone as well. Financially, in 2024, we delivered 4.3% year-over-year revenue growth while increasing operating income by 5.7%. Shares outstanding at the end of 2024 decreased by 6.2% from the total of outstanding shares at the end of 2023. Our financial and liquidity position continues to remain stable with $600 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities at the end of the year. During 2024, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders through the repurchase of 6.6 million shares. At year-end, $1 billion remained available and authorized under the current share repurchase program, which has no expiration. At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net totaled 169 million domain names, a decrease of 2.1% or 3.7 million names year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, the domain name base decreased by 500,000 names. From a new registration perspective, we saw improvements sequentially and year-over-year, with fourth quarter new registrations of 9.5 million compared with 9 million names for the same quarter last year and 9.3 million during the third quarter of 2024. The renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2024, which is expected to be approximately 73.9%, shows improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. From a geographic region perspective during Q4, and the full year 2024, we saw decreases in the domain name base from both our US and China-based registrars. The domain name base in EMEA was up both sequentially and for the full year 2024. In 2024, the decrease in China volumes was in line with our expectations at the start of the year. For 2025, we continue to expect our China registrar segment to decline, albeit at a slower pace. As that segment now represents only 5% of our domain name base, the decrease from China will have a smaller impact. As we have previously reported, we have seen US registrars, through higher retail pricing levels, reduce spend on marketing to new customers compared with prior years, and an increased focus on the secondary market for domain names. These factors impacted new registrations and renewal rates in 2024 for our US region. In response to these trends, we began working to reengage registrars on new customer acquisition by launching new marketing programs for .com and .net to support our goal of returning to domain name base growth. We stated last quarter, we have seen positive response to our new programs, and we expect many of the registrars to engage more fully in 2025. It is early in this process, but we are optimistic that our efforts will start to improve the DMV growth trend in 2025. Given these conditions and trends for 2025, we are expecting the year-over-year change in the base to be negative 2.3% to negative 0.3%. And now I would like to turn the call over to George. Return when George has completed his financial report with closing remarks. George Kilguss : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company generated revenue of $1.557 billion, up 4.3%. Operating expenses totaled $499 million and were up 1.4% from the previous year, resulting in operating income of $1.058 billion, up 5.7% from 2023. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024, the company generated revenue of $395 million, up 3.9% from the same quarter of 2023, and delivered operating income of $264 million, an increase of 2.9% from the same quarter a year ago. Operating expense in Q4 2024 totaled $132 million, which compares to $121 million during the third quarter and $124 million a year earlier. As we discussed on our last quarter's earnings call, we expected an increase in Q4 operating expenses due to prior quarter spending delays. Net income in the fourth quarter totaled $191 million compared to $265 million a year earlier, which produced diluted earnings per share of $2 for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $2.60 for the same quarter of 2023. As previously discussed, net income in the fourth quarter of last year included the recognition of $69.3 million of income tax benefits, which increased diluted earnings per share by $0.68 in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $232 million, and free cash flow was $222 million compared with $204 million and $199 million, respectively, in the year-ago quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the full year of 2024 totaled $903 million and $875 million, respectively. I will now discuss our full year 2025 guidance. Revenue is expected to be between $1.615 billion and $1.635 billion. Operating income is expected to be between $1.095 billion and $1.115 billion. Interest expense and non-operating income net, which includes interest income estimates, is expected to be an expense of between $50 million and $60 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $30 million and $40 million. And the GAAP effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 24%. Overall, VeriSign, Inc. continued to demonstrate sound financial discipline during the fourth quarter and throughout 2024. Now I will return the call back to Jim for his closing remarks. Jim Bidzos : Thank you, George. In summary, VeriSign, Inc. successfully concluded the year by renewing the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN and the cooperative agreement with the NTIA. We extended our unparalleled 27-year track record of resolution availability for .com and .net, and we delivered sound financial and operational results. As we look to 2025 and beyond, we will continue to focus on and be driven by our mission. It relates to the domain name base growth rate. For 2025, we see three positive trends taking shape. First, the decrease from China-based registrars is expected to be more muted. Second, the marketing programs we rolled out in 2024 and continue to offer for 2025 are being adopted by our registrars. Finally, while it is early in the cyclical trend, we do expect registrars to start refocusing on customer acquisition and are starting to hear from some registrars an expectation for increased marketing efforts in 2025. Although we expect a slight decline in the domain name base in 2025, we do expect trends to improve from what we saw in 2024. Thank you for your attention today. This concludes our prepared remarks. And now we will open the call for your questions. Operator, we are ready for the first question. Operator : Thank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touch-tone telephone. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Please mute your line. Again, that is star one if you would like to signal with questions. Operator : And we will take a question from Rob Oliver with Baird. Rob Oliver : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. I had a couple of questions. Jim, first for you. In your closing remarks there, you mentioned it was a big year for you guys last year with the ICANN renewal as well as the cooperative agreement at the NTIA. And certainly, the investor focus now is pivoted towards the domain base, and you finished with three points as to why you are more optimistic on that. I guess, from your perspective, maybe looking at the macro as well in addition to those three points, if you could give us some more color on the three, but also just around the macro. Generally, I know you mentioned that you suspected that some of the registrars might be pivoting more towards new domains, which would be very encouraging. What gives you that comfort? And then I had a couple of follow-ups. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks, Rob. Well, as you know, today, we guided the domain name base continuing to decrease during this year, 2025. Although, the midpoint of our range suggests an improving trend from what we saw last year. We do see the trends that have a negative impact as cyclical in nature, and we do expect the domain name base to return to growth once we work through those trends. As I said earlier, China is lessening and now only represents 5% of our business. Also, our new marketing programs are being adopted. We are seeing positive impact from them. It is early. We expect more throughout the year. Finally, while it is early in a cyclical trend, we do expect registrars to start refocusing on customer acquisition and are starting to hear from registrars, like I said, an expectation for increased marketing efforts. In fact, I would point out that two registrars are running Super Bowl ads, which will reach around 200 million viewers. So as you look back, the two main trends we called out, China and ARPU, were impacting the DNA DNB. And both seem to be easing. And where we could influence through marketing programs, there are encouraging signs. And also renewal rates have improved. So that is the picture we see. Rob Oliver : And on those marketing programs, Jim, if you could just provide a little bit more color perhaps on if there are particular regions where you guys are seeing early traction? I know you have said it is still early and the results will not be immediate, we get that, or perhaps this is for George. But any particular areas where you are seeing early signs that the marketing programs are starting to take hold or conversely where you had to tweak them and feel comfortable that you now have the formula right? Any color there would be great. Jim Bidzos : Okay. I will invite George to comment. I will just say that, you know, it takes time to get these things integrated. There is adoption, integration, and there is actual performance. So it may be early to give you a clear picture of where we are, but we do see... George Kilguss : Yeah. Sure, Rob. I mean, as we have mentioned, the focus of our new programs is really to offer more options for our registered community to help them engage in a variety of programs that really are more aligned with their particular go-to-market strategies. So again, looking for opportunities for a win-win. As we talked about in 2024, we spent a lot of time developing and piloting a lot of these programs. We have gotten feedback. We have also refined and recently relaunched these programs late in 2024 here. We actually had a few programs that we rolled out here early in January as well. Again, from a little color, when we talk to registrars, we have gotten a lot of positive feedback from registrars that our programs are aligning with strategies that they are employing, and they feel they can use these programs within their own marketing programs. So that is good news for us. You know, as far as early adoption, I would say it is a little early right now. Most registrars are just starting to roll out there. Even though we have had these programs launched late last year and we have gotten good feedback and we have modified some of them, they are really gearing up to roll them out here in 2025. Some registrars do engage a little earlier than others, but I think it is a little early for us to comment on that. But we are optimistic about the programs we have rolled out. We have gotten great feedback. Rob Oliver : Great. That is helpful. And then the last one for me, Jim, back to you. Just we have got a couple of leadership changes happening. One obvious one, we have a new administration in DC. So we would be curious to hear from you what, if anything, you might expect or how we should think about that relative to VeriSign, Inc.'s business and, you know, number one. Number two, are discussions with the NTIA ongoing? I know that the NTIA obviously dictated did not ultimately request any changes. But, you know, you guys had agreed to sit down with them, so I would be curious to hear whether those discussions are ongoing. And then we have a new head of ICANN that came in in December. Any thoughts there would be helpful. I realize that is a lot. Thank you guys very much. Jim Bidzos : Okay. Thanks, Rob. Well, first of all, I would just point out that where we are today, VeriSign, Inc., the cooperative agreement, ICANN, this whole process is a result of decades of very successful policy across many different administrations of many political stripes. So we tend to sort of see that as not directly impacting factor, just a long-supported consistent policy with security and stability as the main driver. And as you mentioned, there are new folks in December. Of course, we have a new CEO in ICANN, and we will be getting a new NTIA administrator shortly, we believe. And we look we have great relationships with both organizations, and we look forward to continuing them. We have always maintained a good working relationship with ICANN for many decades, and we look forward to working with the new CEO, Curtis Linfist, and his leadership team, particularly in the areas we engage in mostly, which is security and stability of the DNS and DNS abuse. About the second part of your question, ongoing discussions with the NTIA, that is typical for our relationship. We look forward to working with the new NTIA assistant secretary, a partner confirmation, I look forward to meeting her. I think until then, I will not speculate. But let me add some background that might be a little bit helpful there. First, the cooperative agreement has long contained, as I think most of the listeners here know, strict requirements that VeriSign, Inc. meet the most rigorous availability and performance specifications of any TLD due to the reliance services and infrastructure on .com and .net. In 2018, amendment 35 retained these provisions. And while there was reduced regulation, there was also explicit protection for registrant first amendment rights by guaranteeing that the .com registry will remain content neutral. These and the other policies in a 2018 amendment have proven in the last six years to be successful in continuing the policy of security and stability. And resilience first and the critical importance of .com to the security and stability of the infrastructure that is literally critical to the digital economy of the US. And finally, I will just mention that the recent .com renewals enabled us to clear up some misinformation that was spread during that process. One, for example, is that we received money from the government, which simply is not true. Our cooperative agreement is not a procurement contract, and the US government does not fund VeriSign, Inc. for the secure and reliable Internet service that VeriSign, Inc. helps to preserve every day and has without interruption for 27 years. And as I mentioned, now processing an average of over 400 billion transactions every day, by the way, is 40 times the number of daily average Google searches. 40x there was a lot of misinformation about our pricing as well. As you know, our pricing is capped and it is transparent. It is a simple fact that our limited pricing flexibility at the wholesale level has not kept up with global CPI over the last six years. While at the same time, we have seen the unregulated retail price increases exceed our wholesale price increases. So, hopefully, that bit is helpful. Look forward to engaging with our new regulators, and we look forward to... Rob Oliver : Great. Okay. I am going to go back and need to read that transcript. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate that, Jeff. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : Sure. Operator : And we will take our last question from Ygal Aronian with Citi. Ygal Aronian : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Let me start on just coming back to the comments on the cyclical trends, that you are expecting from the registrar is to kind of go back and be a little bit more focused on the broader top of the funnel customer acquisition. And it sounds like what you guys were trying to accomplish with the marketing programs, but it also sounds like you are talking about both of those points as two distinct things. Is that true? And if, you know, for moving back in that part of the cyclical part of the cycle or why are the marketing programs important? Does it kind of help amplify that move back up cycle? Jim Bidzos : I think if I understood the question, it is if a cyclical turn is coming, why the programs? Is that a hope that is not an unfair summary. Ygal Aronian : Okay. I guess are they two distinct points? And if yes, then why the... Jim Bidzos : Yeah. So, okay. I would say two things. That we brought up in the past. First of all, we pointed out that the programs were actually being designed as a response to the evolving nature and structure of our channel. We got a lot of website owners who have become registrars. They have different business models. There are more of them. Some are large, some are small. So designing programs that met their needs and gave them flexibility as opposed to and I will generalize a bit here, you know, the one size fits all that we kind of used in the past, that was a primary motivator. And when we talked about the cyclical trend from ARPU back to customer acquisition, I think I remember a quarter or two ago saying that we would focus on programs and that we hope to get a tailwind from a return acquisition. So I do not think those it is not sort of one or the other. We certainly can do both because they are really for different reasons. Some of the programs maybe can incentivize a shift away from ARPU, but I do not think that has the same effect as giving our registrars the choice that the diverse nature of that channel is going to require. George, do you have any comment? George Kilguss : I would just say, Ygal, you know, look at we clearly have a good channel. We want the stronger we can make that channel, the better it is for us. And so we are trying to support that channel because they are evolving, they have different needs, and sometimes, some of our previous programs may not have fit the needs of all registrars. We are taking that feedback. We are helping them. We are also trying to help them target registrations, new registrations to high renewal rate cohorts. Which would be good for them and good for us. And so as Jim said, the channel continues to evolve. The market continues to evolve. And we believe we need to continue to do the same to support the channel. Jim Bidzos : I guess one last thing I might add here is that we said, I think George mentioned in his remarks that we are seeing take up in the channel. I think this is a result of offering more flexibility and choice in our programs. In the past, when we had a fairly straightforward simple program offered to all. We saw that it worked for some and did not work for some. And what the feedback we are getting is that these choices are great, and they are finding programs that work for them. That is the initial take up. We will see where it goes. Of course, we will work hard to support them, but, you know, that is something we can put some energy into and hopefully get a return. But I would say ARPU is a cyclical tailwind in a sense. There is less we can influence there. We can benefit from it. And we are seeing signs that that shift is occurring as well. Ygal Aronian : Okay. Very helpful. A quick follow-up on that. Is it just a shift in strategy, or are you spending more on the marketing programs that maybe just if you could talk about how that is embedded in the operating income guidance for the year. George Kilguss : Yeah. I would say, primarily, it is a shift in strategy. Having said that, a lot of our programs are success-based. So if they are extremely successful, we will spend more, but those should be accretive to us over time. But it really is a shift to strategy recognizing the changing channel and trying to support them in their different strategies. Jim Bidzos : And the expense of all those programs is baked into our guidance. I would just add. Ygal Aronian : Okay. Alright. Helpful. I have two more, if you do not mind. One is the gross new registrations number was, if my numbers are right, the largest one since Q2 2021. Or year on the year-over-year growth. Sorry. Can you talk about that? What you are seeing there? And that is a pretty impressive number in the quarter. I know the renewal rates are still a little bit below where they are normally. But if you look at the gross numbers, it looks like some of the cyclicality is already coming back here in Q4. George Kilguss : Yeah. As you point out, Ygal, we did 9.5 million new registrations, up sequentially and also up year-over-year. Again, I would credit some of the early successes to some of the programs we launched in the fourth quarter that supported that. So we saw good engagement from some people. Again, it is only a partial year. And we think, you know, once we get further into the year, we will get more channel partners engaging in these programs, but it is some early successes from those programs. So, you know, not huge numbers, but we are seeing positive trends. And as you saw, and as Jim mentioned, the contraction of the domain name base a half a million dollars. That is, you know, it was 1.1 million down in the third quarter and 1.2 million down in the year-ago fourth quarter. So we saw some improvement here, and that gives some optimism here as we move into 2025. Ygal Aronian : Yeah. Okay. Helpful. And then last maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question. Or auctions coming up for some new generic TLDs later this year. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that. You know, particularly with the way NGTLDs have taken share of total domains over the last decade since they have been introduced. Are you interested in bidding for new domains? Has your strategy changed in the kind of amount of domains you want to be a registry for, especially think about that. And sorry. And within that, maybe you could just give us an update on .web. That is also a new TLD. Thanks. Jim Bidzos : I am glad you mentioned .web because I was going to sort of include that in the answer. We did some years ago, obviously, move to acquire another TLD and expand our portfolio there. So first of all, let me answer them in reverse order. So with .web, we are still very interested in being the registry operator for .web. Although this process has taken quite a few years, we still want to be able to offer .web domains to our customers. The process is still with ICANN, and it is their IRP or roughly translates to arbitration process. And we understand what we have come to understand here recently is that there will be more briefings and hearings in 2025 with a planned final merits hearing currently slated for later 2025. And we think that they are continuing to drag this process out and to abuse ICANN's rules actually is the intention of the competing party. As far as the new round, we are considering looking at it. Tossing ideas around, looking at the potential for applications, but we have nothing to share at this point. Rob Oliver : Alright. For taking fifteen questions from two analysts. Jim Bidzos : Anytime. Operator : And that does conclude the question and answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. David Atchley for final comments. David Atchley : Thank you, operator. Please call the Investor Relations department with any follow-up questions from this call. Thank you for your participation. This concludes our call. A good evening. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day.",
