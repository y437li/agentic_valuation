Welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 24, 2014. Your speakers for today are Randy Arickx, Chuck Stevens and Mary Barra. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the first quarter of 2014. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call live via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive Vice President and CFO. After the presentation portion of the call, we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and  Niharika Ramdev, Vice President Finance and Treasurer, to assist and answering your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Randy. And thanks to everyone joining us today. It\u2019s an understatement to say that the first quarter was challenging for General Motors. As you know we recalled approximately 7 million vehicles in North America and we faced economy instability in some markets across the globe. Nevertheless, the company remained profitable and I am very proud of the way the team has kept its focus on the customer. Now a day goes by that we don\u2019t ask and do what we think is best of our customers, what they need and what they deserve when they buy a GM product. I will touch on all of these points as I review the quarter and update you on the status of the ignition switch issue. After that, Chuck Stevens will take you deeper into our results. Then we will answer as many of your questions as we can. If you turn to Slide 2, you\u2019ll see a summary of our first quarter results. To begin, we delivered 2.4 million vehicles around the world, up 2%. So for the Europe we\u2019re up and we saw record sales in China. This was offset by lower sales in North and South America and in GMIO outside of China. Our global market share was 11.1%, which is down to 2/10 of a point, from a year ago. However, Opel Vauxhall gained its share in 10 European markets including Germany. We also gained one tenth of a point of market share in China, based with the growth of Cadillac in the ongoing success of the Buick and Wuling brand. Turning to net income, we earned approximately $100 million despite $1.3 billion pre-tax charge for product recalls and 400 million special items due to a change in the exchange rate, which we used to measure the financial statements in our Venezuelan subsidiary. Looking next at our EBIT adjusted results; we earned $500 million in the quarter. EBIT adjusted in North America was $600 million which is down from the $1.4 billion we earned a year ago; decline is more than explained by the $1.3 billion recall related charge. Europe incurred incremental restructuring expense this quarter versus a year ago, and lost money as expected. However, Opel Vauxhall was getting stronger, for example revenue in the region was up 7% and Opel\u2019s revenue was up 9% and operating losses had been reduced. Looking down the road, we continue to be encouraged by improving customer sentiment and economic growth in the U.K and key Eurozone market. All of keeps us on track to achieve breakeven the results by mid-decade. In China, our equity income was up about 9%, compared to a year ago, however our consolidated international operations lost money. Stefan Jacoby and his team are actively addressing the issues in this part of the business and we expect improved performance as we move forward. GM South America lost money in the quarter due primarily to restructuring cost in Brazil and the ongoing challenges of Venezuela. Once again, GM Financials delivered strong results earning $200 million before tax and finally our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $200 million, which is significantly up from a year ago. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3, where we have summarized highlights from the quarter. They include our common stock dividend and other examples that underscore the momentum we have in key markets around the world. As I mentioned earlier, GM sales in China set a new record in the first quarter and our 2014 deliveries surpassed 1 million units early in April. This is the earliest that we have moved into the seven figure range. Buick and Wuling are doing particularly well in Cadillac sales more than doubled. At Chevrolet we expect sales growth to accelerate with the introduction of a Trax Crossover, which launches this quarter. The Trax is a key product because Crossover and SUV demand in China is expected to grow at about a 10% annual rate and reach about 7 million units by 2020. In Europe, our improving market position can be traced directly to Opel Mokka and our new Insignia flagship. Cumulative Mokka orders have now surpassed 215,000 units since its launch in the fall of 2012 and the Insignia has topped 85,000 units since its launch in the fall of 2013. In the United States, meanwhile, we earned record average transaction prices in the quarter, which reflects a significant 5,000 year-over-year increase in full size pick-up ATPs according to JP Power estimates. For our plan we\u2019re selling a much richer mix of crew cab and premium contended truck today than we were just a year ago. We\u2019re also starting to see the benefit of the new heavy duty Chevrolet and GMC pick-ups that launched in the first quarter along with our all new full size SUVs. I know many of you are concerned that negative publicity surrounding our recent recalls will slow our momentum in United States. Although it is early it appears we have not experienced the meaningful impact on sales and we continue to be optimistic about 2014 because our award winning new products are performing well and we have more on the way. Our dealers are an important part of this equation as well and we just received more third party proof of just how good they are. And its 2014 U.S. customer service index study JD Power ranked all four GM brands above industry average. Not only that Cadillac was the highest ranked luxury brand and Buick was the highest ranked mainstream brand. Let\u2019s talk more about the recall. I want to begin by stating in no uncertain terms of the ignition switch recall and the factors led up to it are unacceptable to me, to my leadership team and to our Board of Directors. It doesn\u2019t matter if the roots of the issue are more than the decade old. This leadership team is responsible for making things right and we will. To get the job done, we have some of cross functional team of experts to focus on the recall issues, so that rest of the organization can drive the business forward. The Recall team is been thorough aggressive and proactive on behalf of our customers and our stakeholders. As you know former U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas is leading our internal investigation and his investigation is on track. When the facts are in we will be transparent and we will hold ourselves accountable. I also expect to have recommendations from Kenneth Feinberg in approximately the next 45 days. Mr. Kenneth Feinberg\u2019s company will help us evaluate our legal and civic duty. We will work through the issues and update you as soon as we can. As has already been reported we began repairing vehicles earlier this month and we expect our ability to supply repair parts will continue to increase throughout the spring and summer. Consistent with our recent communication to NHTSA, our plan is to produce enough repair parts by October 2014 to have the ability to repair the majority of vehicles impacted by the ignition switch and ignition cylinder recall. Until their vehicles are repaired, we have advised customers to remove all items from their key ring leading the vehicle key to keep option of the window. We have conducted more than 80 individual ignition switch test to demonstrate that the vehicles can be driven safely if these steps are followed. We have also advised customers that when they exit their cars to make sure it is in park or for manual transmissions in reverse gear with the parking brake on. Of course our dealers are empowered to put people in courtesy vehicles or rental cars if that is the right thing to do for the customer. Today GM has provided more than 36,000 loaner or rental vehicles through dealership. Based on the expected timing of customers coming to the dealership and the need for loaners should be significantly reduced by the end of the third quarter. The cost to replace the ignition switches in the cylinder and pay for the loner cars accounts for about $700 million of the charge we took in the quarter. The balance of the charges for the other recalls we announced in that quarter as well. The overarching objectives for this recall are to repair the cars as quicker as we can win back the full trust and confidence of our customers, our regulators and other stakeholders. That\u2019s why GM's goal is to have the best product safety practices in the industry. In July 2012, we simplified our product development leadership structures to remove side loads and complexity. In January 2013, we launched a comprehensive program to retool our product quality and durability validation process. To accelerate our drive to leadership we organized and restructured our global product development team during the last six weeks. In March, we promoted Jeff Boyer to the new position of Vice President for Global Vehicle Safety and he is leading a stronger more aligned and cohesive global safety organization. Jeff\u2019s job includes oversight of the safety development process for GM\u2019s vehicle system, the confirmation and validation of safety performance and the post sales safety activities such as recalls. His team will also be creating new methods in analytical tools to help us identify safety concerns earlier and assess them more effectively. We also know that a big part of putting the safest vehicles on the road is to ensure we have a culture where every employee knows vehicle safety issues and other ideas forward. This lets us to create the Speak up for Safety program which launches in May. Speak up for Safety we will recognize employee ideas that could make our vehicle safer, we will also recognize them for speaking up when they see something that could impact customer safety. The program will include a global 24/7 hotline and a micro site dedicated to vehicle safety. This will provide a direct conduit to our safety organizations and our problems-tracking system to ensure a closed-loop reporting and review process. This week we also rolled out fundamental changes in the way we develop vehicles. Going forward our global vehicle engineering organization will consist of a global vehicle components and sub-systems team and a global product integrity team. The objective is to improve cross systems integration and deliver more consistent performance across vehicle programs and ensure functional safety and compliance of all our vehicles. As Mark said when announcing the restructuring. A vehicle is a collection of 30,000 individual parts, when we integrated those parts into a cohesive system with industry leading safety and quality is the key to winning in this customer driven business. Finally, we will now require all engineers to have their design for six sigma black belt study in the 2015. I hope you can see that all of these changes and initiatives will help us accelerate the momentum we carried into this year and throughout the quarter. Sure, there have been set back that\u2019s part of our business nevertheless our overall progress has been sure and steady. Our cars, trucks and crossovers are winning awards and new customers around the world. Our product launching is going to make us an even more affordable competitor as we move forward in our largest and most profitable regions are strong. The parts of the business that had weighed down our results are turning around and third parties are recognizing something we have known for a long time. We have got great dealers who deliver exceptional customer service. This is the payout for years of hard work and it shows the resiliency that our company now has. With that I\u2019d like to invite Chuck Stevens to take you through the quarter in a bit more detail. Chuck Stevens : Thanks Mary. Slide six provides the summary of our first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP results. Net revenue for the period was $37.4 billion, up $500 million due primarily to the acquisition of Ally International business while automotive revenue was flat year-over-year. Our operating income decreased to a loss of $500 million primarily due to the $1.3 billion charge associated with product recalls and the Venezuela currency devaluation charge of $400 million. Net income to common stockholders declined $700 million to $100 million and diluted earnings per share came in at $0.06. Automotive net cash from operating activities was $2 billion, $1.5 billion increase from the same period in 2013. For our non-GAAP measures including the impact of the $1.3 billion of recall related charges EBIT adjusted was $500 million in the first quarter and the EBIT adjusted margin was 1.2%. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $200 million for the quarter, a $1.6 billion increase from 2013 primarily due to improved working capital. Slide seven identifies special items for the first quarter that had an impact on our earnings per share. At the top of the slide our net income to common stockholders was $100 million and our diluted earnings per share was $0.06. As we advised in our March sales filing with the SEC we had a $400 million charge associated with the devaluation of the Venezuela and Boulevard in the first quarter of 2014 and a $200 million charge in the prior year\u2019s first quarter? This charge had a $0.23 and $0.09 unfavourable impact on earnings per share in each of the quarters respectively. On slide 8, we remind you of our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide we list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our EBIT adjusted margin was 1.2% which includes the negative impact of the $1.3 billion and the recall related charges and an unfavourable 3.5 percentage point impact on margins. Consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were $1.5 million vehicles in the first quarter, down about 5.5% from the prior period. Our global market share decreased 2/10 of a percentage point to 11.1% for Q1 2014.  On slide nine, we provide an explanation of the $1.3 billion decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted. We are in $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013 compared to EBIT adjusted of $500 million in the first quarter of 2014. Volume was $400 million unfavourable primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in GMIO, GMSA and GMNA. Mix was $300 million unfavourable primarily to country mix in GMIO and product change over in GM North America associated with Q1 launches. Price was $1.8 billion favourable due primarily to the strength of North America. Total cost of $2.1 billion unfavourable due primarily to incremental recall related charges of $1.2 billion, increased material costs associated with new products of approximately $1 billion and $200 million in incremental restructuring cost. Other was $400 million unfavourable primarily due to foreign exchange. Slide 10 gives our year over year EBIT adjusted performance by segment. I would like to highlight that we changed our reporting structure to reclassify the results of our Russian subsidiary previously reported in our GMIO segment to our GME segment. The prior periods have been revised for comparability. GMNA EBIT adjusted was down $900 million to $600 million in the quarter including $1.3 billion in recall charges. GME came in at a $300 million loss including $200 million of incremental restructuring costs. GMIO decreased to $300 million and GMSA recorded a loss of $200 million for the quarter. GM Financial continue to deliver solid profitability with $200 million in earnings before taxes and our corporate sector was a $100 million expanse for the total of 500 million EBIT adjusted in the quarter. We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 11. For the first quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 70%. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis are up marginally compared to the prior year period. On a percentage of ATP basis our incentives for the quarter were 10.9%. This puts us in a 106% of industry average levels for the first quarter of 2014. This is down from 115% of industry average in the prior year period as we manage through the sell down of the prior generation of full-size trucks. Turning to slide 12, we showed GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide revenue in the segment of the business was $24.4 billion, up $1.4 billion from the same quarter in 2013. That\u2019s an increase of over 6% driven by record average transaction prices. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin was 2.3% for the quarter which included the negative impact of 5.4 percentage points associated with recall related charges. Our U.S. dealer inventory was 815,000 units at in the first quarter, or about 83 day supply, which is basically flat on a day supply bases compared to the same period last year. GM North America\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 807,000 units for the quarter, but 22,000 units decrease from the first quarter of 2013 and North American market share came in at 16.5%. On slide 13, we provide explanation of $900 million year-over-year decline in GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted. GM North America as EBIT adjusted was $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2013. Volume was a $100 million unfavorable due to the lower wholesale vehicle sales. Mix was $100 million unfavorable, primarily due to limited availability of some of our full-size SUV\u2019s such as the Escalade as many of the new models launched later in the quarter. Price was $1.7 billion favorable driven by recently launched products such as our full-size trucks Cadillac CTS and Chevrolet Impala. Cost was unfavorable $2.3 billion, primarily due to $1.2 billion in incremental recall related charges, 1 billion in material costs associated primarily with recently launched products, and increased promotional expenses associated with the winter or Olympics. Other was 100 million unfavorable, primarily due to FX. This makes to EBIT adjusted of $600 million. On slide 14, GME reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million for the first quarter, including $200 million of incremental restructuring costs. Revenue was $5.6 billion, up over $300 million and 6.6% due to the success of our recently launched products and improving market conditions as the industry increased 1.5% compared to the prior year. EBIT adjusted margin in segment was a negative 5.1%. Europe\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 291,000 units, up 16,000 units from the first quarter of 2013. Our European market share in the first quarter was 7.3%, a slight decrease from the prior year driven primarily by the wind down of the Chevrolet brands. On Slide 15, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s $100 million year-over-year decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was favorable $100 million driven by sales of the Opel Malta and new Insignia flagship. This impact of mix was flat quarter-over-quarter. Price was unfavorable at $100 million as we continue to see competitive pressure in the European market. Cost was $100 million unfavorable as incremental restructuring cost of $200 million was partially offset by favorable material performance. Other was flat quarter-over-quarter as the unfavorable FX impact of the Russian ruble was mostly offset by the favorable impact of the British pound. This totals to GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of $300 million for the first quarter of 2014. Overall it continues to improve when all things considered. We now move onto GMIO\u2019s profitability for the prior type orders on slide 16. In the first quarter of 2014, EBIT-adjusted was $300 million including equity income from our joint ventures. This was down $200 million as weakness in consolidated operations, more than offset the strong performance of our China joint ventures. At the bottom of the slide GMIO\u2019s revenue from our consolidated operations was $3.2 billion. This was a $1.1 billion decline from Q1 2013, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes and approximately $200 million in unfavourable foreign exchange primarily associated with the Australian dollar and South African rand. GMIO\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 8.8%, down 6.9 percentage points from the prior year. This was primarily due to unfavourable mix in the Middle East related to product launch timings. Our net income margin for our China joint ventures was 11.2%, down 0.5 percentage point from the prior year. GMIO\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 162,000 units for its consolidated operations and 934,000 units for our China joint ventures where the number of deliveries in the quarter reached a new record. Our market share in the region was 10%, 0.2 percentage point increase from last year. Or market share in China remained a very strong 15.2% for the first quarter, up 1/10th of a percentage point from the prior year period. Turning to slide 17, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s year over year performance Volume is $200 million unfavourable, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in the Middle East, India and Thailand. Mix was $200 million unfavourable, primarily due to lower sales of full-size trucks and as you reach in the Middle East, due primarily to launch timing. Price was flat compared to the prior period. Cost was favourable, $300 million primarily related to reduced manufacturing, lower depreciation expenses, in savings related to the wind down of the Chevrolet brand from Europe. Other was $100 million unfavourable primarily due to Korean non-controlling interest and FX.  On slide 18, we look at GM South America, EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $3 billion in the first quarter, a 700 million decrease in 2013. This was due primarily to unfavourable foreign exchange associated with the weakening of local currencies in Brazil and Argentina and reduced volume in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. The EBIT adjusted margin in the segment was a negative 5.2%, unfavourably impacted by instability in Venezuela and restructuring in Brazil. GM South Americas wholesale vehicle sales were 208,000 units, 25,000 less than the first quarter of 2013. South America market share was 16.3% in the quarter, 0.9 percentage point decline from the prior year, primarily due to Argentina and lower production in Venezuela. On Slide 19, we look at the components of a $100 million decline in profitability in our South American segment. And that impact the volume was unfavourable 100 million due primarily to reduce wholesale vehicle sales in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, mix was flat. Price was 200 million favourable we took action in Argentina and Brazil to partially offset foreign exchange into those markets. Cost was flat compared to the prior year period. Auto was 300 million unfavourable primarily due to unfavourable foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina, these totals to $200 million loss for GM South America in the first quarter.  Slide 20 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the first quarter. After adjusting for non-controlling interest, preferred dividend on Series A and deducting GM financial, our automotive income was $100 million for the quarter. We had 400 million in non-cash special items and our depreciations and amortization expense was $1.4 billion expense. Working capital was a $400 million source of cash. The $1.3 billion increased in this category is primarily related to one less payment cycle and increased vehicle production in the quarter. Auto was 100 million uses of cash, and that 700 million improvement from the prior year, in primarily to the incremental recall accruals these totals down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of 2 billion. We have 1.8 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter for a total adjusted automotive free cash flow of 200 million. On Slide 21, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the quarter with $27 billion in cash and current marketable securities and $10.4 billion in available credit facilities for a total available liquidity of $37.4 billion. Our book value of that was $7.2 billion and the book value of our Series A preferred stock remained at $3.1 billion. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans are under funded by $7.2 billion and our non-U.S. pensions are under funded by $12.2 billion. Our unfunded overhead liability decreased to $6.2 billion in the first quarter.  Slide 22 provides a summary of our auto financing activities. GM financial reported the results this morning and we will be holding and earnings conference call at 12 :00 o\u2019clock. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the first quarter came in at 7.9% modestly increase from the prior year period and slightly above industry penetration. Our U.S. fleet penetration increased 3.2 percentage points to 24.2% in Q1 as we took advantage of higher residual value on our recently launched new products to begin closing the gap to competitive leasing levels. This penetration in Canada was at 23.4% up 13.3 percentage points from the prior year, as we move to a level of more aligned with industry averages. GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM financial originations closed at 70% and GM financial percentage of GM U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 21% in the quarter. GM financials annualized net credit losses remain low and improved to 1.8% and the earnings before tax adjusted were $221 million for the first quarter, up $41 million from the prior period.  Turning to Slide 23, although our overall results were overshadowed by the impact of recall charges, we have very strong financial results this quarter, setting aside the recall related charges with total company core operating performance is on plan for the year. GM North America is on plan in early results indicate that our recently launched products have been well received in the market. We continue to expect light vehicle start to be in the 16 million to 15.5 million unit ranges. Consolidated international operations are on plan as we continue to work through the expected challenges of managing the launches of our full size trucks and SUVs in Middle East, as well as the restructuring efforts in the region. Europe is performing ahead of plan as the industry continues to improve in the success of our recently launched products continue to deliver results. Product such as the Mokka and the redesigned Insignia led by Opel and Vauxhall brands to their highest market in several years this past March. China is also performing ahead of plan, where we continue to set sales records. GM South America is considerably weaker, as the environment Venezuela and other markets continue to be challenging. Additional challenges that we\u2019ll need to manage include our known market impact in the U.S. to do the recall actions, foreign exchange headwinds in Russia and South America and political end market volatility in several emerging markets. Needless to say we have much work to do; the Q1 was strong all things considered. Now Mary and I will take your questions after which we will have some closing remarks. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now conduct the analyst question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank :  Okay. Well, I have a couple things that I will throw out there. One is, North America; can you talk about that $1 billion of content cost increase in the quarter? Should we be netting that against the $1.7 billion of price to basically conclude that 35% of that pricing is dropping to the bottom line? Do you need to have that level of pricing going forward? Or do you expect to have $1 billion a quarter of content growth? And then secondly, at one point, Chuck, you had indicated that you were expecting a net cost reduction of around $1 billion in North America in 2015 versus 2014; and there were a few components of that : fixed costs, and logistics, and purchasing. Is that still the case? Or are some of the changes that are being made to product development or warranty accruals going to have an effect on some of those cost-savings expectations? Chuck Stevens :  Let me take your first question or the first part of your question first Rod. As we\u2019ve talked about before a lot of the net pricing on new products and remember net pricing that we show is the impact in the current quarter for those products that have been launched in the last 12 months. So you\u2019re right the $1 billion of material cost related to content really needs to be netted against the 1.7 billion or so or net price associated with the newly launched products are resulting in kind of a net roll through to the bottom line of 700 million. I think we\u2019ve talked about this before. We would expect to see in the first half of the year pretty significant year-over-year improvement and pricing driven by launch products and then we see it tail off in the second half of the year because we\u2019ll be through the full 12 month launch cycle of the full size pickups. At the same time you\u2019ll see on a year-over-year basis the material cost associated with content drop off as well. So that\u2019s how to think about that. On the cost reduction billion dollars I don\u2019t recall saying that was all in 2014, I think I indicated that in our glide path going forward to 10% EBIT margins that we expected to pick up about 100 basis points of cost between \u201914 and \u201915 driven to a large extent by material and logistic savings primarily material cost optimization, with fixed costs over that timeframe in the next couple of years being relatively flat the efficiencies and non-marketing related SG&A like global business services, IT and some manufacturing efficiencies offsetting headwinds and incremental marketing in D&A. And I would say that plan still holds and that\u2019s what we\u2019re executing too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brian Johnson - Barclays:  A couple of questions and I think the two are related. The first represents, is around kind of the price versus costs trade off you are making, or you made first quarter in pick-up trucks and the second has been overall cadence to GMNA and overall. So the first question your share in pick-up trucks represent 4% to this 35% first quarter. But it looks like you had very good price even net of contract cost. Is that the kind of trade off you\u2019re going to be looking to make going forward through the year? Or do you see stepping up on the volume and down a bit on the price as we go into the spring selling season. Chuck Stevens : I would say first and foremost we\u2019re going to continue to demonstrate incentive and pricing discipline and I think we\u2019ve seen that through the launch of the full size pick-ups thus far and it\u2019s rolled through our results. At the same time we\u2019re going to be competitive when we talked about the February 6, call that we had the need to address some of the competitive challenges at the lower end of the market, especially Silverado. If you actually look at share year-over-year Sierra is up year-over-year Silverado was down and that\u2019s primarily at the low end of the market. We\u2019ve taken action in March and April to address that so far based on early 10 reads we\u2019ve picked up about 160 to 170 basis points a share, on a retail basis full size pick-ups, so we\u2019re starting to get traction. But we need to do that Brian in a very balanced way, we do not want to give up the gains that we\u2019ve made on mix moving our crew cab mix up and the higher contended premium vehicles that we\u2019re selling. And we think we can accomplish both if we\u2019re smart about our go to market execution. Relative to earnings cadence I think it\u2019s fair to say back in February and January for that matter we indicated that Q1 was going to be in the range of 10% to 15% I think it\u2019s safe to say we performed better than the 15% as a percentage of our total earnings for the year. Broad based across the board improvement versus our expectations across all of the regions fundamentally cost driven so I think we\u2019re going to see the rest of the year for both North America and the Corp is more normalized Q2 through Q4 earnings. Brian Johnson - Barclays: So does that imply that there is a step down off of the seasonality? That is, those are going to be seasonally weaker, hence you are maintaining your overall guide? Or you are going to see how the year goes and there might be room to move up? Chuck Stevens : Yes I would say that we have not changed our view for the year which was overall excluding the impact of recalls we expected earnings to be up in aggregate relatively flat margins what I\u2019d say is we changed the shape of the curve. We performed better than we expected in the first quarter so we\u2019ll have to trim some of the expectation to Q2 through Q4. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First question is a two-part question. First, on the recall, 7 million units obviously creates an enormous amount of showroom traffic and an opportunity to convert that traffic into new sales. So could you outline, perhaps, how successful have you been so far in getting folks coming in and holding the hand and obviously helping them with a real issue, but also perhaps helping to convert a sale in the process? The second is, following the expiry of the NOL rights program under Section 382, could you confirm whether General Motors has any more poison-pill type of mechanisms in place that could be used as defense in case of any stake pulling? Or is there no such thing at this point? Thank you. Mary Barra : Adam I think the first question as it relates to the 7 million unit recall and actually it\u2019s 6 million actual vehicles but when we and when you look at the total amount of issues that were recalled we do see that as a huge opportunity it\u2019s a little too early we\u2019re in the early days it\u2019s just a couple of weeks ago that we started having part kits coming so we can do repairs. Our dealers are well positioned to do that we\u2019ve had excellent dealer communications and actually really reworked our processes to be very responsive to the customer in that we\u2019re shipping part kits by then to dealers to make sure that we get to the customers so we don\u2019t have one dealer that have excess cars and another that\u2019s waiting for cars we\u2019ve also put the tools in the hands of the dealer that they can offer employee pricing to that individual or someone in the household. And I\u2019d say anecdotally right now we\u2019re getting feedback from customers that in fact there is supposed to one last night that had their vehicle repaired and from the note to me send our loyal GM customer so again your point is well taken it\u2019s going to how well we manage it I think it\u2019s just our dealers have been externally recognized for the type of customer or services that is actually that they\u2019re providing they\u2019re geared up to do this and I am confident that they\u2019re going to be demonstrating our focus on the customer as we go through this and it will have positive results. Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley : Thanks Mary. Chuck Stevens : And Adam on the second part of your question we don\u2019t have poise until. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So maybe shifting over to Europe, it looks like, excluding restructuring, GM Europe was pretty close to breakeven. I know Russia is now included in there. So first can you quantify the Russian impact? And could GM Europe actually be profitable excluding Russia? And if so, what does that mean in terms of the outlook for breakeven in GM Europe, perhaps outside of Russia, for the next couple of years? Chuck Stevens : First, we haven\u2019t changed our guidance on breakeven in Europe including or excluding Russia it\u2019s mid-decade. Second, I am not going to provide country level profitability Itay the regional results in Europe we lost excluding the impact of recalls we lost 100 million which is a 100 million improvement versus the first quarter last year. I would say that certainly a good sign. We\u2019re starting to get traction. The industry has performed better than we expected and we\u2019re performing better than we expected. And I indicated in the other considerations section of the debt that we expect Europe to perform better than planned for the year and I think we\u2019re seeing some of that in Q1 but from an overall perspective mid-decade breakeven is still our objective. Mary Barra : Yes, in fact I\u2019ll just add to that I mean I think if you really look at the stress in Europe is really product driven and I think Karl-Thomas Neumann has done a good job of shifting the conversations and some of the issues at over to the product to me a really important single is the strength of the Insignia which is the flagship and that\u2019s been very well received. So I think that is a very strong signal but it\u2019s a product driven recovery and the shift in the method you have there is to the product. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup : Absolutely. And a quick clarification on North America, if I may. Is target still to gain market share for the full year? I think that was the target you laid out in January. Is that still part of the pricing plans and how you go to market for the rest of the year? Chuck Stevens : That is still one of our objectives for the year to grow market share year-over-year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just a question for both of you, two aspects on the recall. Mary, I just wonder if you could comment on what impact you think your recall and maybe the recalls throughout the industry might have on product development costs and speed, basically the cadence of product intros. Then Chuck, it looks like there is not a lot of this that was added back, so it looks like a lot of the cash was spent in the first quarter. Just trying to understand the timing of the cash conversion of the accrual of the $1.3 billion for the recalls during the course of the year. Mary Barra :  If I understand your question correctly is the product development, I think if you look at the announcement that was made on -- I see the organization acting more efficiently. When you look at the way the Jeff Boyer organization and the global vehicle safety and then the product integrity team is going to pull it together. We have had the chef engineers very involved as we\u2019ve looked at this structuring change that Mark just announced recently with the product integrity team and the team devoted to the components and sub-systems. So I think it will -- I don\u2019t see it changing the engineering cost to develop new vehicles. And then when you look at these safety organization and our ability, people are putting in place in the way we\u2019re going to work across the organization and I think it\u2019s going to allow us to increase our speed once we understand an issue. And ultimately if you discover an issue and you first discover most likely and then cause it more quickly, overall that\u2019s going to be a lower impact as well. So I don\u2019t see an increase related if in understood your question correctly. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, that's it. Then, Chuck, just on the timing of that cash payment? Chuck Stevens : The Q1 cash flow did not include a significant level of cash costs associated with the recall of the pretty minimal primarily related to any payments that we made on currency transportation and or loner. The fundamental cash associated with the recall will start to fall current vehicle sale. If I look at the cadence it\u2019s going to be weighted Q2 to Q4 pretty evenly for the rest of the year that\u2019s when the cash costs are going to roll through the results. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and then just one follow-up question on North America. On slide 13, mix was a slight negative. Obviously, we had the HD and the large SUVs launch. When do we actually start to see the benefit from those flowing through on mix? I would imagine we'd have seen some of that in the first quarter. But is the bulk coming in the second quarter? Chuck Stevens : I would think that we\u2019re going to see improved mix on a go forward basis, Q2 forward but a lot of the improvement associated with the full size utilities and HD will fall into price in Q2 on a year-over-year basis and we\u2019ll start to see favourable mix again on a year-over-year basis in Q2 being driven by full sized pick-ups that were launched last year in the later part of Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions. Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan :  Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I believe that a member of the Canadian General Investment Corporation recently discussed potentially divesting their GM stake this year. So I know you said before that you don't intend to approach either Canada or the UAW relative to their stakes; but that if they came to you, you would be a good listener, like in the case of the U.S. Treasury. So I am curious if you can say whether they have approached you. And then if you can't, maybe just more generally, what are your feelings about whether you think there is currently a buying opportunity in GM's stock for either the Corporation or for investors? Chuck Stevens : The Canadians have not approached us yet; we read probably the same press release that you did. I think the best way to answer that question Ryan is we\u2019ve demonstrated the willingness to be opportunistic in past and we\u2019ll have to see how this develops with the Canadian share sales. I think your second question was around, do we think from a General Motors perspective it\u2019s appropriate to go into potentially the open market buyback stock. And I think there is a number of other issues that we need to deal with right now before we think about that, and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan : Okay, then. Great. And then just on China, very strong margin there, 11.2%. I had thought over the last couple calls that we'd discussed that you were experiencing some headwinds there relative to new facility expansion expense; the investments that you are making to drive Cadillac sales could pressure margin near term but help medium term. Should we think about that differently now? Have you cycled past that? Chuck Stevens : Well I think what we said for China for the years we expected margins to be similar to 2013 levels, somewhere in call it the 9% to 10% range. Q4 the margins were 7.6% and that was driven by some start up related expenses and we\u2019ve kind of cycled past that. Generally Q1 is a richer margin quarter, if you think about the cadence but I think we\u2019re still feeling pretty good about margins in the range of 9% to 10% or relatively flat year-over-year in China. Ryan Brinkman - JP Morgan : Okay, great. Thanks. Just last question, follow-up to that. I know that your consolidated I/O EBIT walk doesn't really breakout the drivers within China, but sort of lumps equity income together. Can you maybe talk about how those pieces are moving over there? How is price changing year over year-end for the full year? Or however you would like to break out price and mix and costs, etc., just high level. Thanks. Chuck Stevens : Yeah. High level volume is favourable, mix is favourable as we start to saw more Cadillac and SUVs price is a headwind, the net pricing dynamic in China the holistic is generally been around 3% per year, negative 3% per year, so we expect that to be. Headwind material costs will be a tailwind and fix cost will a headwind as we continue to expand our manufacturing footprint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Yes, a couple. Just on the charges, housekeeping. It sounded like what you took, the $1.3 billion applied to 6 million vehicles in total. As I understand that this is something that is evolving, but as far as you can tell with all the issues and costs that are visible now, is this largely behind us as a one timer in the first quarter or you know would you expect if you know subsequent catch up charge in following quarters? Mary Barra : You know as well look at the whole process, what we\u2019ve got is, is we really redoubled our effort to make sure if there were issues that had been lingering, that we got in, we understood it. We put more people in that organizations to make sure we quickly get to issue. I can\u2019t predict the future to say, what will happen as we go forward, but what I can say is, we will respond to big or small issues as quickly as we can. And in doing that with the speed of responding, allows us to I think really minimize the impact as you get to a smaller population. So that what we\u2019re going to do going forward and we\u2019re going to remain focused on the customer as we look at this issues. Chuck Stevens : And Patrick, relative to your question. The 1.3 billion that we took in Q1 covers what we think is going to be the overall cost to repair and courtesy transportation for the recalls that we announced in the first quarter. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Okay. No, that's helpful. And just on South America, maybe we can spend a little bit of time there. Obviously, it is very little visibility on the macro front. But are you -- I know you have been restructuring Brazil; but are you considering maybe more assertive actions? Like potentially rethinking the Venezuela manufacturing footprint, even if you are not rethinking sales in Venezuela, or stepping up the level of restructuring activity in the region. Because it does sound like -- and then maybe if you have a sense of what -- your expectation, even if it is something with wide parameters around it, what your expectation for that market might be that you are rolling with. That would be helpful. Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Let me start, kind of, 10,000 feet I am working my down a little bit. At the end of 2011, early 2012 we embarked on, kind of, a four pronged approach specific to Brazil, but also cuts the rest of the region and how to take and continue to drive improvement in the region product. But the real launch on, our real focus on product launches and I would say that the most recently launched products are doing extremely in Brazil and in the rest of the region. They now account for about 75% of our volume. So we\u2019re very pleased with how we\u2019ve approached that. Second was to really work on our fixed cost and we continue and will continue to make progress and take actions from a fix cost perspective both SG&A and manufacturing. In the Q1 results we had a roughly $50 million charge for continuing restructure we closed, finished up the closure of the San Jose passenger facility. We just got an agreement with Gravatai and our three-year labour deal with 0% real economic associated with it. So we continue to work through that. The third piece was really to work through our material cost, localization and logistics and we continue to work through that. I would say, it\u2019s unfortunate we\u2019ve made significant progress in Brazil and other markets over the past couple of years. But the economic environment has moved, just as rapidly as we\u2019ve been making changes or make an improvement, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. We\u2019re very strong in Brazil we have a great deal in network. We\u2019ve got a great portfolio now a very a strong brand and that\u2019s the place that we\u2019re going to focus on to win. Relative to Venezuela, we like Venezuela when it\u2019s running normally; it hasn\u2019t run normally for the last three quarters. Clearly, that\u2019s weighing down our results. We see no resolution in the near term we continue to work very, very closely through the Brazilian government and also directly with the Venezuelan government to try to determine when the things will return to some level or normalcy, there so we can build and sell vehicle. It can be a very constructive market. So we are weighing our options very, very carefully there. If there\u2019s an opportunity going forward for some normal business we certainly don\u2019t want to pull out and go back in, we\u2019ve shown before when we do that, typically it\u2019s not a good outcome, but we need to discontinue to monitor that. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : That's helpful. And just on the market, one of the suppliers that reported earlier had a 10% down light-vehicle estimate for the region, which struck me as pretty severe. Any kind of ranges as to what you guys are thinking about in your base plan now? Chuck Stevens : Yes, as I indicated on the other considerations chart we expect South America to be weaker than expected so if we go back to January our view at that time three months ago was that South America should be improved year over year that\u2019s not going to happen we\u2019re not going to have improvement year over year in South American we seeing a resolution in the near term to Venezuela and I would say I don\u2019t necessarily agree with the 10% industry down take but I would say the industry is softer than we expected in Argentina and Brazil. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Colin Langan - UBS : Great. Thanks for taking my question. You commented earlier that you are still targeting higher market share in North America, and that April was coming in strong. Are you not anticipating any market share loss following the recall? How are you thinking about the near-term market share impact with all the negative headlines? Mary Barra : Well, as we look the trades of the product portfolio that we have that\u2019s coming out we\u2019re just on the really in the middle and so bringing out the full size trucks the heavy duty trucks the SUVs we have more launch products coming and we see strength both from the reception and then also from external assessment of those vehicles and we haven\u2019t seen anything meaningful to-date and we plan on continuing to serve these customers well as they come in and that coupled with our products we\u2019re going to focus on that to minimize if any impact occurs but right now we haven\u2019t seen anything meaningful. Colin Langan - UBS : Okay. And any colour on a potential civil settlement, at least maybe in terms of the timing you might announce something have been probably [indiscernible]? Mary Barra : As I said we expect to have recommendation from tenant in 45 days or so, so I don\u2019t have anything more to comment as you imagine it\u2019s a complex situation as we evaluate both the legal and civic aspects of this but we are working with him and as soon as we have something to share we\u2019ll get it out. Colin Langan - UBS : Okay. And then just thinking about restructuring, what is -- is the $1.1 billion that you initially guided to, is that still the right number? How should we think about that, how it plays out through the year? Chuck Stevens : Yes, the 1.1 billion is still the right number and as we indicated the majority of that is really related to the planned closure of the our facility in Bochum with the balance been spread and the other regions outside of North America we indicated that the weighting would be more front end loaded we had all in about 300 million of restructuring in Q1 so I would expect that to as we move through the of the year to start to come down a bit but still in that 1.1 billion range. Colin Langan - UBS : Any actions in GMIO? Because obviously the consolidated operations remain a bit weak and you did have the exit of Chevy. Is there any plans in place there? And when should we expect a restructuring in that region? Chuck Stevens : Yes, okay, first obviously a big one is the wind down of Chevy Europe we also announced the succession of manufacturing operations in Australia and we\u2019re working through that as we speak that has a bit of tail on but as we\u2019re going to continue to wide that down over the next two or three years Stefan Jacoby and his team have went country by country and started to work through some of the issues that we have and the way I think about consolidated operations outside what I just talked about the Chevy wind down in Australia is we\u2019ve got to get the portfolio right. We recognize that we\u2019ve got portfolio weakness in Southeast Asia and in India, in South Africa and some of these other markets that we need to deal with. So that\u2019s first and foremost that starts and ends with great products. And then we need to put in place the right business model around that which means manufacturing footprint dealer network the right level of localization, the right commercialization or industrialization of that portfolio and that\u2019s all work in process. I would expect to see as we move from Q1 to the rest of the year some improvement primarily driven by improved results in the Middle East the rest of the improvement in the consolidated operations that\u2019s going to fall into 2015 and 2016 this is going to be a multi quarter journey. Mary Barra : I would just add though and I just went through with Stefan of this countries yesterday and if you look at it in addition to everything that Chuck talked about we\u2019ve got the right people. I think you all know this is a detailed business that trucks that you got to have the right product, you got to have the right understanding of the marketplace and go into market every single day. I feel very confident with several country leaders that we now in place under Stefan\u2019s leadership we\u2019re just going to keep and get us in it\u2019s a multi quarter journey but they\u2019re definitely on the journey and they\u2019re looking at it the right way. So I think you\u2019ll see positive momentum there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. This will be our last question. Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks so much. One quick one. While I wouldn't expect it to be large, are there any costs associated with dealing with the suppliers related to the recall? Chuck Stevens : What do you mean costs associated, related to the suppliers? Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets : I mean, I guess, how are you handling that transaction with the suppliers? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. What we\u2019re doing is doing everything that we can do to ensure that we\u2019re getting parts produced, the right parts produced as quickly as possible so we can take care of our customers. So we are paying and funding, one needs to get done in order to make sure that we\u2019re getting supply. Mary Barra : And I would say we take tremendous cooperation with the suppliers, you know working right under the senior leadership of the company. Great participation and they are completely supporting our goal to get parts as quickly as we can to get this vehicles repaired it as quickly as we can. So it\u2019s been working quite well. Chuck Stevens : And just, the technical point the cost associated with that part that\u2019s in the 1.3 billion. Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Perfect. And then just as we think about some of the other regions, and I harken back to your comment and North America with the pricing, but then offset for some of the content thing. And you have talked about how improvement in other regions of the world needs to be product-driven as well. So -- and I realize each of these markets are different, so I don't know if you want to go market by market or maybe we specifically could focus on Europe, which I think is the closest to a turnaround. Should we also expect that sort of relationship, where you are able to get a little bit of price, but then you have to pay for it a little bit on the content side? Or is it such -- is that market such that you are not actually going to be able to fully price for the content to be competitive? Chuck Stevens : What I think that\u2019s the question that you need to answer on a specific product level for instance, as an example. The next generation Insignia, depending the content technology that we applied to that vehicle has, the ability to recover more price than the next generation courses, so we have to be very smart about how we apply content? How we industrialize it? How we make sure that we\u2019re getting cost of product, those possible cost because not every segment can afford the kind of pricing improvements that we see on full size pick up or full size SUVs or CTS vehicle like that. Mary Barra : I would just add to that, I think it\u2019s getting the right content on the vehicle for the segment and that\u2019s -- there has been a tremendous amount of work done so you have a much better revise segment by market. What is the pre-content that is going to be valued by the customer and therefore they\u2019re willing to pay. And then to look at that there, specially as we look at some of the products that are going to continue to be launched over the near term, a lot I would say better work done to leverage our global scale in the material cost aspect of those product. So it\u2019s a balance between the two, but it\u2019s the right context and then really leveraging our scale on a way we hadn\u2019t done in the past. Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then Chuck, just one point of clarification. When you say Europe is tracking ahead of plan, is that sort of core Europe or Europe as we used to think of it? Or is that net of Russia which is now inclusive and you have indicated that could be potentially a headwind? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Just to be clear, that\u2019s Europe which includes Russia, we\u2019ve restated our prior results and ahead of plan is versus what we talked about back in January from a Europe perspective, so that\u2019s versus our plan, mid decade breakeven. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Please continue with your presentation of closing remarks. Mary Barra : Thank you very much. Well, first of all I really appreciate everybody\u2019s question today and I\u2019d like to close this call with a simple message that, I think really encapsulate everything that we covered today and everything we\u2019re doing as we moved forward. If you look at General Motors, as we move half the bankruptcy we have really been a company that had demonstrated being proactive at every turn, and we continue to do that. And I will tell you I have, I have been in many global employee forums and talking to employees you know if they email and other mechanism, there is definitely the culture and I see this as an opportunity, even accelerate our culture change to make sure that we are fast to responding and truly integrated organization really dedicated to having great products. We will continue to save down every issue we have both internal and external and also more aggressively pursue the opportunity, because the sales is in the market place, there\u2019s opportunity to market place. And we\u2019re going to continue to minimize the challenges and really go after opportunity to think in a way we have and almost done. So I hope today's discussion gives you more confidence in our customer focused strategy we are leaving it. And it\u2019s easy to say and put it on the piece of paper as you go through difficult time you have to prove and we are demonstrating that every single day. Our 20, I hope you also have confidence in our 2014 outlook and our long term potential. So thanks for your time and I turn it back to Randy. Randy Arickx : Thank Mary. Thanks everybody for your time today we appreciated very much. Thank operator. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect you lines.",

During this presentation, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session for analysts only. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, July 24, 2014. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the first quarter of 2014. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations Web site. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive VP and CFO. After the presentation portion of the call, we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Randy and thanks to everybody for joining this call. On our last earnings call in April, I spoke about GM's resiliency during a very challenging first quarter. As you all know, the ignition switch recall and difficult market conditions in some parts of the world put tremendous pressure on our bottom-line. Nevertheless, we remained profitable. Just as important, we also continued our steady investment in new products and we returned more than 480 million in capital to common shareholders, stockholders through our first quarter dividend. Years of hard work to improve our vehicles, our operations and the customer experience made this possible. As expected the same issues continued into the second quarter, but once again we had strong operating performance and we earned a profit on both in EBIT adjusted and a net income basis and we stayed on our plan. I\u2019ll speak to all these points starting on Slide 2, which presents a summary of our second quarter results. Then I\u2019ll review the highlights that speak to the heart of our business, which is to build great products, satisfy its customers and do it very profitably. At the top of Slide 2, you can see that we delivered 2.5 million units in the quarter. As we announced last week, this was our highest second quarter volume since 2005. Sales in North America and China, the two largest and most profitable markets in the world were up 6% and 8% respectively. However, this was offset to a large degree by declines in markets like Russia and Venezuela, where the industry is weak as well as the strategic decision we made to wind down Chevrolet Europe, this also had an impact on market share. Our global market share in the quarter was down three tenths of a point. However, market share in the United States was equal to a year ago. On a revenue basis, we improved our results by more than 570 million, based on large measure to improvements at GM Financial. Turning to the bottom-line, net income to income to common stockholders was 200 million or $0.11 per share. Combined the recall-related charges and special items we sited in our press release reduced net income by $0.91 per share in the quarter. Absent these items net income would have been about 1.7 billion in the quarter. Looking at net cash, net cash from our automotive operations activities was 3.6 billion and the year-over-year decline reflects recall activity as well changes in working capital due to timing. And what\u2019s not on shown on the slide, our automotive available liquidity improved by 4 billion from a year ago. Finally on an EBIT adjusted basis, GM earned 1.4 billion and our adjusted automotive free cash flow was 1.9 billion. Absent recall and restructuring expenses, EBIT adjusted in the quarter would have been improved slightly from a year ago. For the first half of the year, adjusted automotive free cash flow was nearly 1 billion better than a year ago. Chuck Stevens will break all this down for you in just a few minutes. Let\u2019s look at Slide 3 which presents several highlights from the quarter starting with GM North America, where our core operating performance was exceptionally strong. In fact our EBIT adjusted margins excluding recalls climbed above 9%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin growth excluding recall. In China, we reported record sales and our margins improved by six tenths of a point from a year ago. In Europe, the wind down of Chevrolet Europe is ahead of schedule and costs are below expectations. Meanwhile the recovery of the Opel/Vauxhall brand continued. Opel/Vauxhall sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4% in the first half. Our share was up in 11 European markets in the first half including Germany, which here rose three tenths of a point to 7%. In June alone, our share in Germany reached 7.6% which is almost up a full point versus a year ago. New products have made a big difference. For example, the Mokka was the best selling SUV in the first six months of the year in Germany. All of this keeps us on-track to be profitable mid-decade. We are also targeting European market share of 8% and EBIT adjusted margins in the 5% range by 2022. GM South America meanwhile continues to be very challenging with volumes under pressure across the region. But our core underlying performance in the region is improving. Finally GM Financial continues to execute its growth strategy in order to support increased GM vehicle sales. For example the acquisition of Ally Financial European and Latin American businesses in 2013 as well as GMF\u2019s growth in the North America lease market helped increase their share of GM financing activity from 13% to 20% compared to a year ago. This trend should continue as GMF expands their prime retail loan program in the United States starting in the second half. The next step for GMF is to complete the acquisition of Ally\u2019s joint venture in China, which we expect to close subject to certain regulatory and other approvals late 2014 or as soon as possible thereafter. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 4, which discusses our recall activity in the quarter. Let me begin by stating that my total focus is to make GM the best automotive company for our customers as it relates to the safety, quality, reliability and overall value. We are not going to be satisfied by simply solving our current problems. We are completely aimed at being industry leaders. By now, all of you are familiar with the findings of the Valukas\u2019 report which was presented to our Board of Directors in June and then shared with NHTSA and other government agencies. I have fully embraced the report and pledge to act on all of the recommendations. Importantly a great many were acted on before the report was even released. Actions that we have taken include elevating safety decision making to the highest levels of the company. Creating a new position, the Vice President of Global Safety, that\u2019s Jeff Boyer and he has full access to me and has regular reporting out to our senior leadership team as well as the Board. We also reorganized vehicle engineering and created the new product integrity organization which I am confident will improve quality safety and the functional performance of our vehicles through a better design, execution and systems integration. We also removed 15 employees from the Company, some for misconduct or incompetence, others because they simply don\u2019t take responsibility or act with a sense of urgency. We instituted a Speak Up for Safety program to encourage and recognize employees when they report potential safety issues and do it quickly. We have already received more than 280 suggestions. And we\u2019ve now added 60 safety investigators to identify and address issues much more quickly and we\u2019ve aligned the legal staff to help assure transparency and information sharing among the staffs and other business units across the entire company. Overall, we are dramatically enhancing our approach to safety. You can see it in the aggressive stance we are taking on recalls and the redoubling of our efforts. This year we have looked at vehicles going back to the 1990s and the results were 60 individual recalls in United States covering 29 million vehicles in North America. About two-thirds of the recalled vehicles are no longer in production and more than 12 million of the vehicles will be fixed by simply replacing or modifying the key. In addition, some of the recalls were quite small. We had 13 recalls of less than a 1,000 vehicles and 5 with less than a 100. The financial impact of this activity in the second quarter is outlined on the slide. A recall related charge of 1.2 billion in this quarter. This work is now substantially complete and I believe we have now addressed the major outstanding issues. But if we see new data we will address it. Today we are bringing greater rigor, discipline and urgency to our analysis and decision making process with regard to safety and our recall. We are mining every source of data available to us from the factory floor to warranty information to customer calls to social media to legal claims, all sources of information. And we\u2019re not waiting to see if the trend develops. We want our customers to know that if we identify an issue that could possibly affect their safety we will act quickly. With respect to the ignition switch recall itself, as I have said before, we are taking responsibility for what happened and we are treating the people who suffered physical injury or loss of loved one with compassion, decency and fairness. As you know the compensation program that independent program administrator Ken Feinberg has developed will begin accepting claims on August 1st. The creation of the program has resulted in a 400 million pretax special item in this quarter as you can see on the slide. Also, vehicle repairs are well underway. More than 550,000 vehicles have been repaired and we are on-track to have enough kits to repair the majority of the recalled vehicles by early October. As parts availability has improved and the pace of repairs has accelerated, we have seen a corresponding decline in the demand for rental cars. This was expected. Okay. Let\u2019s turn back to earnings and I\u2019ll now ask Chuck to walk you through a detailed review of the quarter. And then Chuck and I will take your questions. Chuck? Chuck Stevens : Thanks Mary. On Slide 5 we again remind you of the results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was 39.6 billion. So nearly 600 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to favorable mix of 1.2 billion, favorable price of 1.1 billion, increased revenue from GM Financial of 400 million, partially offset by a negative 1.8 billion associated with lower wholesale volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange of 400 million primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar. Our operating income was a loss of 500 million primarily attributable to 1.2 billion in recall-related expenses, and 1.3 billion in special charges which I will cover in more detail later. Net income to common stockholders declined 1 billion to 200 million and our diluted earnings per share came in at $0.11, again, influenced by recall-related expense and special charges. As Mary indicated, net income was 1.7 billion excluding recalls and special charges. Automotive net cash from operating activities was 3.6 billion, a 900 million decrease from the same period in 2013. For our non-GAAP measures EBIT adjusted was 1.4 billion in the second quarter including 1.2 billion of recall-related expenses and $200 million of restructuring. And EBIT adjusted margin was 3.4%, down from a year ago again adversely impacted by a negative 2.9% due to recalls. Adjusted automotive free cash flow decreased 600 million to 1.9 billion for the second quarter. However, this is nearly 1 billion higher for the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2013 including $300 million of recall-related cash costs. On Slide 6, we disclosed the special items that impacted earnings per share. Net income to common stockholders was 200 million and our diluted earnings per share were $0.11. Included in our special items for the quarter is a 900 million non-cash pre-tax charge relating to a change in how we estimate costs for recall campaigns in GM North America. This reduced net income by approximately 500 million in the quarter and I\u2019ll go into more detail regarding this change in the next chart. Additionally, as previously announced GM will implement a compensation program for those who have lost loved ones or suffered from physical injuries as the result of the -- an ignition switch failure related to the 2.6 million vehicles recalled earlier this year. A special charge of $400 million pre-tax was taken for the GM ignition switch compensation program, which reduced net income by $200 million on an after-tax basis. There is no cap on this program but this charge is to the Company\u2019s best estimate of the amounts that maybe paid to claims. Due to the unique nature of the program, this estimate contains significant uncertainty and it is possible that total cost could increase by approximately $200 million. The impact of these special items had a $0.47 unfavorable impact onto diluted earnings per share in the period. On Slide 7, we give you an update on our GMNA recall expense. We have substantially completed our efforts to address outstanding recall issues and also enhanced the analytical data available which contributed to better overall estimating capabilities. In addition, we have made several significant organizational changes such as the creation of a new global product integrity organization and the appointment of a new Global Vice President of Vehicle Safety responsible for the safety development of our vehicle systems as Mary mentioned earlier. As a result, beginning in Q3, GMNA will accrue estimated recall expense at the time of vehicle sale which will be a similar method with how we currently accrue for policy and warranty and will be in line with other manufacturers. Going forward, we expect future recall expense to normalize at levels higher but not materially so than levels prior to the first half of 2014. Additionally, we expect to identify issues sooner which may result in the frequency of announced recalls increasing but the number of vehicles per recall and the cost per recall event would be down. As a result of changing how we estimate recall campaigns in North America, we took a 900 million non-cash pre-tax special charge during the quarter. This is our best estimate of the remaining recall expense we expect for the next 10 years for 30 million GM vehicles on the road today. On Slide 8, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we list the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our operating income margin for the second quarter for 2014 was a negative 1.2%, down significantly from the prior period as a result of recall-related expenses and the special items I reviewed earlier. Our EBIT adjusted margin decreased 2.4 percentage points to 3.4%. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.5 million vehicles in the second quarter, approximately an 8% decrease from the prior year and our global market share decreased 0.3 percentage points to 11.3%. On Slide 9, we explain a 900 million decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT adjusted. Volume was 300 million unfavorable due primarily to lower wholesale volumes in GMIO and GMSA as a result of the wind down of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and the challenging market conditions in South America. This was partially offset by higher wholesale volumes in GM North America. Mix was 200 million favorable primarily attributable to North America. Price was 1.1 billion favorable due primarily to recently launched vehicles in North America like the new full-size SUVs, full-size trucks and vehicles such as Corvette Stingray, as well as pricing performance in GM South America. Costs were 1.6 unfavorable including the impact of the 1.2 billion in recall-related costs in the quarter, 900 million in material costs associated with recently launched products, incremental restructuring expense of 200 million, partially offset by 500 million in fixed and variable cost improvement. Other was 300 million unfavorable primarily related to foreign exchange. Slide 10 gives our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segments GMNA decreased 600 million to 1.4 billion including 1 billion in recall-related expense. GME decreased 200 million to a loss of 300 million for the quarter primarily driven by 200 million in incremental restructuring expenses. The performance GMIO improved 100 million to 300 million and in South America EBIT adjusted decreased 100 million on a rounded basis to a loss of 100 million for the quarter. GM Financial continued to deliver solid results with 300 million in earnings before taxes adjusted for the period and our corporate sector was a 200 million loss, including 100 million in recall-related legal expenses for a total EBIT adjusted of 1.4 billion in Q2. We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators with GM North America on Slide 11. For the second quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 17.9%, flat versus the same period a year ago but up 90 basis points from the first quarter. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis were higher than the prior year period and slightly higher than the prior year quarter. Our incentives for the quarter were 10.6% of average transaction price. This puts us at a 108% of the industry average. Slide 12 shows GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue in this segment as a business was 25.7 billion, up 2.2 billion from the same quarter in 2013. GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted margin was 5.4% for the second quarter, which included the negative impact of 3.8 percentage points associated with recall-related expenses. Excluding the impact of recalls, GMNA\u2019s margin is above 9% for the quarter and is up over 115 basis points in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months of 2013. In fact, excluding the impact of recalls, GMNA EBIT adjusted margin has been up for four straight quarters on a year-over-year basis. Our U.S. dealer inventory increased to 799,000 vehicles, up from a year ago, but down approximately 17,000 units from the first quarter. This is equivalent of 72 day supply at the end of the June, down from 83 day supply at the end of Q1 and up slightly from 70 day supply a year ago. GMNA\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 830,000 units, 21,000 units higher than the prior year. North American market share came in at 17.2%, which was a 0.1%, point decline from the prior year period but higher than the prior year three quarters. On Slide 13, we provide the explanation of the 600 million year-over-year decrease in GMNA\u2019s EBIT adjusted. Volume was 200 million favorable due to the 21,000 unit increase in wholesale volumes driven by a growing industry and our successful products such as the full-size pickup trucks. Mix was 200 million favorable due to our full-size trucks and products such as the Corvette Stingray. Price was 800 million favorable on the strength of our full-size trucks and all new full-size SUVs. Cost was 1.6 billion unfavorable primarily due to the 1 billion of recall-related expenses and material costs associated with new launches, partially offset by fixed cost savings and material performance on carryover products. Other was 100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange. On Slide 14, GMA reported an EBIT adjusted loss of 300 million for the second quarter, a 200 million decrease from the prior year. Revenue increased 6.6% to 6 billion for the quarter and EBIT adjusted margin in the segment decreased 3.1 percentage points to a negative 5.1%, primarily attributable to incremental restructuring expenses. GME\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 305,000 units, up slightly from the prior year. And our European market share was 6.8%, down 0.9 percentage points from the prior year, primarily related to the wind down of the Chevrolet brand. As mentioned earlier, the Opel/Vauxhall brand increased sales nearly 4% in the first half of this year and market share increased 8 basis points year-to-date. After adjusting for incremental restructuring expense and despite challenges in Russia, GM Europe is near breakeven and well on its way towards profitability by mid-decade. On Slide 15, we provide the major components of GME\u2019s 200 million decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was flat as improving Western European markets were offset by conditions in Russia. Mix was also flat on a year-over-year basis. Price was flat as competitive pressure in the industry was partially offset by price recovery for foreign exchange. Cost was 100 million unfavorable primarily due to 200 million in incremental restructuring costs, partially offset by material and fixed cost savings. Other was 100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange. This totals to GME\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of 300 million for the second quarter of 2014. We\u2019ll now move on to GMIO\u2019s profitability for the prior five quarters on Slide 16. EBIT adjusted was 300 million including 500 million in equity income from our joint ventures. At the bottom of the slide, GMIO\u2019s revenue from consolidated operations was 3.6 billion. The 1.2 billion declined from Q2 2013 is primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in the Middle East and Chevrolet brand vehicles in Europe. Consolidated operations\u2019 EBIT adjusted margin was a negative 5.7%, down significantly from the prior year, primarily related to reduced volumes in the region. Our net income margin from our China JVs remains strong at 10%, up 0.6 percentage points year-over-year. The region\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 157,000 for its consolidated operations and 830,000 for our China JVs, which was up 7.5% from the prior period in China. Our market share in Asia-Pacific Middle East and Africa region was 9.7%, flat from a year ago. Our market share in China was 14.4% for the first six months of the year, relatively flat compared to the first six months of last year as we work to keep pace with the quickly growing industry. On Slide 17, we provide the major components of GMIO\u2019s year-over-year performance. Volume was 300 million unfavorable due to 83,000 unit decline in wholesale volumes in our consolidated operations. Mix was flat on a year-over-year basis. Price was 100 million favorable primarily in our Middle East operations. Cost was a 200 million tailwind associated with the wind down of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and lower cost in Australia, India and Middle East markets, partially offset by incremental recall and restructuring expenses. Other was 100 million favorable due to improved equity income from our strong China operations. Going forward, we continue to expect our China business to remain strong. With regard to consolidate operations, we should see the benefit of important launches of the new full-size pickup trucks and full-size SUVs in the Middle East. Slide 18, provides a look at GM South America\u2019s performance in recent quarters. Revenue decreased 1.1 billion to 3.2 billion primarily due to lower wholesale volumes and foreign exchange, partially offset by favorable pricing and mix. The EBIT adjusted margin in this segment was a negative 2.5%, 3.8 percentage points lower than the prior year. GM South America\u2019s wholesale vehicle sales were 211,000 units, 67,000 lower than the second quarter of 2013 and South American market share declined to 16.7% in the quarter. On Slide 19, we look at the change in year-over-year EBIT adjusted, a decrease of 100 million. Volume decreased 200 million primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela. Mix was flat. Price was 200 million favorable due to actions we have taken in Argentina and Brazil to partially offset foreign exchange in those markets. Cost was flat as incremental restructuring expense was offset by fixed cost savings. Other had a 200 million adverse impact primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina. This totals to an EBIT adjusted loss of 100 million in GM South America in the second quarter. Slide 20 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the second quarter. As a reminder, our net income to common stockholders was 200 million. After adjusting for non-controlling interests and Series A preferred dividends and deducting GM Financial earnings our automotive income was 100 million. We had 800 million in non-cash special items. And our depreciation and amortization was 1.6 billion expense. Working capital was a 600 million use of cash. The variance from prior year is primarily due to production timing. Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by 200 million in the quarter. Other was 1.9 billion primarily attributable to recall charges during the quarter, evidenced from China joint ventures and timing of sales incentive accruals versus payments. This totals to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of 3.6 billion. We have 1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of 1.9 billion. On Slide 21, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the second quarter with 28.4 billion in cash and current marketable securities and 10.4 billion in available credit facilities for a total available liquidity of 38.8 billion. Our book value of debt was 7.5 billion and our Series A preferred stock obligation was 3.1 billion. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans were underfunded by 7 billion and our non-U.S. pensions were underfunded by 12.3 billion. Our unfunded OPEB liability was 6.3 billion in the second quarter. Slide 22 provides a brief summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial has already released the results and will hold their earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the second quarter was 8.1% down 0.4 percentage points from the prior year. Our U.S. lease penetration increased 4.3 percentage points to 24.2% in Q2, as we continue to leverage our financing relationships and improve residual values to drive toward industry competitive levels in key segments. Lease penetration in Canada was at 27.5% up significantly from last year, but more in line with industry. GM new vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations rose to 75% and GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing was 30% in the quarter. GM Financial\u2019s annualized net credit losses remained low at 1.4% and their earnings before tax adjusted were 258 million for the second quarter. Reflecting both continued strong performance of their North American business and international operations. Finally, on Slide 23 we highlight a few areas of focus for the second half of the year. Customer care remains our top priority as a Company, we will continue to work with our suppliers, our dealers and others to repair recalled vehicles as quickly as we can and to continue to focus on improving our processors around our vehicle safety and commitment to our customers. We have some important launches in the second half of this year in many of our regions. We will continue to focus on the important work of delivering flawless vehicle launches and introductions in these important markets. With the successful new vehicle launches we\u2019ve had thus far, we continue to generate strong results in the U.S. and China and we remain on-track to be profitable in Europe by mid-decade. We are confident we are currently on or ahead of plan to deliver the results we promised earlier this year excluding the effects of recalls. Finally, Mary will have more to say about our second half focus in her closing remarks. But I want you to know that we are committed as a Company to continue driving the strong underlying cooperating performance we delivered in the first half of this year, across all regions and despite the challenges we face. Now Mary and I will take your questions after which Mary will have some closing remarks, Sandy? Question: and: Operator : Thank you, sir. Please note that the question-and-answer session is for analysts only. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed sir. Rod Lache : Can you help us first of all with that Slide 13 that $1.6 billion cost number, you did say that about a 1 billion of that was recall, would it be reasonable to say that maybe 900 million was content, last quarter was around a 1 billion and that you had maybe 300 million of positive structural cost items is that a good estimation of that breakdown? Deutsche Bank : Can you help us first of all with that Slide 13 that $1.6 billion cost number, you did say that about a 1 billion of that was recall, would it be reasonable to say that maybe 900 million was content, last quarter was around a 1 billion and that you had maybe 300 million of positive structural cost items is that a good estimation of that breakdown? Chuck Stevens : Yes. That\u2019s close, Rod out of the 1.6 billion as we indicated roughly a 1 billion related to recall activity. Material on majors was 1.1 billion unfavorable partially offset by GPS carryover material performance of a couple $100 million and the balance was fixed-cost. Rod Lache : Okay. So, if that\u2019s right material a 1 billion and maybe it\u2019s a 900 million net of some cost savings and older items, how do we kind of put that into context against the pricing that you had in the quarter which was 800 million it would look like the contribution would be somewhat negative and it\u2019s still, it\u2019s kind of early days when you compare the pricing versus the material right now a lot of these products are pretty new, is there anything to kind of read into that? Deutsche Bank : Okay. So, if that\u2019s right material a 1 billion and maybe it\u2019s a 900 million net of some cost savings and older items, how do we kind of put that into context against the pricing that you had in the quarter which was 800 million it would look like the contribution would be somewhat negative and it\u2019s still, it\u2019s kind of early days when you compare the pricing versus the material right now a lot of these products are pretty new, is there anything to kind of read into that? Chuck Stevens : Pricing on majors for North America in the quarter was $1.4 billion against that material cost, material and majors for North America specifically Rod it was 1.1 billion, so roughly accretive to earnings 300 million. I mentioned material performance on carryover favorable 200 million, so carryover pricing was unfavorable in the quarter on a year-over-year basis about $600 million. Rod Lache : Okay. But this is arguably the peak of the Company\u2019s product cycle and the combination of new products versus carryover products is not, that doesn\u2019t appear to be favorable at this point. Is that something that we should be thinking about sort of in the context of the longer term margin target and I know you are doing north of 9% right now but the longer-term margin target for North America being closer to 10? Deutsche Bank : Okay. But this is arguably the peak of the Company\u2019s product cycle and the combination of new products versus carryover products is not, that doesn\u2019t appear to be favorable at this point. Is that something that we should be thinking about sort of in the context of the longer term margin target and I know you are doing north of 9% right now but the longer-term margin target for North America being closer to 10? Chuck Stevens : Yes, I would say we are still confident and convicted around our glide path to 10% EBIT margins, Rod. I would suggest that we still have a significant portion of the launch cadence out in front of us. As we\u2019ve indicated before we will be launching products in the 2014 to \u201917 timeframe at twice the pace of the previous four years. So I think that there is continued opportunity from a pricing on new content as I\u2019ve discussed before, the carryover pricing dynamic versus where we were sitting a year ago is becoming a bit more challenging and that\u2019s why we need to focus on cost and efficiency which is really the second leg of our glide path to 10% EBIT margins. Rod Lache : And just lastly if I can sneak another couple of things in, can you just clarify your wholesale of 830,000 units it looks like it was maybe 60,000 units lower than production, is that just rental car accounting and do you have any just broad color on the outlook for the back half for South America, or the consolidated IO business? Deutsche Bank : And just lastly if I can sneak another couple of things in, can you just clarify your wholesale of 830,000 units it looks like it was maybe 60,000 units lower than production, is that just rental car accounting and do you have any just broad color on the outlook for the back half for South America, or the consolidated IO business? Chuck Stevens : For the first question, Rod, absolutely right that is just rental car, the difference between in service versus auction. So over the next 9 to 12 months that will bleed out, that\u2019s the biggest difference between production and wholesales. Relative to South America, it continues to be a very challenging environment. Brazil and Argentina, the industry continues to weaken, but in the context of overall results, we continue to execute to our plan to driving efficiency in those operations and I would expect absent some change to see slightly improved performance in the second half of the year. Our consolidated operations as we\u2019ve talked before. We\u2019ve got a number of important product launches in the second half of the year primarily led by full size pickups and full size SUVs in the Middle-East. So again I would expect to see some marginal improvement from our consolidated operations run rate as we get into the second half of the year. And while we are at it from a company standpoint, as we\u2019ve discussed before, we believe the second half of the year is going to be stronger than the first half of the year ex-recall and we are still confident that we are on or ahead of plan for the year. Operator :  Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed with your question. Itay Michaeli :  Chuck, hoping we can maybe talk about the second half outlook in North America, it sounds like you still are confident in the second half of the year. What are some of the big buckets we should be thinking about there both in terms of in particularly a focus on kind of the pricing versus material cost equation in the second half of the year? Citigroup:  Chuck, hoping we can maybe talk about the second half outlook in North America, it sounds like you still are confident in the second half of the year. What are some of the big buckets we should be thinking about there both in terms of in particularly a focus on kind of the pricing versus material cost equation in the second half of the year? Chuck Stevens :  Yes I wouldn\u2019t say that our expectations for North America is that we will grow margins in the second half of the year versus the first half ex-recalls and also grow margins versus the second half of last year. The big drivers behind that will be continuing the full size SUV launch and getting that up to run and eliminating some of the constraints that we\u2019ve had a from a production perspective. We will have the ATS Coupe launch later this year from a Cadillac perspective, mid-size truck is later in the year I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a big driver of earnings. Generally 60% of the truck industry is in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So we expect continued strength from a volume and mix perspective as well. Itay Michaeli : That\u2019s very helpful. And then two quick follow-ups, first it does sound like you raised your outlook for the mid-decade in Europe from breakeven to profitable and maybe a subtle change. But maybe talk a little bit about what may have driven that? And then secondly just a quick housekeeping, what\u2019s sort of the cash recall cost that\u2019s still -- which you will be expecting over the next several quarters? Citigroup: That\u2019s very helpful. And then two quick follow-ups, first it does sound like you raised your outlook for the mid-decade in Europe from breakeven to profitable and maybe a subtle change. But maybe talk a little bit about what may have driven that? And then secondly just a quick housekeeping, what\u2019s sort of the cash recall cost that\u2019s still -- which you will be expecting over the next several quarters? Chuck Stevens :  Okay, yes. Speaking to Europe first, I think it\u2019s a combination of a number of things. First we continue to get traction in the core markets. Germany, the UK with Opel and with Vauxhall. The brand\u2019s strength continues to improve the wind down of Chevrolet Europe is ahead of planning going much smoother than we expected about 80% of the dealers that are in wind downs have signed up with Opel as well. So that\u2019s going extremely well. And the industry is performing a little bit better than we expected. The other thing that\u2019s driving that with that strength is we are going into the heart of the product launch cadence with the Corsa letter this year and the Astra next year. On the recall cash component of that, our expectations, Itay, is that 60% to 70% of the $2.5 billion that we booked thus far will result in a cash impact in the second half of the year with the balance rolling out into Q1-Q2 next year that\u2019s our latest thinking on that. Itay Michaeli : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks everyone.  Citigroup: Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks everyone. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Brian Johnson : Yes. Good morning. I have a housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. On the housekeeping question just following up on the wholesale versus sale, retail sales. If we just kind of look at it from retail sales at the dealer level and inventory build, it looks like that number from what you\u2019ve put out there was about 910,000 this quarter you only had 830,000 wholesale units that\u2019s a difference of about 77,000, if I look over the last four quarters of that delta, it\u2019s never got above 26,000. Is there something different going on with either the volume of rental programs, how much they want to do this program versus race cars? Is there anything with GM Financial\u2019s leasing business that\u2019s going to affect recognition of our wholesale sale and then kind of how does that play out going forward or a potential program business outside of daily rental? Barclays Capital : Yes. Good morning. I have a housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. On the housekeeping question just following up on the wholesale versus sale, retail sales. If we just kind of look at it from retail sales at the dealer level and inventory build, it looks like that number from what you\u2019ve put out there was about 910,000 this quarter you only had 830,000 wholesale units that\u2019s a difference of about 77,000, if I look over the last four quarters of that delta, it\u2019s never got above 26,000. Is there something different going on with either the volume of rental programs, how much they want to do this program versus race cars? Is there anything with GM Financial\u2019s leasing business that\u2019s going to affect recognition of our wholesale sale and then kind of how does that play out going forward or a potential program business outside of daily rental? Chuck Stevens : Yes, I think your question was around the difference between production and wholesales this time versus the\u2026 Brian Johnson : No, actually the difference between dealer sales and dealer inventory build and wholesale sales\u2026 Barclays Capital : No, actually the difference between dealer sales and dealer inventory build and wholesale sales\u2026 Chuck Stevens : Okay well\u2026 Brian Johnson :  In a different way than from production. Barclays Capital :  In a different way than from production. Chuck Stevens : Yes as vehicles are sold to daily rental while the revenue and associated costs are reverses and then amortize over the anticipated life of that buyback agreement the deliveries are counted in the quarter that when they are delivered to the rental. So that would answer the first question. And relative to the dynamic with daily rental, the first half of the year is the typical seasonal pattern and if you look over the last few years is always fairly significant difference between production and wholesales especially in the second quarter. I would also say the dynamic within daily rental to your other comment has changed a bit. We are taking advantage of strong our residual value, used car values, and putting more in repurchase so that we can control that and control that inventory as it comes out. Our overall fleet penetration is relatively flat year-over-year. So from a total sales perspective so there is no dynamic there that is an anomaly. It\u2019s just timing and more repurchase versus risk unit. Brian Johnson : Okay. Because I\u2019d like it some of our estimates about a big chunk of the -- your model versus -- your results versus our model seem to be 30k wholesale units and what I am hearing is you\u2019re doing more program business with rental car companies and that\u2019s can affect the timing therefore the wholesale sales? Barclays Capital : Okay. Because I\u2019d like it some of our estimates about a big chunk of the -- your model versus -- your results versus our model seem to be 30k wholesale units and what I am hearing is you\u2019re doing more program business with rental car companies and that\u2019s can affect the timing therefore the wholesale sales? Chuck Stevens : Correct. Brian Johnson : On a more strategic in China I think this is the second quarter in a row we\u2019ve seen a year-over-year gain and earnings margins are holding. I do know you sent a new executive to China last year and maybe from the point of view of Mary what do you think is driving this improvement in the equity income from China and in particular -- and maybe it is a Dan Ammann question as well is there a mandate now to actually not just hold market share in China but to grow equity income and profits? Barclays Capital : On a more strategic in China I think this is the second quarter in a row we\u2019ve seen a year-over-year gain and earnings margins are holding. I do know you sent a new executive to China last year and maybe from the point of view of Mary what do you think is driving this improvement in the equity income from China and in particular -- and maybe it is a Dan Ammann question as well is there a mandate now to actually not just hold market share in China but to grow equity income and profits? Mary Barra : There is definitely a mandate to do that there continues to be huge growth potential when you look across the globe I know people talk about China slowing but it\u2019s still is a huge opportunity from a growth perspective. And if you look at some of what\u2019s feeling that is the SUV that we\u2019ve recently launched but there is still much more work to do and opportunity when you look across the Chevrolet portfolio the dealer\u2019s portfolio which continues to be strong, and then the Cadillac portfolio that\u2019s doing well as well. So we\u2019re really investing in not only building the brands but then also at our first -- my first trip there at the beginning of the year and I think it was reinforcing messages of the past as the market grows we need to participate in that growth in cases in a disproportionate fashion to make sure that we\u2019re seizing the opportunity. So I think the team has really come together and look for every opportunity we continue to have our plans to increase capacity and continue to build the brand. So I expect that trend to continue. Brian Johnson : And was it one thing specific that maybe added to the bottom-line there it\u2019s just a bunch of actions? Barclays Capital : And was it one thing specific that maybe added to the bottom-line there it\u2019s just a bunch of actions? Mary Barra : I think it\u2019s a number of actions I think it was again somewhat product drive somewhat driven by the focus of the team and the clear expectations laid out and the work that we need to do and the convey as it relates to the brands. I think Cadillac is also significant as well. Brian Johnson : Now you\u2019re guiding to margins lower in second half 9% to 10% versus 11% is that just seasonality when the product program launches and kind of should we be thinking about the 10ish percent margin going forward on a full year basis? Barclays Capital : Now you\u2019re guiding to margins lower in second half 9% to 10% versus 11% is that just seasonality when the product program launches and kind of should we be thinking about the 10ish percent margin going forward on a full year basis? Chuck Stevens : Yes, 10% is ballpark the right number to think about on a full year basis. There is seasonality in China typically Q1 is stronger than Q2. We\u2019re holding to 10% EBIT margins on a go forward basis. So as' we\u2019ve indicated we expect the growth of Cadillac and launch of a number of SUVs to be a tailwind from a margin perspective but as you know the market in China from a pricing perspective on carryover is challenging roughly 3% per year, net price deterioration. So we will hold our margins by improving mix and continuing to drive cost efficiency to offset those price headwinds, that\u2019s the broad strokes of the plan, Brian. Operator : Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my question. Can you give any -- you said the cadence of earnings is the same, but it does look like restructuring is a little bit more even through the year. How should we think about the restructuring? Is the $1.1 billion for the year still good, or is it actually coming in a bit lower than you were thinking? UBS: Great, thanks for taking my question. Can you give any -- you said the cadence of earnings is the same, but it does look like restructuring is a little bit more even through the year. How should we think about the restructuring? Is the $1.1 billion for the year still good, or is it actually coming in a bit lower than you were thinking? Chuck Stevens : Yes. Colin to you first comment, I think what we said was in the second half we expect earnings to be better during the first half, so not equal on a cadence perspective. And then from restructuring, we talk about the 1.1 billion for the year. I would say in the first half of the year we\u2019re generally on-track on a run rate basis to that 1.1 billion, the biggest driver of that is the restructuring events in Germany. And that is pretty flat quarter-to-quarter. So I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a material difference in the second half versus the first half of restructuring. Colin Langan : And how should we think about the restructuring potential in GMIO? Obviously, with the end of Chevy in Europe, what are the plans for that plant that was supplying those Chevy products? UBS: And how should we think about the restructuring potential in GMIO? Obviously, with the end of Chevy in Europe, what are the plans for that plant that was supplying those Chevy products? Chuck Stevens : We continue to look at optimizing our footprint in Korea associated with the wind down take, I would say for the year restructuring across in IO are in the range of a $100 to $150 million it\u2019s really largely dependent on voluntary separation program and we work through that. And we\u2019ll continue to work through that over the next number of years. Australia, as we indicated before we will continue to work through that restructuring between now and 2017 and that will be part of the run rate that I talk about before we would expect in the range of $400 to $500 million of your restructuring on an ongoing basis. Colin Langan : Okay and just one last one. Can you clarify when you've talked in the past about mid-decade, that doesn't mean 2015, is that correct, when we think about both Europe getting back to profitability and the North America 10% margin? Is that the right way to think about that, somewhere in that range is the way to think of it? UBS: Okay and just one last one. Can you clarify when you've talked in the past about mid-decade, that doesn't mean 2015, is that correct, when we think about both Europe getting back to profitability and the North America 10% margin? Is that the right way to think about that, somewhere in that range is the way to think of it? Chuck Stevens : Yes. The way to think about it is mid-decade. I\u2019m not going to give any more specifics in that Colin aspect to say this. We are on-track in executing to the North American plan, if you look at the last four quarters on a year-over-year basis. Our margins are up, excluding recalls a 150 basis point, clearly we feel more optimistic and forward leading in Europe because we\u2019ve changed our guidance from breakeven mid decade to profit, our mid decade, we continue to work it extremely hard, but I would say for both of those commitments we are on-track. Colin Langan : Okay, alright, thank you very much.  UBS: Okay, alright, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. John Murphy : Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on sort of the product cadence and the cadence of earnings that you are expecting in the second half this year, particularly in North America. And Chuck, specifically, and Mary, it seems like there is an over focus in the market that you are sort of it's a one and done product cadence with the K2XX, Silverado and SUV launches. But there's a lot more to the product launch as far as I can tell. I'm just curious if you can maybe either confirm or comment on the product launches going forward. It seems like the HD launches will benefit the second half of this year and the first half of next year. And then over the next two years, you have the launches of the small crossovers, the large crossovers, and some midsize sedans here in North America that should be real positive as the market remains tight. So I'm just curious if you can comment on sort of that statement, and really this concern that you are sort of a one and done product cycle here, because it just seems very misguided right now? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on sort of the product cadence and the cadence of earnings that you are expecting in the second half this year, particularly in North America. And Chuck, specifically, and Mary, it seems like there is an over focus in the market that you are sort of it's a one and done product cadence with the K2XX, Silverado and SUV launches.

So I'm just curious if you can comment on sort of that statement, and really this concern that you are sort of a one and done product cycle here, because it just seems very misguided right now? Mary Barra : Yes. Couple of points on that, first you\u2019re absolutely correct specially even if you look at our full size trucks, there is more coming as we continue to look at the -- through the life time of the K2XX they are not going to get out in front and announcing, stick to our announcement cadence, but there\u2019s definitely more substantial things coming to enhance the K2XX over its lifecycle. Also I think the importance of the midsize truck that comes out later this year and then it\u2019s truck is that there is clearly strong cadence of products coming out of it with the next couple of years that I think, there\u2019s been, they\u2019ve had the ability to have the complete focus of our work on material cost for those products and optimization of -- you\u2019ll say revenue in the cost aspect of it. So you\u2019re correct, it\u2019s not just a one and done there is significant more coming not only the K2XX which we understand is very significant to have it do et cetera, but other products as well. John Murphy : Okay. Then just a second question, Mary, on following up on all the retail activity and sort of the re-measurements you seem to be doing and sort of everything you've been digging up. There's always been a question with GM's IT systems and your ability to really measure and metricize and respond to things like these recalls. I am just curious as you are going through this process if there's anything you really think you might need to revamp more on a structural basis on the IT systems in GM, so you can understand better and more quickly what's necessarily going on in the Company? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Then just a second question, Mary, on following up on all the retail activity and sort of the re-measurements you seem to be doing and sort of everything you've been digging up. There's always been a question with GM's IT systems and your ability to really measure and metricize and respond to things like these recalls. I am just curious as you are going through this process if there's anything you really think you might need to revamp more on a structural basis on the IT systems in GM, so you can understand better and more quickly what's necessarily going on in the Company? Mary Barra : I am not sure I completely understand your question, but it is specifically related to recalls. I mean I think there is data, the ease of which data is available but I am not going to pin it on IT systems. I mean it\u2019s clearly the trunk process that we need to have within the company that\u2019s process driven, people driven and I think we\u2019ve addressed that completely with the creation of the Jeff Boyer organization and the way that structures the way that operates across the company. I would also say the way that we\u2019ve really in that area, are comprehensively looking at data to understand what the customer is seeing or experiencing, whether it comes directly from customer calls, emails, or customer engagement center, warranty information, legal claims. Also we have a team that just mines data off the internet to make sure we understand as customers raise issues. So that is comprehensive of what we are doing that. Now there is an opportunity to do that better and our IT team is working hands in hand with Jeff, because we feel and any extra we\u2019re finding outside expertise as well to make sure we\u2019ve got the right tools to more quickly be able to mine data and spot trends or see connect point. But, so there is an IT aspect of it and we are well underway doing that and we will continue to just advance that. But I think the most important point to make sure that we are looking across and understand what\u2019s happening with our vehicles is the way we completely change the organization, change the process we follow and make it very clear to the entire organization what the expectations are. Chuck Stevens : Just to speak a bit to the financial systems and IT, I think you\u2019ve seen this, there has been a significant improvement in that over the last two or three years along with the finance transformation and IT transformation and obviously more work to go, but starting with country sale reporting, product line profitability we are launching globally profitability on a win level basis. We are building an enterprise data warehouse with the business intelligence group so there is a lot of work that\u2019s been going on and we will continue to go on from specifically a financial perspective so that we can get the right data, analyze it quickly and react and I think that we are well along the way on that. John Murphy : And we are looking forward to the VIN level profitability, if you will disclose it to us? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And we are looking forward to the VIN level profitability, if you will disclose it to us? Chuck Stevens : We won\u2019t. John Murphy : One last question on subprime, particularly because GM Financial has a big exposure there. There's obviously a great debate in the markets right now of subprime being overheated for auto lending. It doesn't necessarily appear that way to us. I was just curious if you could comment on sort of your exposure to subprime, what you think of it right now, and is it more of an issue or an opportunity? Bank of America Merrill Lynch : One last question on subprime, particularly because GM Financial has a big exposure there. There's obviously a great debate in the markets right now of subprime being overheated for auto lending. It doesn't necessarily appear that way to us. I was just curious if you could comment on sort of your exposure to subprime, what you think of it right now, and is it more of an issue or an opportunity? Chuck Stevens : That\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s been interesting, our share of sub-prime actually has come down because for a while there was a competitive move into sub-prime so it was being reasonably well served, it looked like in the second quarter that there was a back off from that a little bit perhaps because of the exposures. Let\u2019s just say that AmeriCredit, now GM Financial are experts in sub-prime, they never lost money during the downturn in 2008-2009, they know how to manage and score these customers. And I think that manage an appropriate level of risk associated with sub-prime, and again, as they expand our overall product offering. So we feel that that\u2019s a very, very well managed segment of their business. John Murphy : Okay, thank you very much.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed sir. Patrick Archambault : Thank you, good morning. I guess a couple from me. Just first, I think there was some production constraints, I think, referenced towards the beginning of the call when we were discussing the cadence of margins and the overall North America performance. So maybe we could get into that. Obviously, just sort of the newer truck models and SUV models that are kind of rolling off, sort of how far are you away from the sort of true run rate of production? And as we think about -- how do we think about that, and how meaningful it is in subsequent quarters? Goldman Sachs : Thank you, good morning. I guess a couple from me. Just first, I think there was some production constraints, I think, referenced towards the beginning of the call when we were discussing the cadence of margins and the overall North America performance. So maybe we could get into that. Obviously, just sort of the newer truck models and SUV models that are kind of rolling off, sort of how far are you away from the sort of true run rate of production? And as we think about -- how do we think about that, and how meaningful it is in subsequent quarters? Chuck Stevens : Yes, I would say it\u2019s not an overall system production constraint more specific mix. We talked about this before. The higher penetration trim levels, the crew cab versus double cab versus regular cab mix have performed much better than we expected and we\u2019ve been working hard in the first half of the year with suppliers, with engineering to address these bottlenecks. What we currently have right now from a full size SUV perspective there are some constraints on escalate, up level escalate in Denali, the Yukon Denali. We are continue to work through that, we have the expectation that we will build a free up some of those trim constraints as we go into the second half of the year. So it\u2019s not like an overall capacity but more specific up level trim constraints that we\u2019ve had and I think that\u2019s going to be net of positive benefit in the second half versus the first half. Patrick Archambault : Okay, that's helpful clarification. Then my follow-up was just on Brazil and Latin America specifically. I know you did address it a little bit, but I wasn't sure if some of the color you provided was GMIO. So maybe can we just, at the risk of repeating some of that, can we talk about what the anticipation is sort of for the back half? I would also be curious, specifically are there concerns about inventory levels there? It's one of the things that we have been hearing about that, with sort of the general buyers' strike going on ahead of the elections, people are just stuck with a lot of stock that they need to get rid of in the second half. Goldman Sachs : Okay, that's helpful clarification. Then my follow-up was just on Brazil and Latin America specifically. I know you did address it a little bit, but I wasn't sure if some of the color you provided was GMIO. So maybe can we just, at the risk of repeating some of that, can we talk about what the anticipation is sort of for the back half?

It's one of the things that we have been hearing about that, with sort of the general buyers' strike going on ahead of the elections, people are just stuck with a lot of stock that they need to get rid of in the second half. Chuck Stevens : Yes, let\u2019s talk about Brazil, South America. Clearly, the first half of the year impacted by Venezuela fundamentally no production and we\u2019re carrying all the fixed costs associated with that. There has been I am not getting overly optimistic but there has been some positive movement recently relative to currency releases. It looks like we will be able to put a -- some level of production in the second half of the year in Venezuela. So that would be one of the drivers of the second half versus the first half performance. The big question mark for us right now is how does Brazil and Argentina, how do those industries perform going forward whether there is just a hangover from the World Cup and things are going to normalize it appears that the government is trying to supportive of the industry by holding off and raising IPI tax. So, we\u2019re optimistic that there is some upside in the second half from Brazil and Argentina. I think the key thing is that we continue to execute the plan that we led out and drive efficiency and fixed costs we continue to do restructuring there and take people out of the system and optimize manufacturing. We\u2019re continuing to drive localization and improve logistics. And relative to your question on inventory specifically, we saw that coming and part of the challenge in the second quarter on our South American earnings specific to Brazil is we took a lot of production out in the second quarter in advance of the World Cup because fundamentally the country shutdown. So we tried to get out in front of that inventory issue in the second quarter. Patrick Archambault : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Continuing on our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Ryan Brinkman : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I think that the North America margin of 9.2% ex recall likely tracked below some of the higher-end expectations. At the same time, I think investors believed that you would be cyclically helped by product cadence in 2014, to such an extent that your margin ex recall would likely decline next year. You've said before, though, that you think that in the march toward reaching by mid-decade a run rate of margin that personally 10% over the course of a business cycle that the intention would be to turn higher and higher margins each year until you get to that goal. So my question is if investors are modestly disappointed today with the current GMNA margin because they think it is benefiting from a peaking product cadence, what can you tell them that would give them the confidence in the mid-decade target that you repeated today you have conviction in? It seems like in Mary's response earlier to a similar question, she'd somewhat disputed the fact that product cadence was currently peaking. What other margin drivers are there out there that are going to help you? If you could please just kind of walk us through those multiyear drivers and trajectory margin in a way that would make us excited.  JPMorgan: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I think that the North America margin of 9.2% ex recall likely tracked below some of the higher-end expectations.

What other margin drivers are there out there that are going to help you? If you could please just kind of walk us through those multiyear drivers and trajectory margin in a way that would make us excited. Chuck Stevens : Thanks Ryan. First I would say look at the track record of execution. Going back to 2012 through today and we\u2019ve been pretty clear that our objective was to grow from 7% to 7.5% EBIT margins by 300 basis points and that was going to be over a multiyear period trenched in a 100 basis points roughly over three year time frame more or less. Count to-date for the last 12 months we\u2019ve grown margins in North America 150 basis points on a year-over-year basis ex-recall. So, we\u2019re executing to the plan. As Mary indicated and I\u2019ve talked about before, our launch cycle, our launch cadence over the next four years is going to be at twice the pace it was in the previous four years. So it\u2019s not a one end done with the full size trucks. As we talked about the glide path, the first trench of the margin expansion was going to be driven to a large extent by launches. The second trench really around cost and efficiency primarily manufacturing footprint, the SG&A initiatives we have with Global Business Services IT transformation and material costs and logistics optimization and those are all in execution mode. And then the final driver of margin expansion was really around fully leveraging the business and that was the expansion of GM Financial that was growing our customer carrying after sales business by expanding our reach in the after sales market beyond traditional dealer parts with F&I products gap extended warranty and that was really by fully leveraging global connected customer and our capability with 4G LTE and our ability to manage the customer. So, this has been a laid out plan since 2012 we\u2019re executing to it and we\u2019re one third of the way through it and we put the numbers on the board thus far that we talked about and that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to continue to execute to that plan. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Thanks. Then just my second and final question, it looks like you are making progress on reducing your losses in consolidated international operations. I thought maybe the moves that you were making their relative to Chevrolet in Europe would benefit earnings for GM Europe, that pressure of consolidated IO as you take out production before you take out capacity. I know that consolidated IO is more there is a lot of moving pieces. But it would seem that the stopping of the export of Chevrolet vehicles might actually have improved profitability, suggesting that the variable contribution on those vehicles might have even been negative. Can we look forward to maybe another leg in improved profitability for consolidated IO as you go ahead and now take out that capacity that's no longer needed to support those vehicles that were previously exported? JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thanks. Then just my second and final question, it looks like you are making progress on reducing your losses in consolidated international operations. I thought maybe the moves that you were making their relative to Chevrolet in Europe would benefit earnings for GM Europe, that pressure of consolidated IO as you take out production before you take out capacity. I know that consolidated IO is more there is a lot of moving pieces. But it would seem that the stopping of the export of Chevrolet vehicles might actually have improved profitability, suggesting that the variable contribution on those vehicles might have even been negative. Can we look forward to maybe another leg in improved profitability for consolidated IO as you go ahead and now take out that capacity that's no longer needed to support those vehicles that were previously exported? Chuck Stevens : Well first, Chevrolet Europe results were reported and are continued to reported in the IO sector. So by itself is as we wind down Chevrolet, you expect that to be ultimately a net positive as a matter of fact in the second quarter, part of the fixed cost improvement that we saw in IOs driven by reduced fixed costs related to Chevrolet Europe. At the same time, we created a fairly significant capacity issue for ourselves in Korea that we need to deal with. We took roughly 200,000 units of Chevrolet Europe volume out that created a underutilized footprint and we are working to address that, that\u2019s got a bit longer tail on it to get fully addressed. We\u2019re going to have to manage through that as we go forward. For me, from an international operations perspective, the key that\u2019s going to change the dynamic from our -- significantly change the dynamic from an earnings trajectory perspective is going to be product. And we are working very hard on an emerging market portfolio, that\u2019s first and foremost. Then get the business model, the infrastructure right around that portfolio and then make sure that at the market dealer network, the brands are ready and built to the levels so that we can fully optimize that. So that\u2019s kind of the strategic footprint for IO. Mary Barra : If I can just add to that I mean I think there, again with the improvements that we\u2019ve made from a financial data availability to manage the business across the country or across the globe, country-by-country as we look at the consolidated international operations, we are really looking at what is the take to winning those markets, to be in the core of the market as Chuck said to have the product cadence and then right systems and business plan around it. And I think if you look at several of the last few months personal announcements that we\u2019ve made, there is also a new leadership team across the board that fully understands their responsibility to look at it holistically but make sure in each of those countries, we have a winning plan centered around products, but broader across the business and so we are watching that closely working with that team. Ryan Brinkman : Great, thank you both for all the color.  JPMorgan: Great, thank you both for all the color. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. My first question was just on the logic of including the majority of the recall costs in adjusted EBIT, which traditionally was a metric to kind of demonstrate underlying profitability. And I know the intentions are honorable and you've explained it that unlike other companies and maybe even yourself in the past, you want to not hide these things and have them upfront and in the adjusted number. But I would imagine recalling 29 million recalls is pretty extraordinary. And just the reason why I'm asking is a lot of investors are owning your stock on the expectation of, let's say, real underlying EBIT improvement. And you maybe unintentionally put yourself in a situation where just holding the underlying profit stable, you could have like a 40% or 50% increase in EBIT next year just on not recalling the vehicles again.  Morgan Stanley : Thanks, everybody.

Chuck Stevens : Yes, I am sorry, Adam. Go ahead. Adam Jonas : So I just wanted to note of the thought process and logic there because it could create some different let\u2019s say management expectations versus investor expectations? Morgan Stanley : So I just wanted to note of the thought process and logic there because it could create some different let\u2019s say management expectations versus investor expectations? Chuck Stevens : Historically, we have taken recall campaigns to EBIT adjusted and in the first half of this year, we certainly talked about whether we should think about this as a special item or not but ultimately it boiled down to a responsibility perspective. Operating management-to-management the leadership of this organization, we are responsible for those charges and we wanted to make sure that it was reflected appropriately in EBIT adjusted for a number of reasons. I think that the go forward approach to this as you\u2019ve seen as we\u2019ve got more data in the special non-cash charges we took in the second quarter, we are going to accrue recall campaigns on a perspective basis as sold, which were more closely aligned with the competition and eliminate some of the volatility that we\u2019ve seen on a go forward basis. Adam Jonas : Okay. Can I just ask is the incentive structure, are there any adjustments to the management incentive structure though to adjust for that so that you are not let\u2019s say rewarded for just non-repeat of recall costs? Morgan Stanley : Okay. Can I just ask is the incentive structure, are there any adjustments to the management incentive structure though to adjust for that so that you are not let\u2019s say rewarded for just non-repeat of recall costs? Marry Barra :  I am not sure I have completely understand your question Adam, but\u2026 Adam Jonas : Just to clarify the -- my understanding is a significant proportion of variable compensation is tied to delta of adjusted EBIT of the company, that\u2019s the heart of what I am asking about. Morgan Stanley : Just to clarify the -- my understanding is a significant proportion of variable compensation is tied to delta of adjusted EBIT of the company, that\u2019s the heart of what I am asking about. Marry Barra :  But look I think that the key is part of it wasn\u2019t treated as a special item. I mean we don\u2019t broadly comment on executive compensation other than what we disclose on an annual basis but I would say I think we are responsible, it\u2019s our -- the basic need to do a recall is when you -- something is wrong with the vehicle from a customer perspective and that\u2019s the core of the business and that\u2019s how we treated all of the vehicles. Adam Jonas : I appreciate that. Just last as a follow-up and I know you won't be able to pinpoint it, but the recall itself has obviously been a very important stimulus for showroom traffic at dealers. And I was wondering if when you analyze that and in discussion with your dealers, do you think that the recall activity has been a net positive to your volume and a chance to kind of reengage and rebuild trust and maybe offer a good deal, that extra traffic? Or has it been more neutral or net negative in terms of volume, just isolating volume? Thank you. Morgan Stanley : I appreciate that. Just last as a follow-up and I know you won't be able to pinpoint it, but the recall itself has obviously been a very important stimulus for showroom traffic at dealers. And I was wondering if when you analyze that and in discussion with your dealers, do you think that the recall activity has been a net positive to your volume and a chance to kind of reengage and rebuild trust and maybe offer a good deal, that extra traffic? Or has it been more neutral or net negative in terms of volume, just isolating volume? Thank you. Chuck Stevens : One specific data point on the program that we offer to the recall, the ignition switch recall population 2.6 million vehicles to-date we\u2019ve sold about 6,600 vehicles under that program so clearly that\u2019s been a benefit for us to build the reengage with some of these customer that had very old products. I would say our dealers are doing an outstanding job dealing with all of these customers that are coming and trying to get their vehicles fixed. We are working with the dealers to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate that our current products are much improved versus some of these older expired architecture vehicles that are being recalled. I think it\u2019s too soon to tell. We need to continue to build that relationship and we\u2019re early in the process. But so far our sales have been resilient. Our loyalty rates seem to be reasonably resilient. And we need to continue to focus on putting the customer at the center and taking care of all these customers they come in that have to have their vehicles repaired. Mary Barra : Yes, and just let me add to that. I mean it really is one interaction at a time and I have to reinforce what Chuck said that the dealers are doing an outstanding job. When you think that as we talked here at the end of first quarter, we really did redouble our effort and really went back it into the late 1990s specifically as it related to some of the safety assistance related to ignition switches to make sure we were doing the right thing. And our dealers have truly responded and we do see this and I\u2019ve talked to dealers Alan has clearly talked to dealers. And to make sure that we see this as an opportunity to demonstrate the trends of those products that we have available today and the customer the way that we\u2019re focused on the customer and the way that we want to make sure their experience goes well as they go through this process. And it\u2019s a partnership but it\u2019s one at a time, and we still have a lot to go as we look to second quarter or second half of the year so that will be a huge focus. Adam Jonas : Thanks for that Mary, thanks Chuck. Morgan Stanley : Thanks for that Mary, thanks Chuck. Chuck Stevens : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And Ms. Mary Barra, I will turn the presentation back to you for your closing remarks. Thank you. Mary Barra : Thank you operator and I want to start off by saying I really do appreciate the opportunity for both Chuck and I to answer your questions. As we go forward here I think we started the conversation by talking about the fact that General Motors, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated resiliency as we\u2019ve gone through this. And I think we\u2019d all agree it\u2019s an important quality in today\u2019s business environment but I want to make it clear that we and the senior leadership and the team at General Motors, we understand that we have a lot more work to do and we\u2019re focused on it. We are working hard to be one of the very best companies in this industry and we feel and are committed to treating the customer right and making sure they stay at the center of everything we do because that\u2019s a long term objective that happens as I said one interaction at a time but we believe it\u2019s key to winning in this business. It isn\u2019t a new strategy for us it\u2019s we rolled out a couple of years ago our core values and the customer being the first and the importance of relationships and then excellence. And we've been consistent as we\u2019ve dealt with the issues that we faced in the first half of this year of staying sure to those core values. And I think it that in terms of purpose that has helped us to be able to stay on plan and drive our operating performance during the first two quarters. I would also say it underpins everything we\u2019re doing as it relates to product design, the way we engineer vehicles in our power trains, supplier quality, our manufacturing operations and sales and service. To demonstrate that I think if you look at the work that team lead out of the product integrity organization or the way Jeff Boyer is leading the global safety team the work that Alicia is driving in the global quality and the customer experience, those are all concrete examples of us demonstrating our commitment there. So everyone is aligned and I believe we still have a lot that we can do to really unleash the full power of GM and what we can do to make sure we\u2019re putting the customer in the center of everything we do. As we move forward we\u2019re going to keep this discipline and focus as we repair all the recalled vehicles and also execute a number of other initiatives in the second half of the year. And then if you look and we just kind of quickly go around the globe here. In China, for example, we have launches of the new Chevrolet Cruze the Buick Envision which will be Buick\u2019s third SUV. In Europe, we talked about the strength of the product there and we\u2019re going to be launching the second generation of the Opel Vivaro van and the fifth generation Opel Corsa. And that vehicle has gotten I think very strong reviews. And these are among what we\u2019ve talked about the 27 new Opel models coming between \u201914 and \u201918. In North America, I am very excited because I think there is a huge opportunity with the Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon. These trucks make us the only OEM that does have a full line with mid-size light duty and heavy duty pickup. And we believe this is a huge opportunity to help us grow and conquest. Specifically in California which is the largest market in the United States for mid-size trucks. We also will have another market share opportunity in the U.S. when we launched the Chevy Trax early next year. And I think the Trax is a great example of the way we\u2019re leveraging our global products in global scale to grow in key markets including the United States, Brazil and China, whereas already on sale of the Trax is proving to be ahead and is doing very well. In China, it\u2019s already the vehicle is number one in the market and it has only been on sale there for three months and year-to-date deliveries have passed 11,500 units in June. So those are just a few of the products that kind of reinforce the conversation that we\u2019ve been having throughout this call that are in our pipeline. And I think it\u2019s important to end the call to talk about product because that truly is the life spot of the company and I think it\u2019s one of the strength that we\u2019ve clearly over the last few years demonstrated that we knew how to do great products that are award winning and receive well by our customer around the globe. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. We\u2019re here to build great vehicles and to make sure we\u2019re doing in a way that everyone satisfies their customers but really creates a unique experience and exceeds their expectations. It\u2019s also our goal to do that to make sure and we understand the importance of exceeding customer expectations but more importantly exceeding our owners\u2019 expectations as well. So that\u2019s the commitment coming from me and I\u2019ll say it\u2019s on behalf of our entire leadership team. And we look forward to continuing to demonstrate that as we move forward. So I appreciate the opportunity and I know we\u2019re having opportunity to talk soon. Randy Arickx : Thank you, operator. Operator : Thank you, sir and ma\u2019am. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect. Thank you once again. Have a wonderful day.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, October 23, 2014. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the 1st Page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive VP and CFO. After the presentation portion of the call, we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to answer some questions. Now I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Randy. I want to open today's call by thanking everyone who attended our Global Business Conference just three weeks ago. It was an important meeting because it was our first chance to talk to you about where we are going as a company. Together, we stated our clear purpose to earn customers for life and to become the most valued automaker. We reaffirmed our near-term financial target and we said, we are targeting 9% to 10% on an EBIT adjusted basis, by early next decade. We believe in our capabilities. We have the talent, the technology and the resources to deliver products and experiences that people love. We have huge upside potential in our brands and with GM financial and we expect to deliver significant core operating efficiencies especially in product development and purchasing. In know there is a show me attitude out there and believe me, it's a powerful motivator for me personally and for our team. We understand, we have real work to do and we are on it. We are changing behaviors to truly value every interaction with our customers and to build much strong relationships with our suppliers, our dealers and our other stakeholders across all of General Motors. This kind of change happens person-to-person one day at a time, but it is beginning to happen. Our journey continues from a solid base. As you can see on Slide 2, we delivered 2.4 million units in the quarter up slightly from a year ago. In the United States, sales increased 8% in the third quarter compared to a year ago. Sales in China, our largest market were up 14% looking at market share, our global share was 11.5% and we earned 17.3% of the market in the United States and 15.2% in China. On a revenue basis, we improve nearly $300 million thanks to improvements in North America and GM Financial, which offsets the clients and markets like Russia and Brazil, where the entire industry is facing headwind. Turning to the bottom line, net income to common stockholders was $1.4 million or $0.81 per diluted share which includes a net loss from special items of $300 million or $0.16 per share. Looking at net cash, net cash from our automotive operations activities was $700 million compared with $3.3 billion in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by one extra regularly scheduled payment to suppliers in the quarter compared to a year ago and cash payments to suppliers and dealers to pay for recall, repairs. Next, let's look at non-GAAP results. On an EBIT adjusted basis, GM earned $3.2 billion which is in line with our expectation. As you can see on the chart North America earned $2.5 billion in EBIT adjusted which is up about $300 million from a year ago. Europe continues to show operational improvements despite the headwinds in Russia. Losses increased due to incremental restricting expense that overall results were ahead of expectation and GM South America, we essentially breakeven despite the difficult macroeconomic environment in Brazil and Argentina and the ongoing challenges in Venezuela. In China, we earned an equity income of $500 million from our joint ventures, which is up 14% from a year ago. At GMIO including china and all other markets and at GM Financial results were about equal from a year ago. Finally our adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $800 million compared with $1.3 billion a year ago. Chuck Stevens will provide additional details in all of this in just a few minutes. If you turn now to Slide 3, we have summarized some of our key accomplishments from the quarter. They are organized around the 2016 financial targets and strategic opportunities that we presented at the Global Business Conference. So it is clear to see, how accomplishments are driving the business forward. Starting in North America, we had an outstanding record with record 80 ps in an EBIT adjusted margin of 9.5%, that's an improvement an 0.2% compared with a year ago and it marks our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. Our performance was well balanced across different vehicle segment, but it was especially strong in pickups and SUV. For example, our retail share of the large SUV segment is about 80% through the first nine months of the year. Also GM estimated share of the retail market for large pickups has now increased sequentially for three quarters in a row. We expect to believe in more truck momentum as availability of the Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon growth during the fourth quarter. We are very excited about these launches. The trucks are getting great reviews in the press and to meet expected demand, we've already announced plans for third production shift at our Winfield, Missouri plant. We expect it to come online in March. Sales of smaller vehicles have also been strong. In fact our compact cars are having their best sales year since 2005 and the new Buick Encore small crossover has been the best-selling vehicle in its segment for six months in a row, through September. Looking next at China, we had record sales in the third quarter and during the first nine months of the year. Our margins continue to remain strong at 9.6%. Our market share in the quarter 15.2%, up 0.8% of a point from a year ago. For the year, we are up 0.2% to 14.7% on the strength of new products at all of our brands, especially Chevrolet and Cadillac. We also passed a major milestone in September. 20 million cumulative vehicle sales. As we said at the Global Business Conference, we aim to grow faster than the market overtime. Our China joint venture are planning to invest significant from 2014 through 2018 to open five new manufacturing plant, this will give us the ability to support sales of just under 5 million vehicles annually. During the third quarter, we added capacity for 300,000 vehicles and 450,000 engines. In Europe, we made several strategic moves during the quarter which we expect will help us return to profitability in 2016. The better managed through the difficult market in Russia and position ourselves with future success. We have strengthened our leadership team. We are speeding up supplier localization at our St. Petersburg plant and we have adjusted manpower. In Spain, we began building the Opel Mokka at our Zaragoza plant, which we believe will help us meet market demand and improved profitability. At the Paris Auto show we unveiled four new products and powertrains, that we expect will drive revenue and share growth. The biggest reveal was the fifth-generation Opel Corsa. It's the car first major redesign in 8 years and we are expecting an improvement of variable profit of about $900 per unit. The new Astra which will follow next year is expected to deliver an even larger variable profit improvement of about $1,250 per unit together these models will represent about half of Opel/Vauxhall's volume. Turning to Slide 4, let's next talk about Cadillac, where we have a new leadership team led by Johann Denison that lives and breathes, the luxury business and is prepared to make bold moves to accelerate the brands global growth. The opportunity is enormous, the global luxury segment is expected to grow by 36% by 2020. In September, Johann, Dan [ph], [indiscernible] and I met with our Cadillac dealers and shared the framework of a plan to elevate the brand, so it's value in the market place matches the strength of its award winning new vehicle. This includes investing in every customer touch point and expanding Cadillac portfolio with vehicles like the ATS Coupe, the ATS-L in China and the CT6, which will be the most technologically advanced Cadillac every built. One of the CT6's most important innovations will be the new lightweight body construction technique that helps reduce fuel consumption and enhances driving dynamic and improved safety. It's an important statement about our intent to lead the industry and technology and innovation, but it's not the only one. For example, this quarter we launched Powermat wireless smartphone charging in the Cadillac ATS Coupe and we continue to rollout 4G, LTE and high speed mobile broadband across our brands in the United States. We also announced that in 2017, the Cadillac CTS will be GM's first car and we believe the first in North America, with vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity, which can help mitigate or avoid up to 80% of crashes involving unimpaired drivers. We also confirmed that Cadillac will introduce a technology call Super Cruise in that same timeframe. This feature will allow drivers to safely travel highway without touching the steering wheel or the pedals for extended periods in both stop and go traffic and at speed. This is just a glimpse of how we will use technology to make driving more fun, safer and more convenient. There is a lot more coming. Another piece of good news came when the S&P upgraded GM and GM Financial investment grade status on the strength of our fortress balance sheet, our cash flow and our operating performance. The biggest impact of the upgrade will be filed at GM Financial, which will be able to raise capital at a lower cost that in turn will help us sell more vehicles and build customer loyalty. Before I turn the call over to Chuck. I'd like to give you a quick recall update. As we have discussed before, we have worked very closely with our suppliers to accelerate the production and the shipment of repair part for the vehicles we have recalled this year and our dealers have done an exceptional job of fixing vehicles as quickly as possible. With respect specifically to the ignition switch recall that we announced in the spring, our dealers have repaired more than 1.2 million vehicles which is more than half of the population still on the road. We now have a parts and kits available to repair all of the impacted vehicles. So we are stepping up our proactive outreach to customers, who have not yet brought their vehicles in for a repair. Finally, the GM ignition claims resolution facility, which is been administered by Ken Feinberg began accepting claims on August 1, and will continue to accept claims until December 31. Let's now move to a more detailed review of the quarter with Chuck Stevens then we will take your questions. Chuck? Chuck Stevens : Thanks, Mary. Now on Slide 5, I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was $39.3 billion compared to $39 billion in the prior year period. The $300 million increase includes an unfavorable $800 million associated with 93,000 lower wholesale volumes and an unfavorable $300 million primarily related to foreign exchange translation in South America and North America. These factors were partially offset by $600 million favorable impact from net pricing primarily in North America. Favorable mix of $400 million across several regions and $400 million of [indiscernible] GM Financial. Net income to common stockholders was $1.4 billion for the quarter and nearly $700 million from the prior year. This was driven primarily by the absence of the $800 million reduction from the redemption of, a portion of series A preferred shares during the third quarter of 2013. Partially offset by $300 million in special charges this quarter, which I will cover later. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.81 and our automotive net cash from operating activities was $700 million, down $2.5 billion on a rounded basis compared to 2013. The decrease was driven by one extra weekly payment cycle to suppliers in this quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago and cash payments related to repairing, recalled vehicles including cost to expedite parts to dealers. For our non-GAAP measures EBIT adjusted was $2.3 billion in the third quarter and EBIT adjusted margin declined to 5.8%. the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to incremental restructuring expenses in Europe, incremental recall related expense and unfavorable foreign exchange. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was a negative $800 million to the third quarter. a decrease of $2.2 billion on a rounded basis. The decrease was driven primarily by one extra regularly scheduled payment to supplier in the quarter compared to a year ago and cash payments to suppliers and dealers to pay for recall, repairs. For the first nine months of the year, we generated $1.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow despite the higher recall related calls on cash. This would equate to about $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the first nine months excluding recall related cash payments. Slide 6, lists the special items for the quarter. Again net income to common stockholders was $1.4 billion and a fully diluted earnings per share was $0.81. net income was reduced $100 million related to flood damage sustained at our technical center in Warren, Michigan and $200 million of assets impairments related to our Russian subsidiaries. These charges had a $0.16 unfavorable impact on diluted earnings per share. On Slide 7, we show our consolidated EBIT adjusted for the prior five periods. At the bottom of the slide, we list the revenue, wholesale volumes and margins for the same periods. Our EBIT adjusted was $2.3 billion and our EBIT adjusted margin was 5.8% for the quarter, down 1 percentage point from the prior year period. This include $200 million on incremental recall related expense. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were $1.5 million in the third quarter 6% decrease from the prior year. Primarily attributable to challenging market conditions in South America and GM International operations and our global market share decreased 0.10 percentage point to 11.5%. Turning to Slide 8, we explain $400 million year-over-year decrease in our consolidated EBIT adjusted. As I just covered global wholesales were down in total. However, the EBIT adjusted impact increased wholesales in North America, offset the impact of lower wholesales in the rest of regions. Mix was also flat compared to the prior year. Price was $600 million favorable primarily due to recently launched vehicles in North America like the new full size SUVs. Full size trucks in the Middle East and price actions to offset foreign exchange and inflation impacts in South America. Costs was $800 million unfavorable primarily due to $700 million in material cost associated with recently launched products. Incremental restricting expense of $100 million, recall related expense of $200 million. Partially offset by $200 million in material cost performance. Other was $100 million unfavorable primarily related to $200 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset with $100 million of incremental equity income. Slide 9 gives our year-over-year EBIT adjusted performance by segment. GM North America increased to $300 million to $2.5 billion including approximately $100 million of incremental recall expense. GM Europe decreased $100 million on a rounded basis driven by higher restructuring expense. GM International Operations was flat compared to the prior year period as China growth was offset by challenging conditions and consolidated operations. The South American segment essentially broke even despite an increasingly challenging macro environment. GM Financial recorded $200 million in adjusted earnings before taxes, flat year-over-year. Our corporate sector was $200 million loss, including recall related legal expenses of approximately $100 million. I will now review the key performance indicators for North America on Slide 10. For the third quarter of 2014, our total US market share was 17.3% and our retail share was 15.5%. The success of our recently launched full size SUV's have driven retail share in the segment to 78% year-to-date, a 9 percentage point improvement and a nearly 15 percentage point increase in a share with a large luxury SUV segment. Our incentives for the quarter were 11.4% of average transaction price, which put us at 110% of the industry average. This compares to incentives as 10.9% of average transaction prize and 114% of the industry average in the prior year period. The incentive growth was far less than our domestic competitors and less in the overall industry. Average transactions prices at all-time high for GM in the month of September. Slide 11 shows, GM North America's EBIT adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide. At the bottom of the slide, revenue increased $2.3 billion to $25.8 billion driven by a wholesale volume increase of 59,000 units and strong pricing. North America's EBIT adjusted margin was 9.5% for the third quarter. this represent the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential year-over-year improvement and EBIT adjusted margins excluding recalls. Our US dealer inventory increased to 754,000 vehicles up from a year ago, but down about 45,000 units from the second quarter. This is equivalent of 81-day supply and at the end of the September one day less than the prior year period. GMNA wholesale vehicle sales were 834,000 units, 59,000 units higher than the prior year. North American market share was 16.8% in the quarter which was at the 0.10 percentage point increase from the prior year period. The primary drives of $300,000 million increase in North America's EBIT adjusted are on Slide 12. Volume was $500 million favorable due to an increase of 59,000 units in wholesale vehicle sales driven primarily by full size pickups and full size SUVs. Mix was a $100 million unfavorable primarily due to country mix. As a large proportion of sales were attributable to Canada and Mexico this quarter compared to the prior year. Price was $400 million favorable as the $800 million in favorable pricing from our recently launched vehicles was partially offset by $400 million in unfavorable pricing from our carryover products. There were no materials incentive stock adjustments or related impacts in price this quarter. cost was $700 million unfavorable primarily due to $600 million in increased material cost associated with recently launched products and $100 million of other. Primarily due to incremental recall related cost including higher freight expense as we expedited shipping of recall replacement parts. This was partially offset with $100 million in material cost performance associated with carryover products. Other was $100 million favorable due to foreign exchange. Turning to Slide 13, Europe reporting EBIT adjusted loss of $400 million for the quarter on a rounded basis $100 million increase from the prior year. Revenue decreased to $5.2 billion for the quarter primarily due to lower volume in foreign exchange primarily driven by Russia. Europe's wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter decreased 14,000 units to 273,000 units. Opel/Vauxhall sales were up about 4%, which was more than offset by lower sales in Russia. European market share decreased to 6.5% as we wind down the Chevrolet brand and deal with market declines in Russia. However, Opel/Vauxhall brand experienced market share increases in 12 countries on a year-over-year basis. On Slide 14, we provide the major components of Europe's $100 million decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was flat. Mix was a $100 million favorable driven primarily by the Opel Mokka. Price was flat. Cost was $100 million unfavorable driven by $200 million in incremental restructuring expense partially offset by $100 million in material cost performance on carryover products. Other was a $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange. Primarily the Russia Ruble against the US Dollar. We now move on to GMIO's profitability for the prior five quarters on Slide 15. EBIT adjusted was $300 million including $500 million in equity income from our joint ventures. At the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from consolidated operations was $3.7 billion. So $1.1 billion decline from the third quarter of 2013, is primarily due to lower wholesale vehicle sales of 74,000 units associated with the line down of the Chevrolet brand in Europe and lower volume in [indiscernible] in India. The net income margin from our China JV's came in strong at 9.6%. GMIO had wholesale vehicle sales of 159,000 for its' consolidated operations and 868,000 for the China JV's. year market share improvement to 10.4% driven entirely by share growth in China, which finish Q3 at 15.2% share. And Slide 16, we provide the major components of GMIO's year-over-year performance. Volume was $300 million unfavorable driven by reduced wholesale vehicle sales and our consolidated operations. Mix was $100 million favorable, primarily attributable to lower proportion of Chevrolet Europe sales. Price was $100 million favorable due to full size SUV's and full size pickups in the Middle East and cost was essentially flat year-over-year. Other was $100 million favorable driven by increased equity income in China. Slide 17 provides a look at GM South America's performance in recent quarters. Despite of very challenging environment South America, we have delivered sequential improvements in EBIT adjusted as the year has progressed and we expected this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. at the bottom of the page, revenue decreased $1.2 billion year-over-year to $3.2 billion. This is due to $900 million in lower wholesale volumes primarily in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina as well as $300 million unfavorable impact primarily from foreign exchange. GM South America's wholesale vehicle sales were 218,000 units and 64,000 unit decreased from the prior year period and our market share in the region declined to 16.4%. On Slide 18, we will look at the drivers of the $300 million decrease in EBIT adjusted. Volume was $200 million unfavorable driven by 64,000 lower wholesale volumes. Mix was $100 million unfavorable due primarily to lower sales in Venezuela. Price was $100 million favorable due to actions we have taken in Argentina to partially offset inflationary and foreign exchange pressures. Cost was $100 million favorable and other was $200 million headwind due to foreign exchange in Argentina and Venezuela. This totals to essentially breakeven EBIT adjusted in South America in the third quarter. Slide 19 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the third quarter. From our net income to common of $1.4 billion. We add back the impact of non-controlling interest in preferred dividend and then deduct GM Financial earnings to arrive at an automotive income of $1.3 billion. We had $300 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization was $1.4 billion. Working capital was $2.7 billion use of cash driven primarily by an extra weekly payment cycle to suppliers, during the quarter compared to the prior year period along with increased inventory related to rental cars. Pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $300 million in the quarter. other was an $800 million source of cash. A $200 million increase from the prior year. Primarily driven by an increase in joint venture dividends partially offset by deferred income taxes. This totals automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $700 million, which also included approximately $700 million in recall related cash payments associated with large accruals, we made earlier this year. We expect similar levels of recall related cash payments in the fourth quarter with the remainder of the recall related cash payments following into 2015. We have $1.6 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of negative $800 million. We expect adjusted automotive free cash flow to be positive in the fourth quarter as much as negativity in the quarter was due to timing of working capital components. Our liquidity position on Slide 20 decreased to $36.6 billion including $26.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Debt increased to $7.3 billion and we continue to $3.1 billion in Series A preferred stock. As we look at rolled forward of our pensions plans primarily including updates to service cost, payments and foreign exchange. The US qualified and non-qualified pension plans ended the quarter underfunded by $6.8 billion. Our non-US pensions were underfunded by $11.5 billion and our unfunded OPEB liability remain flat at $6.2 billion. Slide 21 provides a brief summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial release their results this morning and will hold their earnings conference call at noon. Our US Subprime penetration in the third quarter declined 0.2 percentage points to 7.6%. Our US lease penetration increased to 22.3% in the third quarter, which is just a few point below industry average. Lease penetration in Canada improved 7.8 percentage points to 15.9%. GM is a percentage of GM Financial loan and lease originations rose to 74% and GM Financial percentage of GM's US consumer Subprime financing and leasing was 33% in the quarter. GM Financials annualized net credit losses remained consistent at 2% and their adjusted earnings before tax were $205 million for the third quarter. Currently on Slide 22, we reiterate our focuses we begin to close off the year. We need to continue to execute our recent and upcoming launches and this includes ramping up, availability of our all-important midsized trucks here in North America. We will continue to drive improved core operating performance across the regions as we execute action plans to address challenging environments in places like South America and Russia. We are confident, we are currently on or ahead of the plan to deliver the results, we promised earlier this year excluding the effects of recalls. We continue to believe that second half EBIT adjusted and EBIT margins will be higher in the first half of the year excluding recalls. The first half EBIT adjusted and margins were $4.3 billion and 5.6% respectively excluding recalls and in Q3, we delivered another $2.5 billion EBIT adjusted and margins of 6.4% excluding incremental recall related expenses. Our third quarter results, further validates that we are consistently delivering on our plans. Now Mary and I will take your questions, after which Mary will have some closing remarks. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen (Operator Instructions) our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Couple things, one is I was hoping you might be able to just talk a little bit about within North America, the price and mix versus the contribution cost, if you had it all together for new products and carryover. It's about negative $200 million and you did mention that your investor meeting that you're expecting that to get better going forward. I think partly on some moderation of carryover pricing and partly on cost. Can you just give us a sense of when we would start to see that some of the major drivers of that improvement going forward? Chuck Stevens : Yes, sure, Rod. As we indicated back on October 1, when we looked into 2015 and beyond. We expect to accelerate material performance on carryover. Generally in the range of $800 million to $900 million of performance next year, which would be up $300 million or $400 million on a year-over-year basis and as we cycle through especially on a year-over-year compare, the incentive increases in full size pickups. We will expect that to moderate as well next year driven by a number of factors as we mentioned competitive launches at a couple of our competitors. So those will be the big drivers. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  So early next year, you would expect to see some moderation? Chuck Stevens : That's our expectation to see it through the year, as we indicated on October 1, yes. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Okay, and I noticed in the J.D. Power PIN data that there was something of an uptick in incentive spending in large pickup trucks recently like September and October. Is that just sort of tactical moves or is there some deterioration happening there and then, I was hoping you can also maybe touch on just China kind of broadly. Obviously there is been some slowdown broadly in that market. Some players are suggesting that inventories have risen and obviously that some capacity growth. You know what's any update on the outlook for that region? Chuck Stevens : Yes, talking about the talking centers first and overall incentives for us in September were up versus where we've been running in July and August and as you noted, it was very much a tactical move. We wanted to start and aggressively sell down, model year '14 to make room for model year '15. If you look at overall Q3, our increase was below our domestic competition, Q3 versus Q2 and generally in line with the industry and on a calendar year-to-date basis. We are generally in line with spending levels as a percent of transaction price versus last year. So in no way a departure from incentives, discipline and aligning supply and demand that was very much a tactical move in the month September. I would expect incentive spending to moderate and come down as we go through the fourth quarter. relative to china, growth has slowed in the last couple of months, but year-to-date still up between 9% and 10% in a year-over-year basis. We are still expecting something just short of 10% industry growth to somewhere around $24 million versus just over $22 million in 2013 and would expect to see that kind of level of growth may be somewhat muted going into 2015 as well. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, thank you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Proceed with your question. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital : Sure. A couple questions, sort of housekeeping in North America then sort of Russia and helping us understand what part of Russia is in GMIO versus Europe. In North America, your wholesales seem to match your retails roughly year-over-year, but if we look at sequentially. You had they weren't kind of in line, can you kind of maybe go back and recap for us and kind of wholesale retail, mismatch. Last quarter versus this quarter then how to think about going forward? Chuck Stevens : Yes on that specific question, Brian. We will get back to you on those details between second quarter and third quarter retails versus wholesales. Remember, you start with production, imports and we imported a fair few units less exports and then we end up with factory units sales and we adjust for whatever happens from a daily rental perspective, whether we are buying \u2013 since I would suggest that taking wholesales in the movement in dealer inventory should roughly triangulate with the changes in deliveries, but we can provide that that detail to you later. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, second question on North America. I think in the past you said that, same thing about North American margin that you said about Global EBIT margin that will improve second half over first half recalls. Is that still out there or is that just because their winnings [ph] in the end of the back year. Chuck Stevens : Yes, I would suggest that EBIT margins in North America are going to be higher in the second half than they were in the first half, they'll be higher in the second half versus the second half last year will be higher in the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter last year. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Okay and then finally, could you provide some more color on Russia. What was the headwind in 3Q, maybe where does it show up between GME and the wind-down of Chevy in GMIO's, is there any intra-region we got to be aware of there? And then how should we think about that going forward both the currency effect which might just show up in a special item and then just ongoing pressures there. Chuck Stevens : First all of the Russia results are reported in GM Europe Chevrolet, Europe which is Western Europe results are reported in International Operation. So again, all of Russia is within the GM Europe segment. When you think about Russia on a go forward basis, I think you need to size the operation. You know, we are selling today roughly 125,000 units to 130,000 units significantly down year-over-year because of the industry. Locally, we have about a quarter of $1 billion in country over the local fix costs. So when I think about where the challenge is or where the headwinds could materialize on a go forward basis clearly, it would be in foreign exchange depending on what happened with the Ruble and our ability to go price for that and offset it. Number two, would be in volumes and how much further does the industry drop on a go forward basis, but I think the key message is overall exposure, overall magnitude of the business in Russia compared to the rest of GM Europe is relatively small. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Okay and your PP&E base is fully depreciated yet and if you were to market it down duty to business prospect for currency or both. I assume, that would be a special item. Chuck Stevens : We impaired the Russian assets in the third quarter $200 million charge as a special item. Brian Johnson \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Okay, thanks. Operator : : John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, just a first question on average transaction prices which are running better than I think most people unexpected despite the fears. One of the big supports is that, 3-year to 4 year old residuals are running about 5% higher than normal for the industry. I'm just curious if you can comment on where GM's 3-year to 4-year old residuals are running relative to current pricing and just trying to understand that versus where the industry stands right now because of big support for price [ph]. Chuck Stevens : Just broad strokes John. Our residuals generally compared to where the industries out in US, we have a gap of roughly 200 basis points to the industry on average across our portfolio. So you could apply, whatever numbers you have for the industry and were about 200 basis points less than on average from a residual perspective. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And you'd expect that gap to close as new products are launched over the next 1 years or 3 years. Chuck Stevens : And as I've talked about before, in my former role that's one of the key initiatives that we have on a go forward basis, was to close that residual gap and if you size up that opportunity from a business model average improving the overall output of the business, that's $150 million to $200 million opportunity. Especially it manifests itself from a lease perspective and lower lease cost. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  That's very helpful, then a second question as we look at Slide 19 and the working capital ahead of $2.7 billion. I know you guys are setting this extra week of payments to suppliers, is that really basically $2.6 billion trucks or is it that, you know a little bit less than that? I'm just trying to understand the magnitude. Chuck Stevens : Yes, broad strokes that extra payment is worth about $2 billion and then there inventory impact that makes up the rest and a big portion of that inventory impact is the timing of rental repurchase, we buy them back and we didn't send them to the auction in Q3 and frankly, a certain part of that delay was, we had to hold until they were repaired because of recall issues. So I would expect to see that unwind not necessarily all in Q4, will be opportunistic depending on used car values typically better in Q1 and Q4, but I would expect that to unwind over the next six months or so. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  And working capital should unwind in the fourth quarter? Chuck Stevens : A good portion of that supplier payment, that extra payment should unwind. So started $2 billion and that will be driven largely by the level of production, that we have on a comparable basis, but certainly we'd expect a good portion of that to unwind in the fourth quarter, yes. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay and then on the European comments, is very much focused on profitability in 2016, the bulk of them is going to be closed at the end of this year and it sounds like, the Corsa and Astra launches will be fairly helpful next year. I'm just curious, if you could talk about sort of interim step in 2015 because that would be a breakeven year, in Europe just based on the cost saves and the product launches. Chuck Stevens : I would only go this far and you'll stay tuned for January, but we would expect to see significant improvement year-over-year in Europe versus this year. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay and then just lastly, it looks like you guys brought back about $168 million box worth of shares in the quarter, what was that? I mean, I thought we won't look at any share buybacks here, but it looks like you executed share buybacks in the quarter. Chuck Stevens : Yes, this is just any dilutive share buyback related to our incentive compensation program. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay, but do you have the ability to buy back shares, if so desired into offset options? Chuck Stevens : That's fundamentally what we did in the quarter, yes. For what we intended to do is make sure that our incentive compensation program did not dilute shares. Yes, we don't have options by the way. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Okay, got you. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS:  Any upside on the restricting cost for the year? I think in starting the year you said, it would be about $1.1 billion, there's only $700,000 year-to-date. Does that imply a big hit in Q4? Is that number likely going to come in lower? Chuck Stevens :  I would expect overall restructuring expenses to come in somewhat less than $1.1 billion, but I would also suggest that Q4, will be slightly higher than Q3 from a restructuring perspective two drivers to that Colin. Number one, Europe will be down slightly quarter-to-quarter, but we are also now starting to ramp up the restructuring costs associated with the Australian manufacturing. So you know the combination of those two, a little bit lower in Europe higher and IO, the net result will be slightly higher restructuring cost in Q4 versus Q3, but overall I think we are going to be end up closer to a $1 billion, then we will $1.1 billion, when we get all set and done. You know a lot of that dependent upon the timing of employee acceptances of separation program etc., but that's our best thinking at this point. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS:  And you know, looking at GMIO ex-China. It looks like, it continue to decline about another $100 million, is there any restructuring plans there. I assume this year there was going to be some action, given the changes to the Chevy Europe strategy. Is there anything we should be anticipating coming down the line there to get that those probable [ph] losses to turn around. Chuck Stevens : Yes, we continue to execute a number of plans. I just mentioned, the Australia manufacturing that's is going to be one big driver over time that will drive improved performance. There is been a number of actions taken by Stefan Jacoby and his team and all of the markets there to an improve the results and rate size, the business model. And in fact, we are ahead of our plan there from restructuring their performance perspective and again similar to Europe without providing too much specific guidance on 2015. We would expect to see continued improvement in consolidated operations on a year-over-year basis. A lot of that obviously will be absence of losses associated with Chevrolet Europe, which is also factored into the IO results. Mary Barra : I would just add Chuck, there is two components of that. there is, I'll say shorter term of just driving the efficiencies and make sure, we are managing the business effectively and then there is longer term, making sure we have the right portfolio, understand the customer and are going to market with the white product lineup that will take, have a little longer horizon. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS:  Okay and just one last question, tax rate was pretty low in the quarter. how should we be thinking about that going forward for the full year? Chuck Stevens : Yes, for the full year I would say low 20% range. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: Obviously a lot of moving pieces in Europe these days, you know some better sale and share in Western Europe sharply lower sales in share in Western European sharply lower sales in share in Russian that currencies, sanctions, plant closure, Chevrolet exist as that stuff. So I'm wondering, is there anything you can tell us about the profitability of your underlying core Opel/Vauxhall operations, outside of Russia, outside of [indiscernible], so that we can better gage the progress of your underlying continue to [indiscernible]. Chuck Stevens : Okay, so broad strokes. We lost overall Europe $300 million in the first quarter, $300 million in the second quarter, $400 million in the third quarter. the restructuring in each of those was roughly $200 million. Yes the core overall European operation about $100 million loss in the first quarter, the second quarter; $200 million in the third quarter. A chunk of that really was related to the Porsche ramp down in the course of launch. So the core European business was running close to $100 million loss and that includes a fairly significant year-over-year headwind from Russia. So my takeaway and the way, I think about it Ryan is, the core operation in Opel/Vauxhall performed reasonably well. If you strip out the restructuring and factor in some of the headwinds we were facing from Russia. Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, great and that housekeeping item on North America, Chuck you said you called that some higher trade expense related to the recall parts. Can you quantify that, it does sounds like there's $100 million non-material cost cut out, is all of that freight, that would be 40 bps? Chuck Stevens : Yes, no. all in on around about $100 million of incremental recalls related expenses, significant portion of it, is premium freight and just expediting the shipment of recall parts as you know, not only the ignition switch but other recalls we get, 25 plus million vehicles we are trying to repair and take care of the customers as expeditiously as possible. We are also doing significant outreach to a number of these customers above and beyond, what we have done in the past to try to encourage them, to bring their cars in and get them repaired, which is a factor and overall from a warranty adjustment perspective, there were adjustments and warranty but nothing material. Taken all together, it kind of adds to on around $100 million or so. Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: So I guess, what I'm hearing is that, full year adjusted for recall, you ran at 9.9% in the third quarter, which is typically a softer quarter relative to your 2016, well 10 points to zero [ph]. Chuck Stevens : I would say that, your map is correct and the third quarter ex, the impact of recalls, we ran it about 9.9%. Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, great. Then just complete last question, on the breakeven results in South America, probably the biggest price today, I would say, if you will get a tend bit [ph] sideboard it doesn't look like you're taking much restructuring down there. You talked about [indiscernible], but nothing that rounds, that doesn't round down to zero. So if it's not restructuring and is a product cadence, which is of course a good thing, but that maybe it means, it's little bit more cyclical as oppose to restructuring. Can you just tell us about sources and sustainability of those better results? Thanks. Chuck Stevens : Yes, I think what you're fundamentally seeing is the impact on the cost structure of all the actions that we've been taking over the last two years. so this just wasn't a one-time time, starting back in late 2011, 2012. We have been consistently driving improved localization, material performance, logistic savings. We've been working on manufacturing efficiency including plant closures and other actions, a more economic labor agreement, three year labor agreement at lower than industry average economies for instance and what we are seeing is, the impact of much lower cost structure and our ability to deal with the volatility in the market. So it's a one initiative thing, it's a combination of everything that team is been executing over the last number of years. Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: Great, thanks for the color. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Couple of questions for Mary. Mary at Ford Motor company's recent capital market stay, a couple of days before yours. They show the slide called automotive industry trends and one of the slides, part of the slide included technologies that would have disruptive impact on the business model of automakers. At the top of list was new mobility and car sharing. I would love to hear your views on how GM views the threat or opportunity of car sharing and ride sharing, things like business model like Uber Lyft and you know guys have really arrived on your business in what you're doing and how much of a focus that is? Mary Barra : Well, Adam. We \u2013 as I said at the Global Business Conference we think, there is going to be more change in the next 5 years to 10 years than there has been in the last 50 years, with a lot of different aspects. As it relates to technology, consumer preferences, what is happening from an environmental perspective, from a regulatory perspective and but we are not announcing specific things. We are working in all those areas because, they drive change, but they also drive opportunity and to strengthen the business. The end of the day, there is going to be a point where people still need to get from point A to point B and well, we want to participate strongly in that, in a number of different models because I don't think it will be the same across the globe. So we are working on a number different initiatives specifically to talk, what we deem our call Urban Mobility and so we do see those changes coming and we see them as opportunities. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Great and then just final question, Mary. A lot of the topics and goals of your business conference through 2016 and of course beyond through the architecture consolidation period, well in the next decade involved a very large dependence on China, on Cadillac, on your global architecture. Which would of course imaging involve your most important strategic partner Shanghai Auto.? I guess a question is, as you get more intertwined with Shanghai Auto or SAIC. Is the current structure enough to kind of handle and nurture that co-dependency that you have, you're obviously hugely important to them, they're important to you, but as you kind of become more and more co-dependent not less. Is there an opportunity or is there a discussions to take that, to kind of more formalized that perhaps you will say a strategic alliance or cross shareholding or something more or is the current structure satisfactory to you? Thank you. Mary Barra : You know I would say the current structure is satisfactory, I think what's more important than even the structure though is the strength that we have in the partnership, the respect, how well we work together, how we look at the business and are driving it and looking at opportunities across the market place. You know we have complete alignment and the importance of the three brands that we have from Cadillac, a Buick and a Chevrolet and then come to specific as you look at the Wuling partnership with [indiscernible] and the Wuling brand and so you know very well set out strategies have looked at the opportunity, Cadillac provides a great opportunity. So again, I think the structure is fine and I think it's the strength of the JV is the way that we work together and look at how the market is going to progress and how we're going to participate in it. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you, Mary. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed with your question. Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi: Just a couple of follow-up questions. To Chuck, back to South America you mentioned, you expect to see continued momentum into the fourth quarter, do you expect you might be profitable in South America in the fourth quarter? Chuck Stevens : What I indicated was continued improvement in the fourth quarter. we lost $32 million specifically in the third quarter, essentially breakeven and I would expect to see that improve and a couple of drivers of that, that's always with the caveat that we see, no further decay from a macro perspective, but based on the work that we have been doing with Venezuelan government. We were able to get currency releases back in the second quarter, not a huge amount but enough to enable us to order and produce a low level of vehicles in the fourth quarter and that will all other things being equal, really be the tailwind in Q4 versus Q3 going from essentially zero production to some level of production assuming all works out, so that's the biggest driver. Again with the caveat that, there is no further deterioration from a macro perspective. Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi:  Great and just to clarify, I think you mentioned Chuck in remarks that, you were at or ahead of the original expectations for 2014. Were you specifically referring to the original outlook for total EBIT adjusted to be modestly improved 2014 versus 2013? Chuck Stevens : Yes, I was generally talking about the guidance that we provided back in January and I would base on the performance that we've seen counting year-to-date, we are certainly from an overall company perspective very, very much on plan and in certain areas ahead of plan, up for instance Europe versus what we expect to earlier this year's performing ahead of plan. International operations both China and our consolidated operations and performing a bit ahead of plan, North America is very, very much unplanned and South America you know clearly is not performing as we expected given the macro conditions and as we look through the fourth quarter, if we achieve our objectives and what we expect to in the fourth quarter. I think that, at the end of the day we are going to be very much on or potentially ahead of that plan. Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi:  That's very helpful, Chuck and then just lastly, CapEx in the quarter looked a little bit light I think you're running lower than $7 billion to $8 billion. Any thoughts there and expectations into the fourth quarter? how we should think about just CapEx going forward here? Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi:  You know that's cash CapEx not accrual CapEx, so a lot of that has to do with, when you make the commitments in that and you know depending on the milestone. So on a year-over-year basis, last year we were $1.9 billion in the third quarter and cash CapEx, this year $1.6 billion. I would expect the cash CapEx to go up in the fourth quarter. You can almost look at the cash CapEx to be at or slightly delay from when you actually launch the products because you go through PPAP and all the milestones and once everything is running, you know we start to pay the supplier. So I would expect, as we indicated earlier to spend in $7.5 billion range this year and I would expect Q4, cash CapEx to go up versus Q3. Itay Michaeli \u2013 Citi:  Terrific, that's very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Daniel [indiscernible] with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for the additional disclosure on majors versus carryover pricing. In North America is there any way you can give us a rough estimate of what percentage of shipments were new products versus carryover in the quarter? Chuck Stevens : We can get that information for you, but I don't have it off the top of my head. I mean, when you think about the new products that we are selling right now, that would be part of that calculation. Full sized SUV's, heavy duty pickup trucks, to the extent that we sold midsized pickup trucks in the quarter. So I would think, that would be a relatively low percentage of our overall sales that obviously very big impact, when you think about the price impact on full sized SUV's and heavy duty pickups. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, got it and what products, if you can go into any detail or driving the negative pricing on a year-over-year basis on the carryover? Chuck Stevens : You know largely, full sized pickups and again as you launch through last year launch cadence, we were in the third quarter last year, we were still in our launch cadence as we started in April with Ford Lane with one series of trucks and move through the launch cadence. So I would say, largely that's attributable to full sized pickups, not entirely but at least the majority of that $400 million negative net price is associated with large pickups. Unidentified Analyst : So basically kind of the large pickups that you're selling this year that are GMT 900s versus. Chuck Stevens : No, the new pickups because we cycle out of the launch, right? Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay, I see okay and then just one other question on IO. If you could talk about the trajectory, were on exporting K2XX products into region in Q3 and more on a long-term basis, can you give us an update on, now that Chevy Europe is basically not, you know they're getting no production from Korea anymore, what's the cap utilization situation in Korea and anything you can tell us on plans to address that? Chuck Stevens : Alright, first on the K2, yes we do produce and ship to the Middle East and as we indicated, as we thought about second half and next year of the growth of that and the performance to that, in the Middle East, we thought was going to be a tailwind and it's starting to prove out to be that, we had favorable mix or pricing in the third quarter, associated with the launch of those products and we expect that to continue going forward. Relative to Korea and Chevrolet Europe and we've talked about this before. Clearly, roughly 200,000 units out of the manufacturing build and Korea has created a capacity situation and we're aggressively, inactively working to deal with that overtime. So that's part of the actions that we are taking in international operations to ensure, that we've got the right industrialization and structural on this. The demand capabilities in the region. So Korea certainly an area that we continue to focus and work on. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, appreciated. Thanks. Operator : And our last question today comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Alright, made it under the wire. You know just two last ones from me. Number one is, the impact of well you've seen the Manheim come off a little bit, not dramatically but there has been moderation in used prices. You know can we understand how that impacts you from a leasing perspective and is that strictly kind of GMS thing or is there a lease sharing or residual risk sharing arrangement that impacts North America as well? Chuck Stevens : Okay, first we execute leases today through GM Financial ally in US Bank through partners. There is no residual risk sharing, so the residual exposure stays with the finance company, whether it's GMF ally or US Bank. Clearly depending on industry moves and what happens with our residuals vis-\u00e0-vis the competition the current at the market cost, can manifests themselves primarily in the OEM, as we need to hit competitive payment point. So that gets back to that residual gap that I was talking about before, but I would suggest from a residual risk perspective and I can speak specifically to GM Financial, we monitor that very closely mark-to-market on a quarter-to-quarter we look at the developments in the used car market and where we think those prices are going versus the ALG Automotive Lease Guide, which is how we establish the reserves to start with. So we're at least in our view, are fully reserved in good shape as of Q3 of GM Financial. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Okay that's helpful and then just one last clarification on the, I guess it's Slide 12, GMNA there are indeed a lot of moving pieces here, but just as we kind of think about the make-up of the profit tailwind you're expecting in '15 and ultimately in '16. You know a gave a number of pieces. Clearly there is the cost saves of I guess $400 million year-on-year that you highlighted that's beneficial that potentially get that $700 million cost locked down. Now you know did say incentives on carryovers, I mean could they be less of drag next year based on an reversing [ph] some of those hard headwinds on the trucks. I'm just trying to get a sense, really is, is the profit increase really driven by volume with these two things cancelling up or could we be in a situation, where price and cost all in is also positive year-on-year. Chuck Stevens : Yes, on a carryover basis as we indicated from a pricing standpoint in 2013, '14 we've been running roughly negative 1% net price maybe a little bit more this year. We expect that to moderate next year from a net pricing perspective. So year-over-year carryover pricing will be a tailwind. We expect material cost year-over-year material performance to be a tailwind consistent with what we said October 1, obviously [indiscernible] will be a benefit overall, as we were bridging to 2016. We're working to manage to flat fixed cost kind of environment and then our next-generation products as we launch, the next-generation Cruze, Malibu, Equinox. We expect those vehicles to be more profitable not only from carryover material cost, but just material cost performance in the vehicles as well as improved pricing versus the vehicles that they're replacing. So those were the big drivers. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Okay and so it does sound, I mean there is a lot of opportunity there. I mean, it sounds like the net of pricing in cost could be positive on a year-on-year basis? Chuck Stevens : I would think so, yes. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs :  Okay, alright. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator :  And there are no further questions at this time. Turn the conference back over to you. Mary Barra : Great, thank you operator. Well, we've covered a lot of ground today. so I'm going to keep my remarks brief. In the last 10 months, that this leadership has been together. We spent a significant amount of time defining our goals for the future of GM and developing an integrated holistic plant. At the Global Business Conference, we shared some of our key initiatives including a product development strategy, where we expect to deliver [indiscernible] vehicles and core operating efficiency. Today, we shared solid results that underscore our strong position in United States and China and we also showed resilience in the face of headwinds and other markets. Taken together all of the ingredients are there for GM to create significant value for customers and shareholders overtime. Clearly, we have a lot of work ahead of us, but I expect to meet all of our goals for two reasons; first our integrated approach is designed to systematically and methodically build a more profitable General Motors. We've recognized that it will take time, but we are confident we are on the right path. Second, we have never been more aligned as our leadership team are more focused as a company and I believe that's exactly what you need for long-term success and I look forward to the next opportunity to update you on our progress. I appreciate your time today, thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the conference call for today. we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good everyone.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 4, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx : Thanks, Operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us as we review the GM financial results for the 2014 fourth quarter and calendar year. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via the Internet. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors\u2019 Chief Executive Officer will provide opening remarks followed by a review of the financial results with Chuck Stevens, Executive Vice President and CFO. After the presentation portion of the call, we\u2019ll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Marry Barra will then conclude the call with some closing remarks. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist and answering your questions. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Randy, and thanks to everyone joining the call today. Over the last couple of months, we have several opportunities to talk to you in detail about our strategy to create shareholder value, including our operating strategy, the investments we are making in our brand, technology and innovation, as well as our financial targets. At our Global Business Conference in October, we affirmed our mid-decade targets and outlined strategies to deliver 9% to 10% EBIT adjusted margins by early next decade. At the Deutsche Bank Auto Conference last month, we affirmed that we were on track to deliver strong operating results in 2014 and we shared our outlook for 2015. This outlook includes year-over-year improvement in all of our automotive regions with higher EBIT adjusted and stronger margins. Today, we are reporting fourth quarter and full year 2014 results that demonstrate continued strong core operating performance. This is especially true in North America and China where we are busy -- where our business is highly profitable and growing. It\u2019s also true in other regions around the world where we are managing through very difficult market conditions and building a solid foundation for profitable growth. As we execute our plans, we are focused on generating the level of earnings, margin and cash flow that will make us the most valued automaker for our owners. Our strategy is also designed to support a strong and growing dividend and consistent with our strong core operating performance, we intend to increase our second quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.36 per share. The decision on the expected dividend increase will be made by our Board as part of the regularly scheduled second quarter dividend declaration procedure. Turning to slide two, let\u2019s take a closer look at our fourth quarter results, which were robust. We have now been profitable for 20 consecutive quarters and this was our best ever fourth quarter consolidated EBIT adjusted during that period. As you can see on the chart, almost all of our key operating metrics were up, including global deliveries and net income to the common shareholders. Importantly, EBIT adjusted was up in three of our automotive regions, the fourth was flat and our automotive net cash from operating activities and adjusted automotive free cash flow was also very strong. In North America, we had record average transaction prices driven by Cadillac and our new Chevrolet and GMC truck and SUV, and we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of improved EBIT adjusted margins based on core operating performance. In China, we had another solid quarter, contributing to record full year equity income as our sales continued to outpace the market. In South America the team has now delivered three consecutive quarters of improved EBIT adjusted results. And in Europe, Opel\u2019s core operating results improved, excluding the recent economic decline in Russia. The quarter kept a full year of solid core operating performance. If you turn to slide three, we can review our 2014 results. To start, we delivered our second consecutive year of record global sales, deliveries rose 2% to 9.9 million light vehicle. We had record sales in, excuse me, and market share in China and higher sales and stable share in North America, a clear highlight we sold close to a 1 million full-size pickups full-size SUVs and large luxury SUVs in the United States, and increased our share in all three segments. In fact, our share of the large SUV segment now stands at more than 75%. I expect we can do even better this year from a volume standpoint and we have another opportunity to gain full-size pickup market share. Our global share was down one-tenth of a point, which primarily reflects our decision to withdraw Chevrolet as a mainstream brand in Western and Central Europe, and our use of pricing to offset currency volatility in regions such as South America and Russia. Net revenue increased by about $5 million to $155.9 billion, thanks to growth at GM Financial. Looking at the bottomline, net income to common shareholders was $2.8 billion, absent special items, net income to common shareholders would have been $5.2 billion. Our Automotive business meanwhile generated $10.1 billion in net cash from operating activities. Turning to EBIT adjusted, we earned $6.5 billion, which includes $2.8 billion in recall-related expenses. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.1 billion. Chuck Stevens will provide more details on the fourth quarter and 2014 calendar year financial results a bit later. If you turn to the next slide, you will see that our calendar year highlights are organized around strategic priorities, so it will be easy to see how we are driving the business forward. Let start with our relationship with customers, specifically our commitment to safety and quality. The recalls we experienced in 2014 were galvanizing and our response has been far-reaching as you well know. I won\u2019t review everything we have done on this call. Instead, I will simply underscore that we have built what I believe is the best safety organization in the industry and we\u2019re instilling a zero defect mindset across the company. Our work begins from a solid base, last year, for example, J.D. Power ranked -- J.D. Power ranked GM number two in initial quality, number three in durability and three of our brands, Chevrolet, GMC and Buick took three of the top four spots in customer satisfaction with Dealer Service Index. In addition, Cadillac was recognized as a 2014 Customer Champions by J.D. Power, the third time the brand has earned this distinction. Let\u2019s continue the discussion of our brand starting with Chevrolet, our largest global brand. Chevrolet had a very good 2014 in North America, with sales up about 5%. The new Silverado, Tahoe and Suburban all had great momentum, and the new Colorado which won Motor Trend Truck of the Year is off to a great start. Chevrolet had record sales in China and the brand retained market leadership in South America, despite weak industry conditions that hurt sales. Buick also had a fantastic year with record sales of almost 1.2 million vehicles in its core markets of China, United States, Canada and Mexico. Robust demand in China also lifted Wuling and Baojun which had record sales. GM also increased it sales for the fifth consecutive year and the new Canyon was named Autoweek Magazine Best of the Best/Truck for 2015. Turning to Cadillac, the brands global sales increased 5% on the strength of a 47% increase in China. That brings the brand\u2019s cumulative volume growth since 2012 to 35%. But we understand we have a lot of work ahead of us with Cadillac. As Johan de Nysschen shared at the Detroit Auto Show, we are investing in the portfolio by developing eight new Cadillac models by the end of the decade, many of which are going to enter segments where we don\u2019t compete today. Turning to Europe, Karl-Thomas Neumann and the Opel/Vauxhall team continued to make good progress. Opel/Vauxhall delivered almost 1.1 million vehicles in Europe in 2014, sales and share increased for a second year in a row and orders for the new Corsa are ahead of plan at more than 110,000 units. Turning to GM Financial, it\u2019s important to note that they\u2019re going to play an increasingly important role in helping all of our brands grow as they transform into a full spectrum captive finance company. For example, GM Financial is now writing half of all GM lease transactions in the United States and that figure will rise when it becomes the exclusive lease provider for Buick and GMC this month, followed by Cadillac later in the quarter. GM Financial is also financing roughly 40% of GM\u2019s retail sales in Europe and South America, and in early January it completed the acquisition of Ally\u2019s joint venture in China. Leading in technology and innovation, especially in the areas of connectivity and autonomous are key are we move forward. It is a critical component of our customer-centered brand building strategy and an area we are -- where we are moving much faster than our competitors in many respect. For example, last year we began the rollout of OnStar with 4G LTE in North America on more than 30 models. Later this year, 4G LTE will be introduced in China where we have more than 800,000 subscribers. We will also launch OnStar with 4G LTE in Europe. We intend to leverage 4G LTE and its fast speed to introduce a wide range of features and apps to improve all aspect of the driving and ownership experience. In January at the Consumer Electronics Show we previewed technology that can predict and notify drivers when certain components need attention, in many cases before vehicle performance is impacted. It will be available later this year on a wide range of 2016 models in the U.S. and Canada including the Chevrolet Equinox, Tahoe, Suburban, Corvette and Silverado. As we move through the year, we will also be sharing more details about industry-leading GM technology including vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity and Super Cruise, which is an advanced automated driving feature that Cadillac expects to introduce during the 2017 model year. The last point, I\u2019d like to make before turning the presentation over to Chuck is this, we will continue to aggressively pursue core operating efficiency. We made good progress in 2014 with more than $1 billion in non-raw material and logistic cost savings flowing through the bottomline. We\u2019ve also improved capacity utilization in Europe and our focus on the Opel Vauxhall brands in Western and Central Europe have dramatically improved our business in the region. Also our new operational excellence team using Six Sigma and other statistical and analytical tools as part of an overarching strategy to drive a customer-centric culture of continuous improvement, innovation and quality is well underway. Gerald Johnson is leading this initiative and we\u2019re moving very quickly. We have been recruiting talent from outside and inside GM, executive champions have been [Technical Difficulty] and we\u2019ve already identified projects that we expect to deliver significant savings this year with customer loyalty and operating margin building over time. This is a good start but we know there is more work to do but we are on it.\u2019 With that said, let me hand off to Chuck Stevens, who will provide a more detailed look at the quarter and the year. Chuck Stevens : Thanks Mary. On slide six, we provide a summary of our 2014 fourth quarter and calendar year GAAP and non-GAAP results. Starting with Q4 first, our net revenue was $39.6 billion, $900 million or 2% decrease from the prior year. Automotive revenue was down nearly $1.1 billion primarily due to lower wholesales of 73,000 units or an unfavorable $1.4 billion, unfavorable foreign exchange of $1.7 billion partially offset by an increase in price of $1.6 billion. GM financial revenue increased $200 million. Our fourth quarter 2014 GAAP operating income included net $250 million of unfavorable special items as detailed on chart seven. The prior year GAAP operating income performance included significant unfavorable special items of $1.4 billion in the quarter primarily related to the exit of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and impairment charges. Net income to common shareholders was $1.1 billion, up $200 million compared to the prior year period. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.66 on a diluted basis compared to $0.57 for the same period in the prior year and our automotive net cash from operating activities improved significantly to $3.8 billion. Our EBIT-adjusted was $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter, a $500 million improvement from the prior year. The EBIT-adjusted margin was 6.1%, up 1.4 percentage points from the fourth quarter in 2013. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $1.8 billion, including $600 million in recall-related cash payments. This compares to adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the prior year period. For the full calendar year, net revenue was $156 billion, up $500 million from the prior year. Automotive revenue decreased $1 billion primarily due to lower wholesales of 380,000 units, which was worth an unfavorable $5.6 billion, unfavorable foreign exchange of $3.3 billion, partially offset by favorable pricing of $5.1 billion and favorable mix of $2.3 billion. GM financial revenue increased $1.5 billion. Our GAAP operating income was $1.5 billion, including $2.8 billion in recall-related charges as well as $2.3 billion in special items. In the prior year period, GAAP operating income was $5.1 billion. Net income to common shareholders was $2.8 billion and diluted earnings per share came in at $1.65, again the decrease was primarily attributable to recall-related costs, increased charges for special items and lower income tax expense. Our automotive net cash from operating activities was $10.1 billion, including $1.6 billion in recall-related cash payments. This compares to automotive net cash from operating activities of $11 billion in 2013. For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT-adjusted was $6.5 billion in 2014 including $2.8 billion of recall related costs, as well as $1 billion in restructuring expenses. EBIT-adjusted margin was 4.2%, including the negative impact of 1.8 percentage points associated with recall-related costs. Finally, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.1 billion for the year, including $1.6 billion recall-related payments, resulting in a net $600 million decrease from 2013. Slide seven identifies special items for the fourth quarter and calendar year that had an impact on our earnings per share. I\u2019m not going to go through the entire list but the items in 2014 primarily relate to the redemption of our Series A preferred stock, a recall-reserve catch-up adjustment, the recall compensation program and a number of impairment charges. In 2013, special items, primarily related to strategic actions we announced in GM international operations, the wage litigation in Korea, as well as sale of certain non-core assets. At the top of slide, our net income to common stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.1 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share was $0.66. Special items had a net $900 million unfavorable impact to net income to common shareholders and $0.53 unfavorable impact on earnings per share. For the 2014 calendar year, our net income to common shareholders was $2.8 billion and our fully diluted earnings per share were $1.65. Special items had an unfavorable impact on net income to common shareholders of $2.4 billion and a $1.40 unfavorable impact on our earnings per share. Slide eight shows our consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we again show the revenue and margins for the quarter, clearly demonstrating the solid underlying performance that the company achieved in 2014 when adjusting for recall-related expenses. Our consolidated wholesale vehicle sales were 1.6 million vehicles in the fourth quarter, down slightly compared to the prior year and our global market share was 11.4%. On slide nine, we provide an explanation of the $500 million increase in year-over-year consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2013, our EBIT-adjusted was $1.9 billion. Volume was $300 million unfavorable as global wholesale volume decreased 73,000 units, primarily attributable to lower wholesales in international operations and the wind down of Chevrolet Europe. Mix was $300 million favorable primarily due to increased wholesales of full-size trucks and full-size SUVs. Price was $1.4 billion favorable for the quarter, primarily due to the strength of our recently launched vehicles in North America and actions we\u2019ve taken to offset foreign exchange in South America. Total costs were $600 million unfavorable, primarily attributable to higher material costs in North America related to our recently launched full size trucks and full size SUVs. Other was $300 million unfavorable primarily due to foreign exchange challenges in South America with, Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentine Peso and Brazilian Real as well as pressure on the Russia Ruble in Europe. This totals $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter. On slide 10, we provide EBIT-adjusted by region for the four quarters of 2013 and 2014. North America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted was $2.2 billion. Europe had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $400 million. International operations had EBIT-adjusted of $400 million and South America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted was a positive $100 million for the quarter. GM financial earnings before taxes adjusted was $100 million, down from a year ago associated with debt-related expenses. The corporate and elimination segment was breakeven for the quarter. This totals to an EBIT-adjusted of $2.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014, up $500 million from the same period in 2013. We now move on to our segment results. On slide 11, we show North American EBIT-adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up $200 million from the same quarter in 2013. The EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.7% for the fourth quarter and 9.1% for the second half of 2014, an improvement of about 70 basis points compared to the second half of 2013. For the full year, EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.9% excluding the impact of recalls. Six consecutive quarters of year-over-year margin growth excluding recalls demonstrate strong progress toward our 2016 goal of 10% margins. Our U.S. dealer inventory was 737,000 at the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease of about 11,000 units from the prior year period. Also, vehicle sales were 849,000 units for the quarter, a 14,000 unit vehicle decrease from the prior year. Turning to slide 12 for key performance indicators for North America. For the fourth quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 17.4% and our retail share was 16.3%. Retail share increased 0.4 percentage points from the prior year, led by our all new midsized trucks, full-size truck and full-size SUVs. In fact full-size truck retail share increased nearly 5 percentage points from a year ago to approximately 41% in the fourth quarter. Our incentives for the quarter were 11.2% of average transaction price, which put us at 110% of the industry average. Turning to slide 13, we provide the explanation of the increase in North America EBIT-adjusted of about $300 million. EBIT-adjusted was $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter of 2013. Volume was $100 million unfavorable associated with the 14,000 unit vehicle decrease in wholesales. Mix was $300 million favorable, primarily due to increased wholesales of full-size truck and full-size SUVs. Price was $400 million favorable as the $800 million in favorable pricing from our recently launched vehicles was partially offset by $400 million in unfavorable pricing from our carryover products. Costs were $400 million unfavorable, primarily due to increased material costs associated with recently launched vehicles, partially offset by carryover material and logistics performance. Other was flat. These nets to an EBIT adjusted of $2.2 billion. On slide 14, Europe reported an EBIT adjusted loss of $400 million for the fourth quarter, flat from the prior year. However, after excluding restructuring and the impact of the Russian market, the European business demonstrated improved core operating performance on a year-over-year basis. Revenue was $5.4 billion for the quarter, down $300 million from the prior year period. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was a negative 7.3%. Wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter improved 6,000 units. Market share in the fourth quarter was 6.3%, a nine-tenth of a percentage point decline from 2013, as the increase in Opel, Vauxhall market share for the second consecutive year was more than offset by the negative impact of the Chevrolet brand wind down. On slide 15, we provide the major components of Europe\u2019s EBIT adjusted performance versus a year ago. Volume was flat as increased wholesales in Western Europe and the rest of the region was essentially offset by the roughly 40% decline in Russian wholesales. Mix was flat. Price was $100 million favorable, driven primarily by pricing offset exchange headwinds in Russia and the introduction of the next-generation Corsa and Vivaro. Cost was flat as increased material costs associated with recently launched vehicles were offset by material and logistics performance on carryover vehicles. Other was $200 million unfavorable, primarily due to foreign exchange related to the Russian ruble. This totals the Europe\u2019s EBIT adjusted loss of $400 million for the fourth quarter of 2014. On slide 16, we show international operations\u2019 EBIT adjusted for the most recent periods. In the fourth quarter, EBIT adjusted was $400 million, including equity income from our joint ventures of $500 million, partially offset by a loss of a $100 million in consolidated operations. At the bottom of the slide, revenue from consolidated operations was $3.8 billion, down $600 million from the prior year. The EBIT adjusted margin from consolidated operations was a negative 2.7%, a decline of nine-tenths of a percentage point from the prior year. Our average net income margin from our China JVs remained strong at 8.7%, a 1.1 percentage point increase from the prior year. For the full calendar year, net income margin was 9.8%, up three-tenths of a percent from the prior year. Wholesale vehicle sales totaled 177,000 units for consolidated operations and 981,000 units for the China JVs. Market share in the region increased from the prior year, including record market share in China of 14.8% for the 2014 calendar year. Turning to slide 17, we provide the major components of international operations\u2019 $200 million increase in EBIT adjusted. The impact of volume was $200 million unfavorable as wholesales decreased 54,000 units. Mix was flat compared to the prior year period. Price was $300 million favorable, primarily due to the recently launched full-size trucks and full-size SUVs in the Middle East. Cost was $100 million unfavorable associated with material on recently launched products. Other was $100 million favorable, primarily related to an increase in equity income from our China JVs. This totals the fourth quarter 2014 EBIT adjusted of $400 million. On slide 18, we move onto the South America region and look at EBIT adjusted for the last five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue was $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, a $400 million decrease from 2013. The EBIT adjusted margin in the region was 2.4%, an increase of 1.7 percentage points from the prior year period. Wholesale vehicle sales were 249,000 units, down 11,000 units, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and market share decreased 1 percentage point from the prior year period. On slide 19, we look at the components of the $100 million year-over-year increase in our South American EBIT adjusted. Volume and mix were flat compared to the prior year. Price was $600 million favorable due to actions we\u2019ve taken to offset unfavorable foreign exchange and the sustained strength of pricing on our new products. Cost was $100 million unfavorable, primarily due to higher material costs on carryover products. Other was $400 million unfavorable due to the Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentine Peso and Brazilian Real currencies. It\u2019s important to note that team in South America delivered three consecutive quarters of improved EBIT adjusted results even as conditions became more challenging in the region. Slide 20 provides the summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial reported the results this morning and we will be holding an earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the fourth quarter decreased 6 percentage points from the prior year to 6.6%. Our U.S. lease penetration is 21.9% in Q4, up 1.1 percentage points from the prior year, as we continue to approach the industry average. As mentioned earlier, we expect this lease growth trend to continue as GM Financial becomes the exclusive lease provider for Buick and GMC, with plans for the Cadillac brand later this spring. Lease penetration in Canada is at 17.8%, a decrease of 1.8 percentage points from the prior year period. GM\u2019s new vehicle financing as a percentage of GM Financial origination, continues to grow as our financing subsidiary continues to expand its leasing, subprime and prime lending footprint. GM Financial\u2019s percentage of GM\u2019s U.S. consumer subprime financing and leasing increased to 43% in the quarter. Annualized net credit losses remained low at 2.2%. Earnings before tax adjusted decreased to $119 million for the fourth quarter, primarily due to incremental investment in systems, people and consumer portfolio growth, resulting in increased interest and provision expenses. Slide 21 provides our walk with adjusted automotive free cash flow for the fourth quarter and calendar year. Starting with Q4 first, our net income to common shareholders was $1.1 billion. Adding back the impact of non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and the Series A redemption then deducting GM Financial earnings, we arrive at an automotive income of $2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014. We had a $100 million in non-cash special items and our depreciation and amortization expense was $1.4 billion. Working capital was a $1.4 billion source of cash. The $1.2 billion improvement from the prior year was primarily due to one fewer supplier payment cycle in Q4 compared to the prior year period, partially offset by increased receivable balances. U.S. pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $200 million in the quarter. Other was $900 million use of cash, which includes recall related cash payments as well as approximately $500 million in non-cash equity income. This totals down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $3.8 billion. We had $2 billion of capital expenditures in the quarter, which brings us to adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.8 billion, up $700 million compared to the prior year, despite $600 million of recall-related cash payments. Taking a look at the full calendar year, starting with net income to common shareholders of $2.8 billion, we add back the impact of non-controlling interests, preferred dividends and the Series A redemption, then deduct GM Financial earnings to arrive at an automotive income of $3.5 billion for the calendar year for 2014. We had $1.6 billion in non-cash special items that I covered earlier and our depreciation and amortization expense was a $5.8 billion expense. Working capital for the year was a $1.6 billion use of cash. The $1.1 billion decline from the prior year was primarily due to increased receivables outstanding at year-end, partially offset by one fewer supplier payment cycle in 2014 versus the prior year. U.S. pension and OPEB cash payments exceeded expenses by $900 million in 2014. Other was a $1.7 billion source of cash, which is primarily attributable to recall and warranty accruals in excess of recall-related cash payments. This totals down to automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $10.1 billion. We had $7 billion of capital expenditures during the year, which brings us to adjusted automotive free cash flow of $3.1 billion for the year, including $1.6 billion in recall-related cash payments. Updating our prior guidance, we expect adjusted automotive free cash flow to be flat to up in 2015 versus 2014. However, given normal seasonality, combined with approximately $500 million in recall-related cash payments, approximately $500 million in restructuring payments and an additional supplier payment cycle compared to the first quarter of 2014, we do expect a net cash outflow in the first quarter. Turning to slide 22, we closed the year with a strong liquidity position of $37.2 billion, including $25.2 billion in cash and marketable securities. The change in our net cash position included approximately $2 billion in return of capital to our shareholders through our common stock dividend. Debt increased to $9.4 billion, as we took advantage of the credit markets this past November to raise funds to partially fund the redemption of the Series A preferred shares. That transaction was executed on December 31st of last year and resulted in a reduction to net income to common shareholders of $800 million associated with the difference between the redemption price and the book value of the preferred stock. Our total U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans are under funded by $10.9 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion versus a year ago, which we will further discuss in a moment. Our non-U.S. pensions are under funded by $13.1 billion at the end of the fourth quarter and our global unfunded OPEB liability is $6.6 billion\u2026 On slide 23, we take a look at the funded status of our global and US pension plans for the past four years. At the end of 2014, we had a global pension benefit obligation of $105 billion. Our global pension underfunded position increased to $24 billion. As it relates to our US pension plans, our underfunded status at the end of 2014 was $10.9 billion, an increase of $3.6 billion. $2.2 billion was due to mortality assumptions as a result of incorporating recently issued new mortality and mortality improvement tables by the Society of Actuaries. The new table shows increase in life expectancies, which have the effect of increasing aggregate expected benefit payments. The remaining increase in our underfunded status is due primarily to the effects of decreasing discount rates, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns. Now let\u2019s take a look at the full calendar year EBIT-adjusted on slide 24. North America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted decreased to $6.6 billion, including the $2.4 billion of recall-related expenses. Europe had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $1.4 billion, which included an incremental $500 million in restructuring expense as well as increasingly challenging conditions in Russia versus a year ago. International operations had EBIT-adjusted of $1.2 billion, down slightly from the prior year. South America\u2019s EBIT-adjusted decreased to $200 million loss for 2014, as the region faced a challenging macro environment, including significant foreign exchange headwinds. GM Financial had earnings before taxes adjusted of $800 million for the year. This totals to an EBIT-adjusted of $6.5 billion. On slide 25, we provide an explanation of the $2.1 billion decrease in year-over-year EBIT-adjusted. Our EBIT-adjusted was $8.6 billion for 2013. Volume was 1 billion decrease, as wholesale volumes were down significantly in international operations and South America due to challenging macro environments and the wind down of the Chevrolet brand in Europe. This was partially offset by increased wholesales in North America. Mix was favorable $300 million, primarily due to full-size truck and full-size SUVs in North America as well as improving country mix in Europe. Price was $4.9 billion favorable for the year led by the strength of our new vehicle introductions in North America and price actions to offset foreign exchange impacts globally, partially offset by modest unfavorable pricing on carryover products. Although 2014 was a very strong year for year-over-year pricing improvement, we expect the impact on pricing to moderate as we cycle past the introduction of our new full-size trucks and SUVs in North America. For 2015, we expect total net price to remain positive compared to full year 2014 on a consolidated basis. However, we would expect a stronger pricing environment as we enter our aggressive launch cadence of new cars and crossovers in 2016. Total costs were unfavorable $5.2 billion for the year, primarily attributable to recall-related cost of $2.8 billion, increased material cost associated with the recently launched vehicles of $3.6 billion, incremental restructuring expense of $500 million, partially offset by favorable material cost performance associated with carryover products of $900 million, and approximately $500 million in lower marketing cost. Other was $1.1 billion unfavorable, primarily due to foreign exchange challenges in South America associated with the Venezuelan Bolivar, Argentine peso, and the Brazilian real, as well as the Russian ruble and euro. This was partially offset with $300 million and increased equity income from our China joint ventures. Summing it all up on slide 26. 2014 was a very solid year. The automotive business delivered strong core operating performance, absent recall expense and GM Financials continues to contribute solid earnings, as it reinvests in the business for future growth and to support incremental sales at the auto company. For 2015 specifically, we expect EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins to improve in all automotive regions. As Mary mentioned earlier, given the strong core operating performance in 2014 and our expectations for stronger performance in 2015, we intend to raise the common stock dividend 20% to $0.36 per share in the second quarter of this year. This action is consistent with our stated objective of a strong and growing dividend supported by improved business results and the planned increase demonstrates our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time. Finally, we are on track with financial commitments we set for 2016, specifically 10% EBIT-adjusted margins in North America, profitability in Europe, and maintaining strong net income margins in China. And all of this would lead us to the longer-term 2020 plus financial targets we outlined last October. Now Mary and I will take your questions, after which Mary will have some closing remarks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. I was wondering if you can just answer a couple things on North America, first. If you sum up the combination of pricing, mix, and content cost, just to kind of run a proxy for contribution margins, you had a big positive in the first quarter of 2014, like $600 million, then it was positive again in Q2, but little less to negative in Q3 and then reversed, and is $300 million or positive year-over-year in the fourth quarter. It looks like mix now is running more positive than we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. And I would think that it\u2019s -- your expectations are better than where they were back in October. Can you just give us some high level thoughts on how you think contribution margins overall look for 2015 and extent to which that could be a source of upside? Chuck Stevens : Yeah, I would certainly suggest that with the recent fuel prices and strength in full-size SUVs, full-size trucks and crossovers that mix will be a tailwind in 2015 and better than what we expected back in October, again given what transpire with fuel prices. I think there is also, as we talked before Rod is we cycled through the first year launch of trucks and SUVs where the year-over-year impact falls into pricing. We are going to see more of that show up in mix in 2015 versus 2014 as well. Rod Lache : Okay. And can you also give us some insight into your expectations for structural costs looking forward? It looks like you didn\u2019t really discuss structural costs this year. There were some items, like D&A, which was down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. I believe you guys are expecting structural costs to be up a bit in 2015. What is the high level expectation there? Chuck Stevens : Yeah, let me start with 2014 overall, when we look at overhead, fixed costs, structural costs, whatever we want to call it, relatively flat in \u201814 versus \u201813, as we took actions around the world. As we indicated back at the conference in January, we would expect to see overhead costs up on a year-over-year basis and the primary driver of that is incremental engineering and incremental marketing as we head into our very strong launch cadence in the latter part of 2015 and 2016. And I would say that that\u2019s prevalent from a North American and a European perspective primarily. Rod Lache : Okay. And just lastly, can you just touch on your updated views on China. Obviously, there has been quite a bit of discussion about inventory levels there and capacity growth, DMS, and specific strategies to mitigate that, but just from a high level, has there been any change in the competitive environment there? Chuck Stevens : No significant change from what we discussed in January. We indicated in January that we\u2019re monitoring the situation very closely. We still expect the industry to be up year-over-year somewhere in the range of 5% to 8%, call it 25.5 million to 26 million units. Our inventory position actually is in really good shape right now. Through the month of January and early February, we are down below our target days on hand at a dealer level. So our expectations are still consistent with what we talked before. Industry growth will continue to grow our revenue and we will maintain our net income margins in the 9% to 10% range, resulting in higher equity income. Rod Lache : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Chuck Stevens : Hi, John. John Murphy : A first question on trucks, I mean obviously you\u2019re highlighting there is some potential upside there given what\u2019s going on with your product as well as what\u2019s going on with gas prices. I\u2019m just curious where you\u2019re running on capacity utilization on the K2XX right now, what the potential for upside to that capacity might be in 2015, and how we should think about incremental profitability as you stretch out that capacity maybe? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. I would say this we are running pretty hard right now from a capacity utilization perspective. We do have opportunities at a system level from a capacity perspective primarily in double cabs. We continue to work very, very hard on a day-to-day basis with the supply base and our manufacturing to increase capacity. On crew cabs, we\u2019ve got capacity on heavy duties as well. So we think, obviously, there is some production upside in the system and again, we\u2019re working to eliminate any bottlenecks. As I think about the overall opportunity John, it\u2019s not just volume, there\u2019s also mix, where customer demand increases for trucks. There\u2019s an opportunity to up-sell from a mix perspective. And ultimately, in the overall supply and demand equation, we\u2019ll be looking at price and that was one of the reasons why back in October and again in January, I said that, we thought that the truck pricing environment was going to moderate in 2015. John Murphy : Okay. And maybe just some specifics around that, I mean, do you think that you could increase your production or volume on these trucks 10% year-over-year, is that something that is viable given your footprint? I\u2019m just trying to understand the potential upside just on a volume basis? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. I\u2019ve rather not get into those specific. That\u2019s a bit competitive dynamic there that we like -- I would just suggest that, if the industry segment runs at 12.3% to 12.5% and the industry is in the range that we expected to $16.5 million to $17 million, we will have system-wide capacity to build a deal with that. John Murphy : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then second question on the CapEx for 2015, you\u2019re talking about $9 billion, which is a pretty big step up? I\u2019m just curious, if there\u2019s any way that you might be able to thrift that through the course of the year and if maybe you can explain why there is this real big step function increase in CapEx? Mary Barra : Yeah. I would say, first of all, on thrifting, we\u2019re always looking at that impact. We\u2019ve got quite a few initiative and driver from a global perspective, so both from a supplier vendor tooling perspective and the capital that goes into our plan. So we review that in great detail and are continuing to work on initiative to take that down. But then when you look at it, I think of it in three buckets. One is new products that are within our existing portfolio and look at in some of the technology that we\u2019re driving into the vehicles for industry leading fuel efficiency, as well as autonomous and connectivity, making sure we\u2019re making the right investments with a customer focus there. And then the third impact or the third bucket I look at is, we believe there is opportunity in segments we\u2019re not in around the globe that we\u2019ll generate the right return and can enhance our brands and enhance our market position. So looking at those three buckets and again it\u2019s an area, I ran in the company at one point in my career, there is an intense focus on that and we\u2019ll seize every opportunity. John Murphy : Okay. And then just lastly, if we think about GM Financial, your commitment there and to grow, that sounds like it makes a tremendous amount of sense? But it sounds like there is a pretty heavy investment period here that you started in the fourth quarter? I\u2019m just curious how long you think that investment period will last? And then also additionally, what kind of capital might you need to commit to that business overtime to really grow the balance sheet to support it, because it sounds like you are doing mostly on balance sheet financing there? So just trying to understand the capital equipment too? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. First, the result in the fourth quarter is not run rate. I mean, there was some investment for growth and taking provisions as you bring on new loans have a bit of a tail on it before you started to get the full benefit of the income. So there is some timing there. There is a significant portion of the variance on a year-over-year basis were some nonrecurring items. I go back again to what we talked about in January, we expect GMF profitability as we ramp up our capability to be flat on a year-over-year basis in \u201815 versus \u201814. And then we\u2019ll start to see the incremental benefit of the growth in their portfolio, the growth in their originations in \u201816 and beyond. Relative to any capital calls on the auto company. We certainly don\u2019t anticipate any in this growth plan. We went through that and that\u2019s going to all be self-funded from GMF. We run a number of scenarios including downside risk scenarios and again, minimal to none on a go-forward basis, John. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Please go ahead. Brian Johnson : Yes. Good morning. Just want to ask sort of a housekeeping question on cash flow for next year and then kind of a broader question around the CapEx investments, continuing that line? You booked $2.5 billion of accruals for recalls? You paid out less than that, so it seems like that is a $900 million cash call this upcoming year? You mentioned $500 million of restructuring expense? I guess a question for Chuck is, within your guide of flat year-over-year cash flow, what is, if you will, the bills that you are paying that were accrued in 2014 that cash is going out of the door in 2015 and if you could just mention for -- that for us? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Sure. Overall, from a recall perspective, including the Feinberg compensation program, we accrued roughly $3.2 billion that showed up and impacted our P&L in 2014. We made about $1.6 billion of cash payments in 2014 associated with that, which means we have a carry-on into 2015 of a further -- 2015 and beyond $1.6 billion. As we indicated in January, we expect to incur about $1.2 billion of cash costs in 2015 associated with those accruals that we took in 2014 and then the balance would bleed out into 2016. A lot of its dependent on timing of getting the vehicles repaired, et cetera. In addition to that, we highlighted that there was going to be an overflow into 2015 associated with restructuring expense recall. We booked a $1 billion of restructuring expense against the P&L in 2014. We anticipated roughly $300 million of that flowing over into 2015. So between the two, about a $1.5 billion broad strokes Brian rolling over from \u201814 into \u201815. Brian Johnson : Okay. And kind of second or related to that before I ask the CapEx question. Does that kind of feed into just getting those cash payments out the door, apparently which is [indiscernible] quoted you on saying there is a possibility for second half we are looking at cash to shareholders, maybe you could elaborate on that. Chuck Stevens : Well, yeah, what I specifically said was, our objective and our focus is to drive shareholder value and shareholder returns, evidenced by the intended increase in the dividend. And then looking beyond the first half of the year, we have a number of open items that we still need to get clarity around related to the recall. Separate from these issues that we just talk about, Brian, this is ongoing litigation and other issues. And to the extent that we get clarity and understand what those issues are and the potential impact from a cash perspective, we could be in a position in the second half of the year, where we would evaluate further returns of capital to shareholders and that\u2019s something we continuously monitor and evaluate. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then finally, on CapEx, the $9 billion, which you discussed some of the drivers, Mary, thank you for the increase? To what extent can we expect either as a dollar amount or percent of sales this to continue? And, secondly, particularly for some of the investments in technology and in new product introductions, kind of when is the timing for when those investments ought to get return on investment. Not to sound like a bean counter, but I\u2019m sure you count. Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Sure. A big portion of the $9 billion is associated with our products that we\u2019re going to be launching at the tailend of \u201815 and into \u201816 and \u201817. And when you look at what we talked about from a margin expansion perspective, North America 10% margins, Europe profitability, we indicated that the next-generation Cruze, next-generation Malibu, the Corsa, the Astra and some of these other products will going to be more profitable than the vehicles that they replace. So the return on a big portion of this capital, which is portfolio related, will start to see roll through in \u201816 and \u201817. And if you add up the guidance we provided for 2016, you quickly get to overall consolidated margins that are much more robust than we are today and that\u2019s really the return for that investment. Brian Johnson : Okay. And sort of level of CapEx in \u201816, \u201817, \u201818? Chuck Stevens : What I said before in our outlook hasn\u2019t changed on that. We would expect on a go-forward basis, as we move through a number of the items that Mary talked about both portfolio, fuel-efficient technologies, advanced proportion and other innovations that our capital spending would be around industry average, call it 5.5% in net sales just to provide some broad guidance on that. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, I noticed there were some headlines that you were taking some price cuts on models in North America, but your comments today indicate that we should think of pricing as relatively flat. So can you explain some of the logic behind the pricing strategy that was recently announced? Mary Barra : I don\u2019t know specifically what you\u2019re referring to, if you\u2019re referring to Cadillac, what they fundamentally did was reposition option packages and content. When I look at carryover pricing in North America, I indicated in the past that we expect it to be flat to slightly a headwind in 2015. As we cycle through the full-size truck and SUV dynamic and actually, we are in the last year of a number of our products that we talked about before Cruze, Malibu and others. So the specific actions from a Cadillac perspective, was really adjusting packaging content and the starting-form price to the entry-level vehicle and not the whole line up of Cadillac products. And we do that quite often, when we look at, trying to make sure that we\u2019ve got the content lined up with what the customers want. Colin Langan : Okay. I think the recent article said that on some of your Chevy models, I think including the Cruze and some SUVs, you were cutting the base price by $1,500 to $2,500. Does that sound accurate? Chuck Stevens : Probably, it\u2019s the same issue. Adjusting starting-from price, which at the end of day helps from a digital Internet shopping perspective but fundamentally very-very low penetration levels on those models. Colin Langan : Got it. Okay. And any color on the GMIO consolidated fix, I mean, you are targeting, I believe you said that it was going to be a breakeven ex-restructuring next year. It was losing I think around $900 million this year. What are the key drivers to getting that back to profitability -- back to breakeven? And then any color on what you are going to do with the facilities that were supplying the Chevy Europe vehicles? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Sure. I\u2019ll answer the first part first. One, one big driver year-over-year is the absence of Chevrolet Europe losses. So, I\u2019m not going to get into the specifics of that, but that\u2019s one of the drivers in the improvement \u201815 versus \u201814. Second, full year of full-size pickups and full-size utilities in the Middle East, and third, just continuing to drive efficiency in the core operations and the rest of consolidated operations. And I think you saw that if you looked at the results during 2014 quarter-in quarter-out, the results got better, still little loss, but the results got better. And we would expect to see that ex-restructuring in 2015 as well. Relative to what happens to the capacity associated with the Chevrolet Europe volume, most of that came out of Korea. And when you look at what we are doing to fill that and the opportunities to fill it, it\u2019s really with other global products like small SUVs the Encore, the Mocha, the Chevrolet Trax and driving efficiency and continue to drive efficiency in Korea. So this is obviously an ongoing set of actions that the international team are executing to. Colin Langan : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And just last question. Any color on your relative risk to the volatility in currency? I imagine in Europe that actually does help translate some of the losses back to a lesser degree. What about the other inter-regional currency issues that you face? Is that a rising concern, or is it net neutral to your global business? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Clearly, as you saw from the calendar year results, it was a significant headwind in 2014. We are largely able to offset that through pricing and other actions, as we started this year, further weakening of these currencies will again be a challenge. But when I look at it across the globe, I generally -- the transaction impact is offsetting with the exception of the Russian ruble that\u2019s the biggest concern that we have thus far. And the team continues to take actions to offset that. So as I think about it from a big picture perspective, I think we\u2019re in a pretty good position to manage the FX exposure without changing our view of the year. And again, the proof-of-point is we\u2019re able to do that last year and get after it and we\u2019ll do the same thing in 2015. Colin Langan : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Chuck Stevens : Good Morning. Mary Barra : Hello. Emmanuel Rosner : Wanted to ask you first about your mid-term target margin for North Americas, 10% by 2016. It looks like this quarter, a lot of things from execution as well as environment were going very well and you achieved obviously a strong margin in what is seasonally a weak quarter. But it\u2019s still only about 8.7% or so. Can you please remind us the bridge from current levels to 10% by 2016, what are the main buckets there? Chuck Stevens : Yes. Sure. Number one, significant improvement from product and when I talk about product, two different buckets. Product refreshes, so replacement of current models like the Cruze, Malibu, Equinox, Terrain. We indicated back in October that each of those vehicles would be more than a $1,000 per unit more profitable than the vehicles they\u2019re replacing. Next between cost efficiencies, as well as price and then new entries like the mid-sized truck for instance and Cadillac entries that we\u2019ll be adding to the portfolio, which are accretive to volume share and profitability. So that\u2019s the product portfolio piece of it. And then of what we call adjacencies or business model leverage, we think there\u2019s significant opportunity going forward between now and \u201816 and beyond for customer care and after sales expanding our reach in the value chain in the F&I area, OnStar with monetizing 4G LTE. So those are the big drivers of going from -- think about it 2014 kind of ex recalls 9% to 10% in 2016. Those are the big drivers to pickup that net 100 basis point improvement. Clearly, the first two will be more than 100 basis points because we are going to have is we\u2019ve talked about before some overhead headwinds associated with engineering and marketing, but net those out and that\u2019s how you go from 9% to 10%. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. Very helpful. And then just another margin question, but on China this time. Obviously, you are running pretty close to your targeted levels and these are obviously very impressive margins in absolute terms. Yet, I cannot notice that just the ongoing trend I guess over the past four quarters or so is just a sequential decline. And I\u2019m sure there is some seasonality in that as well. But can you just go over again these sort of competitive dynamics and why you wouldn\u2019t expect this to sort of like continue to decline as it has for the past few quarters sequentially? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. I think it\u2019s important there is seasonality in that. If you look at the fourth quarter net income margins this year versus last year, they are up 110 basis points. So 8.7% versus 7.6% from a China net income margin perspective. For the year, we are at 9.8% which is up three times of a percent year-over-year. And as we talked about the dynamics in the China market before and how we are going to maintain 9% to 10% EBIT margins. We indicated that volume and mix would be favorable material performance with partially offset price and we expected kind of fixed cost to increase as we continue to invest. The biggest driver if I net it all that out is really mix and that\u2019s going to be driven in maintaining margins. And that\u2019s going to be driven by nine new SUVs that we are launching and in a process of launching including the Chevrolet Trax, which is doing very well, the Buick Envision, which is doing very well as well as filling out and growing Cadillac. So that\u2019s how we are going to attack and maintain those 9% to 10% margins. Emmanuel Rosner : Perfect. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First I see on slide nine that you call out $0.1 billion of recall-related costs, but I didn\u2019t see that in the press release or in any of your regional year-over-year EBIT bridge slides, maybe because it rounds to less than $0.1 billion in any region. So I\u2019m just curious what that is, whether it might relate to North America, suggesting that your underlying margin there was even higher? Chuck Stevens : It\u2019s primarily legal related expense and that falls into the corporate sector. So for the year and we\u2019ve talked about this before, we expected and actually incurred about $300 million in year-over-year increase in legal expense and that\u2019s one other things that we expect to continue into 2015 as well. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I\u2019m curious on what you are seeing in terms of the impact of lower commodity prices in 2015. Not just in terms of the raw materials that I guess that go into your cars, but also maybe from the perspective of lower diesel prices impacting freight and logistics. How material could that potentially be? Chuck Stevens : Certainly versus our original expectations, it would have -- it would be a tailwind both commodity prices and fuel prices. And when you think about the magnitude assuming that fuel prices to stay with -- for the rest of the year, we are talking $200 million to $300 million at the top end of the opportunity range there Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. And then last question, we saw some headlines the other day about suspending production in Russia, I guess to avoid that ruble to euro transaction headwind that you talked about earlier. So how should we think about -- what that means going forward? And other firms have sometimes talked about like what their unavoidable fixed costs in a country are like in Venezuela, for example. They try to draw the line for the investment community in terms of how bad could it get if there were no corresponding revenue. Anything you can do to kind of frame the situation for us? Chuck Stevens : Sure. If you look at 2014 versus 2013, the net headwind from a Russian perspective and European results was about $200 million on a year-over-year basis. As I think about 2015 the kind of the local fix costs left unattended are about $250 million. So if we produce zero vehicles and generated zero variable profit and took no action, there could be a $200 million to $250 million headwind from a local fixed cost perspective. Obviously, our objective is to offset that to the extent possible with cost reductions, which we continue to do hence the suspension of manufacturing and the 1000 people that we\u2019ve taken out of St. Petersburg but as well as pricing. But just sizing up the kind of potential exposure on a year-over-year basis, Ryan, I would call it $200 million or less. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC. Please go ahead. Joe Spak : Thanks for taking the question. Going back to China first, I know you mentioned the better year-over-year margin. Obviously, we see the whole sales were up as well. Was there any benefit from mix or can you give some color on that on a year-over-year basis? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. The mix was favorable in 2014 versus 2013. Again headline we grew share and profit margins. And one of the reasons we grew share was we introduced a number of new products, especially in the SUV\u2019s segment, where we had to had some gaps from a portfolio on the competitive perspective. And again the same dynamics in 2015 were present in 2014. Volume mix were favorables. The net pricing dynamic in China is and has been a headwind and will continue to be a headwind. Material performance and carryover products partially offsets the net price and generally our fixed costs have been going up as we\u2019ve been expanding in an increasing capacity. But the volume mix impact fundamentally offsetting price and fixed cost. Joe Spak : Okay. In South America, you guys have done a really good job offsetting FX with price. And it sounds like you are going to be able to -- you expect to be able to continue to do that in 2015, I just want to confirm that. And then also related to South America, I was wondering if you had given any thought to -- you mentioned in the media some comments about Venezuela. I was wondering if you gave any thought to deconsolidating those activities such as Ford did? Chuck Stevens : Yeah. Let me talk about the general dynamic in South Africa first. Not only, have we been working hard to offset the impact of FX in economics with pricing but we continue to drive efficiencies throughout the business from a cost perspective as well. I would suggest that generally from a Venezuelan and Argentinian perspective, we can recover any FX movement and any economic impact inflation. And we demonstrated the ability to do that over the past number of years. Brazil is a little bit different dynamic. So I\u2019m keeping a very close eye on what\u2019s happening with the real and our ability to recover that completely. Historically, we haven\u2019t been able to get it completely offset that headwind with pricing. And that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to monitor. Obviously, it\u2019s weaker than what we expected thus far. From a Venezuela standpoint, our facts and circumstances would dictate that currently we control our operations. We have some control over operations. We were able to take advantage of currency releases and participate in the currency markets in 2014 to secure hard currency to order product. We settled and got a labor agreement. And in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve been producing vehicles, producing and selling. And until those facts and circumstances change, we\u2019re in a position where we\u2019re actually controlling the business. But that\u2019s something that we monitor very, very closely. And if those things change, further volatility, unavailability of currency, or otherwise, that\u2019s something we will have to revaluate. Joe Spak : Okay. And then just real quickly, the recall-related legal expense, should that continue -- of $100 million, should that continue for another couple quarters? Chuck Stevens : As I indicated, we incurred roughly $300 million of recall-related legal expenses in 2014. And we would expect that kind of pace plus or minus to continue in 2015. Joe Spak : Okay. Thanks a lot. Chuck Stevens : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And congratulations. Chuck Stevens : Thanks, Itay. Itay Michaeli : Just a couple of housekeeping, Chuck, the $700 million of restructuring expense this year, can you give us a rough breakout of where that\u2019s going to be by region? Chuck Stevens : I\u2019ll give you a general breakdown of that. About something less than $100 million in South America, a range of $100 million to $200 million potentially in North America, and then the vast majority will be in international operations, primarily related to Holden and the previously announced action to cease manufacturing operations and some restructuring activities in Korea associated with alining capacity with demand around the world, somewhat related to the Chevrolet Europe wind down. Itay Michaeli : That\u2019s very helpful. And then you mentioned earlier some of the cadence issues for cash flow, how about EBIT-adjusted, anything special to think about this year? You do have some product launching late in the year. Any tips in terms of modeling the cadence this year? Chuck Stevens : If I was going to model the cadence, I would look at the last two or three years earnings cadence and look at that and Q1 will be generally the weakest quarter of the year. Just based on from a seasonal perspective, Q2 will be the strongest and Q3 and Q4 will be about average. Itay Michaeli : Great. Just lastly, on the free cash flow guidance, just to clarify, are you still looking for about $1 billion of cash restructuring in 2015? I know you mentioned the recalls. I just want to check on the restructuring as well. Chuck Stevens : That\u2019s correct. The $700 million assuming that we execute all these restructurings and actually make the payments in 2015, that\u2019s the assumption, plus the $300 million overhang from 2014. Itay Michaeli : Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks so much, guys. Chuck Stevens : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. Just a couple questions about GM Financial and the strategy, the decision to pull the subvented leasing business for Buick, GMC, and Cadillac back 100% captive and away from Ally. Ally has been pretty critical of the move. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen some of the quotes from their former CEO. I just wanted you to explain again the logic for not giving Ally any chance at all as a subvented leasing alternative, why the exclusives? Chuck Stevens : Yes. Number one, first and foremost, is owning the customer. This is all about customer relationship and driving improves the loyalty. And what we\u2019ve found and I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s specific to Ally, but in other lease providers, at the conclusion of lease their objectives may not be the same as ours. Our objective is to get that person another General Motors vehicle and maintain that relationship and own that customer. So this is 100% around loyalty and customer ownership. Adam Jonas : Okay. That\u2019s clear. And just a second just follow-up, you have been growing your captive finance business very aggressively, both through organic and non-organic means. And some of the non-organic stuff you have done has been acquisitions of some of the former Ally International businesses most recently in China, the JV side of it there. Can you categorically rule out considering adding some of the domestic Ally portfolio if it was offered at the right price? And I say that seeing Ally trading at around 0.7 times tangible book. Thanks. Chuck Stevens : Yeah. I really, I\u2019m not going to comment on that at all. I\u2019m one way or the other, Adam. Adam Jonas : Okay. So that\u2019s not a categorical to rule out. Thank you. Chuck Stevens : No comment. Adam Jonas : I respect that. Thank you. Operator : Miss Barra, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back to you. Mary Barra : Thank you very much, Operator. And thanks everybody for participating on the call and for your questions. As we move forward, you can expect us to keep the same intense focus on results that we demonstrated through 2014. And with this focus, we expect to deliver improved performance in all of our automotive regions this year. It\u2019s key to meeting our 2016 objectives, including the 10% EBIT-adjusted margins in North America, profitability in Europe and continued strong margins in China. And it will also keep us on track to deliver EBIT-adjusted margins in the 9% to 10% range early next decade. Our intention is to increase second quarter -- our intention to increase second quarter dividend is the first step in our goal to maximize long-term shareholder value through both return of capital and stock price appreciation. So now I would close by saying thanks again for your participation. I appreciate your time, and hope everyone has a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remark, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Thursday, April 23, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx : Thanks, operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us as we review the GM\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of 2015. A press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast and the Internet. As noted on our earnings conference call announcement, we are changing the format of our earnings calls. Included in a chart set materials published this morning, we\u2019ve included the key take ways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. Our intent is to have a more efficient call with the majority of time allocated to answering your questions. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors\u2019 Chief Executive Officer will provide some brief opening remarks and then we\u2019ll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Chuck Stevens, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer and Niharika Ramdev, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : I see that everybody being on the call today. I mean if I \u2013 I mean I can look at our Q1, it was very solid performance and was in line with our expectations and we are on track to achieve our 2015 commitments. Really if I look at the first quarter it was another example of doing what we say we\u2019re going to do. Our revenue was about $35.7 billion, our consolidated EBIT-adjusted was $2.1 billion, our earnings per share adjusted was $0.86 and for the first time we\u2019ve shared our ROIC andover the last four quarters it\u2019s nearly 20%, despite the intact of recall. Finally our adjusted automotive free cash flow was in line with our previous guidance and there was an outflow of $1.7 billion due to three reasons, first, an extra supplier payment, two, restructuring payments, primarily [indiscernible] and then recall-related payments that drove the $1.7 billion outflow. Also important to note is immediately we have started the share repurchasing after we made the announcement on March 9. And so through yesterday, we had actually repurchased 20 million shares for about $750 million. And that\u2019s an addition to the stock repurchases, we\u2019ve also returned about $5 million to our owners through the dividends in the first quarter. So again it has been a solid start to the year and we believe it provides a very firm foundation for our 2015 commitment to improve our EBIT-adjusted and also to approve our EBIT-adjusted margins versus 2014. If I just provide a few comments as we go through the world and took at company performance, let\u2019s start with North America. First, our demand for the full-size pickups and SUVs remained very robust. The strong demand for the pickups full-size SUVs and our mid-sized truck help GMNA achieve its seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year EBITDA margin improvement. We also shared some very significant products. In New York we released \u2013 revealed the Malibu, the Spark and the CT6 and we\u2019ve got a very good response on all three of these products the Malibu Spark, again very important segment for us in the car segment. And then with the CT6, it\u2019s very important as it represents a lot of our advanced technology and specifically our material strategy for structures to optimize math, but improve performance. These are very important vehicles that will play a significant role in helping achieve our targets not only for 2015, but for 2016 and they are a part of it. We have more significant launches that we\u2019ll be dealing throughout the year. If I look at China, the industry does remain strong and we expect the auto industry in China to grow about 6% to 8% in 2016. As expected our results for in Q1 were impacted by product change over and launch cost. The product that we are launching is the Buick Excelle and the Chevrolet Sail 3 and also the Buick Envision. And we also launched a new plant the Buick Excelle is built in our new Wuling plant and this plant will have an annual capacity of 240,000 units, so again very important launches that will fuel our results through the rest of the year. In Europe, we had improved year-over-year performance and we\u2019ve reduced losses, despite the headwinds in the Russia market. So our total European sales were up 3.1% versus the industry growth of 2.8% and we improved share in 11 European markets. The demand for the Corsa is very strong and we are seeing the variable profit improvement that we talked before we launch this car, so again very good reception in the marketplace for the Corsa. In South America it remains challenging given the macro economic conditions, especially in Brazil and Venezuela. The company is taking several aggressive actions across all aspects of the business to make sure that we continue to be able to meet our goals. And in GM International, we demonstrated year-over-year performance improvement, we\u2019re narrowing the loss in the first quarter with roughly a $100 million and these are the results of several actions we have taken in the countries that make up GMI. And finally GM financials continue to grow its active presence among GM details and has successfully rolled out the lease capability and exclusivity with Buick, GMC, Cadillac, and Chevrolet dealers. Finally, as you\u2019re aware the company provided details of the disciplined capital allocation, our framework and I hope you see that the actions that we\u2019ve taken to change our business model in Russia, the restructured announcements that we talked about in Thailand, in Indonesia demonstrate that we are going continue to make decisions that allow us to allocate capital to generate the right returns for our owners. If I look at the remainder of 2015, clearly we expect trending robust year-over-year improvement in EBIT-adjusted in our margins in North America, we are on plan to achieve the 10% EBIT adjusted margins for 2015. In Europe, with the improved year-over-year performance expected to continue, we are on a path for profitability next year. And in China, as I already mentioned we expect results to improve when we look at the new products that we invested in this first quarter and the new plant, we\u2019ll continue to see an expansion in Cadillac and then the \u2013 our launch cost and a change over cost that we incurred will be behind us. In GMI, we improved the top line performance and are benefiting from the restructuring and we expect to break-even in performance this year excluding restructuring. And finally in South America, the environment is more challenging and has changed rapidly in this first quarter, but as I mentioned we are taking aggressive actions to mitigate this and we expect to improve our profitability, so we are not changing our guidance for South America at this time. We\u2019ve also are reaffirming our guidance for adjusted automotive free cash flow, which is expected to be flat to slightly up, compared to 2014. So if we look across the business, we are on track to achieve not only our 2015, but our 2016 financial commitments, and 2015 that is to improve our EBIT adjusted in our margins versus 2014 and in 2016 it\u2019s North America EBIT adjusted margins of 10%, but in Europe to profitability and sustain strong margins in China. So with that, I would like to turn it back to Randy, who has been open it up for questions. Randy Arickx : Okay operator we are ready when you are. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache : Good morning everybody, can you hear me? Mary Barra : Hi, Rod. Rod Lache : Hi, couple of questions. First, in North America, I\u2019m hoping you can give us a little bit more color on your pricing expectations kind of that a high level. Obviously, you\u2019re going to start comping [ph] against the strong pricing from the trucks right now. So it looks like the tough pricing on the 700,000 or 800,000 cars and small crossovers that you sell is starting to come through. You did say in your comments that you think that\u2019s going to improve as the cars get renewed. Skeptic would say that improvements in passenger car pricing from new products really, it just won\u2019t lacks very long, because the segments over capacitize in facing currency advantage to competitors. Do you see something different there that makes you feel like that could be sustainably improved once the products launch? Chuck Stevens : Yes, Rod let me talk about Q1 pricing first from a North American prospect and make sure there is some clarity around the $600 million headwind. But first that\u2019s primarily cars, clearly the carryover pricing includes whatever carryover impact there was from full-size trucks and SUV, but that\u2019s relatively marginal. About one-third of that $600 million is retail-related and it\u2019s primarily related to the passenger cars that we\u2019re going to be launching or replacing here over the 12 months to 18 months. About two-thirds of that $600 million is fleet specific and wants a bit of explanation. We\u2019re in a unique situation where we had a significant volume of past model vehicles going to auction in the first quarter of 2015, up about 50,000 units, versus the first quarter of 2014. And this is caused by recall events where we prioritize customer repairs over fleet resulting and carrying inventory longer. So had passed in our vehicles that we carried longer into the cycle and clearly as option values dropped the longer you go in a model that had an impact. Our expectation is it that we\u2019re going to strike a lot of this in the first half of the year. Talking about the year in total, we still expect pricing and retail overall to be relatively flat for the year. Carryover pricing headwinds will be offset by our new major launches later in the year. And a portion of that obviously will be the impact of our next generation products like the Malibu that we\u2019re going to be launching. On the bigger question that you asked on, do we expect pricing to able to hold on new model launches? We have one proof-of-point so far and that\u2019s the Corsa in Europe as an example where we sid the next generation because it\u2019s significantly better vehicle than one it replaced, would generate incremental profitability and thus far that\u2019s holding. When you look at the next generation Malibu we\u2019ve got a larger car than the one that is replacing, you\u2019ve got a car that weighs 300 pounds less and drives significantly higher fuel economy. And our expectation is for that car and others is we\u2019re well over the Chevrolet portfolio that we will be able to hold back price when we have clearly segment-leading vehicles that we\u2019re launching into the market. Rod Lache : The content costs are starting to turn positive here, does that start to moderate when these new launches kick-in, is there significant amount of additional content there? Chuck Stevens : Well, there will be more content in the next-generation vehicles. Based on our assessment we will be able to price to recover that. What you\u2019re seeing especially in North America, but also globally the material performances on carry over models. We have $300 million in the first quarter, run rate that for the rest of the year that\u2019s $1.2 billion, globally. We\u2019re very much on track to that $2 billion of savings that we talked about in October and January from our carry over material performance perspective. Rod Lache : Okay, and then just two more China there\u2019ve been quite a few reports about some softening and deterioration in pricing in the luxury end. You\u2019re not really mentioning that. I was hoping you can comment there. And then lastly, in Europe, last year, you took almost $700 million of restructuring. Assuming that the doesn\u2019t recur and you get some savings from Bochum and from the new products, well, do you think the year-over-year improvement this year in Europe could be greater than that $700 million? Mary Barra : So, first, on the China pricing question, I mean, it continues to be a very competitive pricing environment across all markets. And then we just returned \u2013 we had the whole executive leadership team in China. We\u2019re at the show. I think you\u2019re seeing some very capable OEMs. So, we expect that to continue. And that\u2019s built into the forecast in our plan, so not unexpected. Chuck Stevens : And relative to Europe, as we talked about before, yes we expect to see improvement in 2015 versus 2014 on our path to breakeven. We indicated that it wouldn\u2019t be a straight line, and that the biggest driver of that improvement year-over-year would be the absence of restructuring. I think you\u2019re seeing that play out in the Q1 results, but also, we would have launched costs associated here in the first half year with the Corsa and then the back half of the year with the Astra. And then once we cycled through that and headed into 2016, you would see the full benefit of the Corsa and Astra, which represents about half the volume in Europe really driving improved profitability. Rod Lache : Thank you. Operator : All right. And your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Chuck Stevens : Good morning. John Murphy : Just a first question, Chuck, to follow-up on the hit that you got from the rental car auction number here, it sounds like it was about $400 million. On an after-tax basis, that would be about $0.17 a share if we just applied your tax rate and your share count. Is that about right and that is in the ballpark and that is something you might expect to recur in the second quarter, but then not in the third and the fourth? I am just trying to understand the magnitude of the impact to the bottom line, as well as the reoccurrence or lack thereof. Chuck Stevens : Yes, first, I would start out by looking at overall North American results. And in North America, in the first quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of profitability and 8.8% EBIT margins, which is, again, some straight quarter up 110 basis points on a quarter-over-quarter basis versus the first quarter of last year so, clearly, on the path to 10% margins. If you look at a specific driver of Q1 impact, clearly, the auction impacted our Q1 results. But in the overall framework of North American results, it was offset elsewhere. Yes, we expect to cycle through this as we go through the second quarter, would expect that magnitude of impact to be lower. And then, finally, John, within \u2013 this was not an unexpected outcome from a North American perspective, as we provided guidance for 2015 and looked at our business. But this is certainly an issue that we\u2019re factoring into our outlook, which, once again, higher aggregate EBIT and higher margins in 2015 versus 2014. John Murphy : Okay, but if I am doing my math correctly, absent that, your margin was about 10.4% in North America, which is pretty strong and a little bit better than what you are even talking about getting to. Just kind of backing that out, which it actually happened, so it is tough to back it out\u2026. Charles Stevens : Yes. That... John Murphy : But the ongoing number looks pretty strong. Chuck Stevens : Certainly have a hard time arguing with your math on that one driver of the business for sure. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a second question. I just got back from Shanghai as well and we met with SAAC, as well as VW and they did highlight the risk to pricing, but they also highlighted the fact that you, as well as Volkswagen, as well as most of the international players, are pretty tight on capacity utilization. So it just seems a little bit curious that the pricing is getting pretty weak over there. So just trying to understand, are you seeing the local players becoming much more credible in the market in creeping up and pressuring pricing? I\u2019m just trying to understand where the pricing pressure is coming from with CAPUT that sounds like it\u2019s pretty tight. Chuck Stevens : Yes. And looking at capacity utilization, it\u2019s kind of a tale of two different dynamics. One the foreign OEMs are running 90-plus percent capacity utilization. The locals are running at about 70%. And I would suggest that the capability from a local [indiscernible] and you were there, so you saw it. It\u2019s certainly improving. But the pricing dynamics that we\u2019ve seen and that we\u2019re anticipating this year, negative 3-plus percent net price on carryover, that\u2019s the same dynamic that we saw last year and the year before. The market\u2019s slowing. There\u2019s a lot of competition. It\u2019s maturing. Importantly, what we said, and recognizing that that was a headwind, was our launch strategy, more SUVs coming into the market, Cadillac, and continued cost efficiency was going to offset those pricing headwinds and enable us to maintain margins. And we\u2019re executing that. I\u2019ll give you an example, the Envision. It has just been outstanding performance since we launched that as well as the Chevrolet Trax, and when we look at crossovers and SUVs versus passenger cars, they\u2019re more profitable by $1,000 and $1,500 a car. So, I think the pricing dynamic is going to continue to be challenging. In China, we\u2019re planning around it being challenging, but we\u2019re executing to the plan that\u2019s going to offset that. John Murphy : Okay that\u2019s helpful. Then on free cash flow, negative $1.7 billion. I\u2019m just curious though if you can outline what the exact numbers are for the extra week of supplier payments? And then as we think about the recall and restructuring cash used in the quarter, if you can just of delineate those three items for us just so we can understand. Chuck Stevens : Sure. Yes. The extra payment cycle was worth roughly $1.9 billion, and that\u2019s a typical cycle payment that we have. The recall and restructuring combined about $800 million, $400 million each for the year. What we had talked about before was roughly $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of recall-related cash, so we\u2019re kind of on run rate for that as I think about the rest of the year and restructuring cash payments north of $1 billion for the year. And I think as you run through the rest of the year, that will start to diminish as we cycle through Bolcom [ph] and some of the other ones. But that\u2019s kind of broad strokes, John. John Murphy : So, horseshoes and hand grenades, it was basically more like a $1 billion positive free cash flow quarter if you adjust for those numbers. That\u2019s just our numbers. Chuck Stevens : Yes. If I look at it on an apples-to-apples basis versus the first quarter of last year and excluded some \u2013 the extra payment cycle and the restructuring recall, I ended up with the same math you did. John Murphy : Okay. And then just lastly, the buyback, you guys are being reasonably aggressive in the market and the pay seems to be a lot faster. It seems to be a bit faster than we would have expected. Is there any potential that you\u2019ll blow through this buyback during the course of this year and we seen an up-sizing by the end of this year or the beginning of next year? Chuck Stevens : Well, when we announced the initial share buyback, what we said was within the context of the capital allocation framework, one, we wanted to get to our target cash balance of $20 billion as quickly and prudently as possible. And depending upon other contingencies, unknown issues that could result in acceleration of our share, we\u2019d like to buy back the shares as quickly as possible, but I think you need to factor it into the $20 billion target cash level and how other things develop. We will monitor it, John, very closely on a month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter basis as we go through the year. And another important point, what we said was an initial $5 billion share buyback. So, depending on execution, we would expect this to be the first tranche. John Murphy : Thank you. And what your shares are doing today, it seems like it will be a great time to accelerate it. But I appreciate the help. I appreciate the help, guys. Thank you. Chuck Stevens : As soon as we exit the window period, perhaps. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mary Barra : Good morning. Itay Michaeli : Just want to start with South America. Maybe a little bit more color on some of the actions you\u2019re taking that give you confidence you can still meet the full-year plan. And then, secondly, on the FX hit for the quarter, was that a balance sheet measurement? Want to get a little bit more color on that FX impact. Mary Barra : Sure. If you look at South America, the team has moved very proactively. Looking at all aspects of our cross-structure, there\u2019ll be production cuts. And in line with that, we\u2019ll look at our labor costs, there\u2019s already active programs going on as it relates to our salaried workforce, and the appropriate adjustments will be taken from an hourly as well, and again very significantly. And then, I would say it\u2019s really a detailed approach of looking at every single cost, a zero-based budget approach looking at indirect purchasing initiatives where everything is questioned. So, they have really gone to, I say, a very austerity approach. The other element on the revenue side is the price as appropriate because even though the market has shrunk dramatically, we still have a very strong portfolio, and are getting our share and a little bit higher share growth, it\u2019s just the market is so much smaller. So, they\u2019re looking at every aspect and cost element of the business, building on what they\u2019ve done over the last two years. Chuck Stevens : And on your foreign exchange question, Itay, which aspect are you asking about the impacts on revenue or the EBIT [indiscernible]? Itay Michaeli : The $200 million EBIT, Chuck. Niharika Ramdev : Yes. Fundamentally, that\u2019s transaction exchange. And the biggest driver of that, the ruble in Russia, the real in Brazil. And then, we have a one euro interaction where the euro was weakening faster than the won and we still import a certain number of vehicles into Europe. Largely, on the ruble and real side of it, we\u2019re trying to offset that with price. That\u2019s why you saw that improved EBIT performance on year-over-year basis. But that\u2019s fundamentally worth that. Itay Michaeli : Great. And then a question on the product cycle. One of the increasingly popular disclosures in your 10-K is the variable profit by segment that highlights cars, crossovers and trucks relative to the weighted average. I think it was about 40% for cars last year. As we think about the next couple of years, maybe first do you have an early rough estimate of what that might be this year for cars and maybe where that was historically in the last time you refreshed some of the small and midsize cars? Tom Timko : Yes. We haven\u2019t changed our outlook on that, 160, 140. I believe 2010, 2011 timeframe, it was closer to 50, 100, 150, as we went into that launch cadence of the current generation of vehicles. I personally haven\u2019t looked at the dynamics associated with this as we go through the launch cycle, but I would certainly expect those gaps to narrow on a go-forward basis based on our expectations on the next-generation product. But clearly, trucks and full-sized SUVs are always going to be most profitable, crossovers are going to be close to the average. And passenger cars, on a relative basis, are going to be least profitable just because you have all the small and compact vehicles in there. Itay Michaeli : Great. And I\u2019d love to get an update too, Chuck, on raw material costs. We\u2019ve seen steel prices continue to come down. Any incremental benefit that you might see from raw materials this year and at what point, if raw mats stay where they are today, might you begin to lock in some savings for 2016? Chuck Stevens : Yes, we expect right now, based on our view on raw materials were to be relatively neutral on a year-over-year basis, there\u2019s puts and takes. Steel, resins and other raw commodity prices are down. Aluminum, some rare metals, rare metals are up. And again, you have to look at what\u2019s indexed versus what\u2019s tied to specific supply agreements. But broad strokes, I view that as relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Relative to raw material, I would say this, and we talked about it before. As we were looking at 2015 versus 2014, we thought commodity pricing was going to be a headwind. Now, we view it as more neutral. And I\u2019ve indicated that it\u2019s several $100 million, not billions of dollars but several $100 million of the tailwind. Itay Michaeli : Great. So, that\u2019s incremental. Okay. Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks so much, everyone. Chuck Stevens : Thank you. Mary Barra : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Michael Ward for Sterne, Agee. Michael Ward : Good morning. Mary Barra : Hi. Michael Ward : Thank you for taking my question. Two questions, first on Russia, I think if you include FX, it looks \u2013 sounds like it accounted for about $100 million loss in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the timing of the shutdown and when we might see some of those costs taking out of the pre-tax calculation? And the second thing on GM financial, I assume the equity line that we see now in the GM financial results is from the Chinese joint ventures. Is that joint venture in China similar to the automotive? Is it a self-funded joint venture and it\u2019s an after-tax impact? Chuck Stevens : Okay. Yes. First on Russia. No. That was your math on the $100 million. I would suggest out of the losses in Europe, there\u2019s a fairly significant Russian headwind in the first quarter. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going to provide specifics. But I would suggest as we go through the rest of the year, there\u2019s going to be some roll-through impact in Q2, Q3 and Q4 on a diminishing basis as we wind that operation down and then we should get the benefit absent to those losses in 2016. And on GMF, yes, that equity that\u2019s included in GMF is the joint venture now in China. Michael Ward : Okay. And is that a self-funded joint venture or can they fund themselves? Chuck Stevens : Yes. It\u2019s a self-funded joint venture. And that is at least from the equity perspective after-tax in China rolling in to our equity line in GMF. Michael Ward : And can we expect similar type performance or expect it to grow as it gains some share? Chuck Stevens : Well, our initial view is we would expect that to grow because the market is going to grow and more and more people, as the market matures, are going to start financing vehicles. We\u2019re penetrating right now at about 20% of SGM sales, and we would expect to see it grow over years. So, that\u2019s certainly one of the strategic initiatives that we have. Michael Ward : Thanks, Chuck. I appreciate it. Thanks, everybody. Chuck Stevens : Thanks, Mike. Mary Barra : Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from Matt Stover with FIG. Matt Stover : First question is, during the quarter, you folks announced that you are considering increasing capacity on SUVs in North America. I'm wondering if you could address two things in this. One, what is the scope of the increase that you would envision? And number two, how do you think about this internally increasing the capacity of the product once you are getting such terrific yield when maybe in a longer-term perspective, the regulatory environment that could emerge post-2020, that might make that addition excessive? Mary Barra : Yes. So when you look at the full-size truck capacity, so right now, our primary focus is on breaking bottlenecks, not only in our plants but also in supplier plants to make sure that we\u2019re providing not only the maximum capacity without installing any new brick-and-mortar because I think there\u2019s still a lot that we can do there, but also get the mix to be exactly what customers are looking for. And so, we have a very \u2013 a dedicated team that works on that. We\u2019ve already made tremendous progress. And I know you asked about full-size trucks, I will say though that in mid-size trucks, we are \u2013 because of strong demand for both the mid-size truck and the vans adding the third shift to Wentzville again, focusing on what we can do without capital and spending brick-and-mortar. So it\u2019s really a breaking bottleneck strategy and then the shipped addition in Wentzville. Matt Stover : Do think you could add 10% to the capacity of this facility? Chuck Stevens : Which facility? Are you talking about full-size pickup and... Matt Stover : Full-size. Full-size. Chuck Stevens : We\u2019re running pretty close to max line rate capacity. We\u2019ve got opportunities from overtime perspective. And we will continue to look at efficiencies. At a system level, we\u2019ve got capacity to meet demand from a trucks standpoint, a 17-plus-million industry at a 12.5%, 12.6% segment share. So, I think we\u2019re in pretty good shape overall. And same thing from a full-size SUV, a segment share that\u2019s running at 2.5% to 2.6% of industry. And as Mary indicated, our intention is to not to add necessarily fixed capital investment like brick and mortar. It is really to optimize where we can in the supply base and assembly. With the \u2013 and by the way, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing over the last number of years. No brick and mortar. We add shifts. We continue to drive line rate efficiencies. And we\u2019ll continue to look at that as well. Matt Stover : The second question is on international operations. Over the course of the last few years, you guys have restructured Australia and in this year, Thai and Indonesia. There is one more big operation there that seems to need some fixing. I'm wondering if we should expect to see something in Korea in 2015 or 2016, or is that just a putt that is too long. Chuck Stevens : We continue to work to optimize and drive efficiency in all of our operations. And Korea is one where we have that opportunity on a go-forward basis. In the 2015 plan and in the restructuring that we talked about already included in our plan is a small portion related to Korea on a variable separation program. And that\u2019s just an ongoing activity we do there. But I would \u2013 certainly will not expect any significant restructuring in Korea in the near term. Matt Stover : Okay thanks very much. Chuck Stevens : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Mary Barra : Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : I have a question on mix, both in China, as well as in North America, but starting with China, a lot of the noise that is, I guess, coming out of China now is that a decent amount of the growth in demand comes from the lower end, essentially a recovery in demand at the cheaper or Chinese made minivans or small SUVs. I wanted to know if you are seeing that in your numbers with either Wuling outperforming or the growth of Wuling outperforming the rest of your brands and if that constitutes a negative mix impact that we should look into. And at the same time, I would like an update on how Cadillac \u2013 where you are in the rollout there in terms of volume numbers and if that is offsetting some of the mix impact. Mary Barra : So, let\u2019s start with China and especially, if you look at the lower end, what we\u2019ve seen, first off, we have SGM Wuling, it\u2019s a very, very strong local competitor. And it has successfully shift from not only a leading in commercial vehicles, but also, the launching very successful passenger vehicles. We have the Baojun 730. It\u2019s a MPV in the C-segment. And it\u2019s quickly becoming one of the best-selling models and its segment. And then, we have a very important launch, the Baojun 560 SUV that is very competitive. So, I think when you look at the lower end, our Wuling operations have successfully bridged to where the market is going in and looked out ahead of it and are participating in a leading position. So, that\u2019s from a China perspective, I think, is how we\u2019re seeing that opportunity. Chuck Stevens : Yes. And overall, again, Cadillac, we expect to sell close to 100,000 units in Cadillac this year, up significantly year-over-year in China. And that is part of the overall between the Baojun SUV launches, the SGM SUV launches in Cadillac that we\u2019re going to drag much improved mix, which will offset the pricing headwinds that we talked about before. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then on the North American operations, excluding recall expense, essentially the biggest driver of your year-over-year improvement seems to be the positive mix, which you attributed to full-size \u2013 to trucks in general. When I look forward at your goals for 2016, how much \u2013 do you rely on mix sourcing just as positive as it is now, or if the mix normalized or the markets were normalizing or the competition heating up in some of these full-size segments. Would you still be able to achieve the midterm goals? Chuck Stevens : Right. So, let\u2019s talk about Q1 mix for a second. Q1 mix on a year-over-year basis, very robust and it\u2019s consistent with the EBIT bridge and how we talked about 2015 developing. Q1 specifically, very strong full-size SUV mix. But remember, last year, we were launching the full-size SUV. So, we\u2019re at run right now in Q1 versus Q1 last year. So, that\u2019s driving that big mix number. We expect mix to be favorable as we go through the year, but certainly not at the same level as Q1. Looking forward, in the 2016, the biggest drivers in 2015 to 2016, number one, launching products and segments that we had not historically competed in like the mid-size trucks, like Chevrolet trucks and other products that we haven\u2019t announced yet plus the improved passenger car profitability. So, we certainly don\u2019t anticipate the mix continuing to improve. And I think it\u2019s important also if you look year-over-year ultimately from a volume perspective between full-size trucks and full-size SUVs, they\u2019ll be up but not significantly up on a year-over-year basis. So, again, strong mix in the first quarter, expect that to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. The real driver of catalyst for earnings improvement in our product perspective will be products that we have not sold before plus the replacement of some of our core Chevrolet portfolio. Emmanuel Rosner : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi thanks for taking the call. You mentioned a 20% ROI hurdle as governing some of your strategic actions in recent years, presumably including Australia, Chevrolet Europe, Russia, Indonesia, etc. Now those are places where you are retrenching, right? So I am curious relative to some of the very big investments that you are making like the $12 billion in Cadillac, the $16 billion in China, how you think those investments stack up in terms of return potential. Chuck Stevens : Yes, let me talk about China first because it\u2019s easier. China is self-funded by the joint venture, so we\u2019re not putting incremental capital, and obviously, that\u2019s absence of dividends we could be taking but I would say that China earned significantly higher return on invested capital because they have very strong margins and a relatively low invested capital base. So, I would suggest that that\u2019s very accretive from an overall perspective. The $12 billion for Cadillac, that is a kitchen sink number from an investment perspective over the next number of years. It\u2019s not just capital spend. The actual kind of North American or consolidated operations capital spend portion of that\u2019s about 50% of the overall $12 billion or $6 billion relative to the product portfolio. And our expectations are that we\u2019re going to drive better than 20% returns on Cadillac products as we should. They are more profitable than some of our mainstream products. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That's great to hear. Then just a couple questions on your cost structure in the United States. Firstly, there was a study recently I think by the Center for Automotive Research, maybe you saw it, that concluded GM had the highest hourly wages amongst Detroit-based manufacturers. They suggested one cause was a lower percentage of tier 2 workers. Is that consistent with your understanding? And then secondly, a Ford executive recently commented that they would look to close this year their cost disadvantage relative to Chrysler. Is that an objective and realistic objective of yours too, to get your cost in line with the competition there? Chuck Stevens : One, we are not the most expensive or the highest-cost OEM in the U.S. relative to an average cost per hour, so \u2013 and that\u2019s based on Harbor Report data. Two, our objective, and it continues to be our objective, is to continue to drive efficiency and drive our costs, employment costs closer to the overall competitive benchmark. And we will work very, very closely with all the stakeholders including our UAW partners to try to close that gap, but that\u2019s certainly our objective, and it hasn\u2019t changed within the overall constructive, maintaining or improving our breakeven point in North America. Mary Barra : And we\u2019ve been very clear in all of our conversations that improving our competitiveness is a key item that we\u2019re going to be taking through all of the discussions as we get into negotiations. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Good to hear there too. And then just lastly, Sergio Marchionne commented recently he was looking for a merger partner for Fiat Chrysler and he mentioned your company, amongst a couple others, as potentially being logical. I think the message from you though in recent years is that you don't need to merge with anyone else, you need to merge with yourself and you don't want to distract from that. But I am curious what your latest thoughts are with regards to strategic partnerships, or even more broadly the likelihood or need for consolidation in this industry. Mary Barra : So, specifically, about General Motors, I think, we\u2019ve been very clear. We laid out a very comprehensive plan that takes us through the early next decade with milestones next year and beyond. There\u2019s \u2013 as we communicated, we think there\u2019s tremendous opportunity for us within the business as we look at efficiency measures, as we look at truly achieving the scale that we should have, because we\u2019re already in that top tier of the auto industry among the largest OEMs. So, we have a very well-articulated plan. We\u2019re in the middle of the executing that and we\u2019re not going to entertain anything that distracts us from accomplishing that. So, that is the way we look at it and that\u2019s how we\u2019re executing. If you look more broadly from an industry-consolidation perspective, I mean, there are \u2013 the technologies that we need to invest in from a \u2013 whether it\u2019s from a propulsion perspective, whether it\u2019s some of the new emerging technologies, as we look at connectivity or even different business models as it relates to urban mobility, those are all \u2013 all require investments. We have a plan well in place to accomplish and to be in front of the change that\u2019s going to occur in this industry over the next five to ten years. We\u2019ve already made several significant announcements as it relates to autonomous specifically. And we\u2019re already leading from a connectivity perspective when you look at our deployment of 4G LTE in the United States, which is now moving through Europe and through China. And we have more coming in those spaces, as well. So, I think there may be some need as other OEMs, states, the change that is happening. But again, we\u2019ve got a very well-developed plan and we\u2019re all 100% focused on execution. Ryan Brinkman : Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joe Spak : Thanks everyone. I guess in the past you\u2019ve talked about, as we go forward here, and I think it is embedded in your plan, having to add more and more content to your vehicles and that being a headwind. And I guess in light of some global competitors announcing a significantly lower cost of entry to features like active safety or in some cases even standardizing it, if you think that trend is happening quicker than you anticipated, if it's on pace and also how you are going to respond competitively? Mary Barra : Well, I think if you look at it, you have to look at every vehicle by segment to really understand what the customer is looking for because, I think, the key is getting the right technology and function and features on the vehicle by segment by market. And clearly, in the Shanghai 2015 show that we were just at, there is a lot more content being added, but you\u2019ve got to look at the right content again for the segment. But, I think, again, this is why it\u2019s so important that we continue to execute our strategy. As Chuck mentioned, we\u2019re on track to the $2 billion goal from a material cost. I still think there\u2019s more opportunity as we continue to execute there. Doing that allows us to then have the most efficient cost structure to be able to put the right features and functionality on the vehicles. And that\u2019s our plan. So, we think we\u2019ve got more opportunity in that area. And we\u2019ll continue to work at it. Joe Spak : Okay. Are you surprised at all by I guess the pace that you see some people adding content, or it's sort of in line with what you guys were thinking? Mary Barra : I mean, I think, overall, I\u2019m not surprised by it. I mean, there\u2019s kind of two types of content. There was the content that you have to add from a regulatory perspective, and then there\u2019s the features and functions that, I\u2019ll say, create the customer delight and enthusiasm. And we have aggressive plans for both. I would say the one area where it is moving very quickly is with the domestic OEMs in China, big OEMs , saw that and being very significant. But again, our SGMW, Wuling is right in the middle of that and very much focused on the right content for the vehicles. Joe Spak : Okay. And then obviously the TPP agreement has been in the news a lot and I was wondering if you were willing to say what GM's stance is? Obviously it's important for auto and if you have any insight to how you think it plays out. Obviously it sounds like maybe the Japanese are looking to get some of the tariffs dropped, but in return maybe there's some language there are about currency manipulation. So any color you could provide there would be helpful. Mary Barra : Well, generally, General Motors, as I would \u2013 we believe in free trade. And I think our record evidenced that. Again, as you look at this, the key is in the details, clearly, something that puts some controls from \u2013 currency manipulation are important to us, and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate that and work productively to provide input, because, generally, we\u2019re very supportive of a free trade. Joe Spak : Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Your next question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : I just want to follow-up on some of your comments about executing your plan with a question around plans are set, you execute sort of long-term plans, but the market is evolving very rapidly. So I'd like to get a sense just how you as a management team maybe are making midcourse corrections, maybe specifically around three things that have changed even since the investor day. The first is the collapse in oil prices and the impact on really weakening demand in the North American car market. You already talked about your SUV adds. Second, the deteriorating conditions in Russia and third, how do you pay for the content costs, particularly around connected car, where good news the take rates are accelerating faster than expected? Mixed news is some of the competitors are beginning to price things like 8S quite aggressively? Mary Barra : I didn\u2019t hear your very last comment as you talked about competitors. I\u2019m sorry. Brian Johnson : Competitors price to gain as aggressively [ph], so just things that might have been different than when you \u2013 unless you had perfect foresight \u2013 than when you set out your plan. Mary Barra : Right. But if you could just go through those three items, I think we\u2019ve been very agile in making sure we have the right full-size truck, full-size SUV, midsize truck SUV capacity and capability to put those products in the market and I think you\u2019re seeing us do that. So, we\u2019re going to respond and be opportunistic of what the customer wants to buy. And I have been very aggressive in that space. So, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can adjust there and we\u2019ll continue to do so. As it relates to Russia, we took actions to change our business model in Russia reacting to this situation in the point that we were at again, wanting to make sure we\u2019re staying true to our capital allocation framework and deploying capital where we are committed to generating the return for our shareholders. And then as it relates to content, I mean, especially if you look at \u2013 you mentioned connectivity. There\u2019s also revenue opportunity associated with the connectivity, and I think we are just starting to scratch the surface as we look at additional functions that can be accomplished now that we\u2019ve got the pipe into the car and that ability to communicate. And we have several initiatives of new features and functions that we\u2019re going to be putting that utilize that. So, I think there\u2019s a revenue opportunity there. And then finally, as it relates to the cost piece, again, I think with the \u2013 the plan we have this year for $2 billion in performance, I think we still have more room to go and that\u2019s a GM-specific opportunity that we truly leverage our scale and have the right working relationship with our suppliers across-the-board, longer-term relationships and seize those opportunities. So, I would say \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Chuck, if you have anything to add to those three. Chuck Stevens : And to the cost and continuing to drive efficiency. A few weeks ago, I was in New York and talked about across the broad dimensions of the business where we will continue to focus. And clearly, material and logistics is an opportunity that we talked about, Mary talked about. There are still opportunities to drive productivity and efficiency in manufacturing. And as I indicated, just our productivity on a year-over-year basis from a manufacturing perspective is worth $800 million or $900 million a year. We still are pursuing overhead cost reductions with global business services, our IT transformation that will generate significant savings on a run rate basis. And then to the opportunities with OnStar connected car, again, I said, just as Mary did, that we are just scratching the surface there. But even so, we had $350 million worth of improved profitability built into our plan based on what we have taken advantage of so far, and I think there\u2019s significant upside to that, as well. Brian Johnson : Just final question, could you maybe drill down on that in terms of what has already been realized with that $350 million, what the \u2013 you had some categories in the slide deck, but kind of what is already really set in place to collect versus what is going to require either partners in terms of revenue sharing from apps or changing consumer behavior to realize? Chuck Stevens : Yes. I would like to avoid getting into the details of those specifics and that $350 million improvement. Broad strokes. So, obviously, our agreement with AT&T and revenue-sharing opportunities are, one, avenue of improved earnings. Number two is vehicle health, maintenance and diagnostics and how that can drive improved warranty customer satisfaction on a go-forward basis is another opportunity. And then, ultimately, the application framework and how you deploy that on a business-to-business and business to consumer standpoint is another opportunity. But as I said, we\u2019re just scratching the surface. There\u2019s opportunities to leverage GMF [ph] as we grow them to full captive to link in better with our after-sales operations to drive service retention. So, significant opportunities that we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our final question will come from Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Dan Galves : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First one has to do with the new vehicle architectures, which are really important to the outlook. You have already said that we will have increased content, but you expect to price for that. In terms of like-for-like material costs, how much savings can you achieve from globalizing these architectures maybe from a material cost perspective or engineering savings? Chuck Stevens : Well first, we\u2019re starting to see some of it roll through in last year and this year. Last year, we generated roughly $1.2 billion of material cost performance and carryover, this year, $2 billion. Now with capturing carryover, our recently launched products like the K2XX platform. As we went forward, remember what we said about the Corsa and the Astra and the next-generation Malibu, and he next-generation Cruise that we expect is roughly one-third of the profit improvement in those vehicles on a variable basis to be coming from material efficiency. And part of that is getting more scale and leverage bringing the suppliers in early. So, I believe that there is still significant opportunity on go-forward basis as we execute our vehicle set strategy and ultimately get down to a handful of global architectures, so, more to come on that. But I wouldn\u2019t just size it. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the number ultimately ends up being 2% to 3% of material cost in kind of a run rate basis. Dan Galves : Okay, thanks. And then I have two questions on North America. The first one has to do with truck pricing. Some of the external groups that estimate pricing were reporting pretty large ATP increases on full-size pickups, and particularly the SUVs. Was there evidence in your year-over-year bridge of these increases? I guess was it buried in the $200 million of retail negative, or was this all due to mix or offset by content? And then the second question relates to North America costs. I think in January, you said that overall costs would be up in 2015 where fixed cost more than offsetting the material cost tailwinds. In Q1, you had a benefit of about $200 million from cost. How does that trend in the balance of 2016? Thank you. Chuck Stevens : Yes, let\u2019s talk about general pricing from a pickup, full-size SUV. What we talked about and we\u2019re seeing play out versus a relatively aggressive environment in 2014 is a more moderate pricing environment from a full-size pickup and a full-size \u2013 specific to full-size pickups. With that said, we have taken action already. This year, we have raised prices in full-size pickups and full-size SUVs as we look at the opportunities that are being presented. I would expect on a go-forward basis that we would certainly look towards trying to hold some of that. In other words, kind of the base price increases more than offsetting any increase in incentives. It\u2019s still a bit early in the year. And we actually \u2013 how the market develops, but I\u2019d say overall, the pricing environment is certainly more constructive this year versus last year from a truck and SUV standpoint. What was the second part of your question, Dan? Dan Galves : Just on the costs, between fixed costs in North America or structural costs in North America and material costs. I think you said in January that overall costs would be up a bit. You had a tailwind in the first quarter between these two items. Just wondering how that trends in the rest of 2015. Chuck Stevens : Well, I think the material performance is going to trend pretty close to our performance in the first quarter of the year. For the rest of you \u2013 from a kind of fixed cost perspective, our expectation was that engineering, in events of the product launches and marketing, was going to be up on a year-over-year basis. I would still expect that to play out. With that said, we continue to drive the efficiencies in the other parts of the business from a fixed cost standpoint overhead manufacturing. So, we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. But generally I would say we are very much in line with the guidance that we provided back in October and in January. Dan Galves : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the color and for the new format of the call. Appreciate it. Chuck Stevens : Thanks, Dan. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thank you. So, I\u2019ll be brief here. But I think if you look at it, we had a very solid first quarter. We\u2019ve got a strong foundation to go through the rest of the year. We\u2019re going to continue to build on this positive momentum, and I\u2019ll reiterate that we are on track to achieving our 2015 and 2016 financial commitments. Also, you can see that we are already executing the capital allocation framework, and we\u2019ll continue to do that, as Chuck said, month-by-month to look at what is the right strategy recognizing some of the uncertainties and open items that still need to be resolved. But we\u2019re on track. And we will continue to look to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and the $20 billion balance and then invest in profitable growth opportunities and then return value to our shareholders. So, we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategies. So, we look forward to talking to you at the end of Q2. Randy Arickx : Thanks. Operator? Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2015. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM investor relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast on the Internet. Included in the chart set materials published this morning we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks, followed by Chuck Stephens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. Then we will open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, to assist in answering questions. Now I will turn the call over the Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Randy. Welcome, everyone, to the call. I'm glad you can join us today. I'm really pleased to be able to talk about our second quarter. As we look at it, we have delivered strong earnings growth in the second quarter and we've posted a net income of $1.1 billion and an EBIT adjusted of $2.9 billion. And if you look across our regions from North America, it was strong year-over-year performance in the quarter that was anchored by a record $2.8 billion EBIT adjusted and a 10.5% EBIT adjusted margin. In Europe, we demonstrated a near-breakeven quarter which gives us confidence as we move forward and in China, we continued with strong performance despite, as we all know, a much more challenging market. For the calendar year, we're on plan to increase our earnings and margins and consistent with that, we expect our EBIT adjusted for the second half to be higher than the $5 billion EBIT adjusted we've posted through June. So with this foundation, we're confident in our ability to achieve our 2016 target. To just quickly look at the quarter, our revenue was $38.2 billion, our EBIT adjusted was $2.9 billion and this is the second-highest quarterly result on record. Our earnings per share adjusted was $1.29, up 122% over last year and our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.3 billion, very strong, up from $1.9 billion a year ago. We have also committed that each quarterly broadcast or earnings broadcast we will talk about our return on invested capital. Our trailing fourth-quarter average is 23.4% and I think it demonstrates our disciplined capital allocation is paying off as we look across the globe on how we invest. With our strong performance in the cash we have generated it has enabled us to return more than $3 billion to our owners so far this year through the share buybacks that we announced early this year as well as dividends. And I am also pleased that Fitch reaffirmed our performance by raising GM and GM Financial to investment grade. So before we get into the Q&A, I want to couple with this strong financial performance and just give you a couple of examples of things that we're working on and continuing to do to achieve the strategic priorities that we laid out last year. First, as we look at technology and innovation, we do have a lot going on. One example that I don't think a lot of people know about is we have just completed a ridesharing project at Google's headquarters where we had 50 Chevrolet Spark EVs. We learned a tremendous amount of ridesharing from a whole ecosystem perspective and a lot of those learnings are going into the CarUnity car sharing app that is being launched with Opel in Europe which allows consumers to rent their vehicles to others. So that's just one example in what the urban mobility space, as people call it. From a connectivity space, we continue to grow OnStar and 4G LTE and we have over 1 million vehicles on the road today with 4G LTE. We will also see OnStar enter Europe with the launch of -- when we launch the Opel Corsa and with OnStar we'll enter Brazil as we launch the Chevrolet Cruze. I think another important area in this space is with our GM smartphone integration technology. It allows your smartphone, whether it be Apple or Android, to project certain things that you are very used to using on your phone on to the car, not everything, but some key areas. This is really listening to customers and putting them at the center. And you are going to see us expand this to global markets very quickly. So I think you can expect to continue to see General Motors be very aggressive when we look at the technology and innovation we're bringing into the vehicle and for the whole ownership experience. Let's move to another one of our strategic priorities or actually two, earning customers for life and building strong brands. Let me just give you a couple highlights here. From a quality perspective, North America we won four J.D. Power initial quality segment awards for the Chevrolet Malibu, Equinox, Silverado light-duty truck and the Spark and Chevrolet had 10 models in the top three of their segments. Just this week they also announced the J.D. Power APEAL Study. Again, we [Technical Difficulty] performance with four segment award winners and demonstrating continued improvement. From a sales momentum perspective, with Chevrolet and GMC full-sized pickups that momentum was continuing. Share was up to 38.5% for the quarter and that is a 2.9% year-over-year improvement. We also revealed additional products with the 2016 Chevrolet Cruze, the Camaro and the Camaro convertible and they all received very positive reviews with those vehicles. In China, we achieved record first-half retail sales of 1.7 million vehicles and we gained market share. I think it's very important and I know we will have the opportunity to talk more about China as we go through the call here, but very important an 83% increase in SUV sales and record sales for Buick, Cadillac and our Baojun brand. And just an interesting fact with the Baojun brand and this actually is a launch that is in July, so third quarter. But the Baojun 560 which is an SUV, within the first 24 hours of launch we had 15,000 orders. Again, we will talk more about China, but some important progress was made in the second quarter. At GM Financial our North America retail penetration grew to almost 30%, up from 10% a year ago and it's important to note the second quarter marked the first full quarter in which we have positioned GMF as our exclusive lease provider. So I think it demonstrates we're well underway with the GMF strategy that we have outlined. As we look at driving core efficiencies, you will see through the deck and also in the comments that Chuck and I will make as we go through the Q&A, there has been a lot of work done just to continually have discipline in driving efficiencies into every aspect of our business. But another way to drive core efficiencies is partnering. A very good example of that is a recent agreement with Isuzu in the U.S. to produce the low cab forward trucks for Chevrolet and this will begin next year. This is really important because it gives us a broader suite which is very important for the commercial customers that they want one-stop shopping. So have this not only as an opportunity to have this truck, but also we believe will help us sell more full-size pickups. So before I turn the call over to Chuck, I would like to spend a minute or two talking about our 2016 targets. We believe the results in the first half of the year demonstrate that we're on track to achieve the 2016 commitments we have made. If you look at North America, our potential for achieving a 10% EBIT adjusted margin in 2016 is evidenced not only by what we did in Q2, but with eight straight quarters now of year-over-year margin expansion. And on top of that we've got some important launches. We also project that there will be continued high demand for trucks and SUVs and our three-truck strategy is reaping strong benefits. That is even before the refreshed Silverado and Sierra pickups with new powertrain enhancements hit the dealerships later this year. As we look at 2016, our launch schedule again is aggressive. We will have replacements for the high-volume Chevrolet Cruze and the Chevrolet Malibu. And remember, as we talked about, those have an estimated variable profit improvement of about $1,500 per unit. When you talk about Europe and achieving our goal next year to have breakeven performance, again we're getting closer to that goal. With the Astra launch later this year, we will have full availability of both our high-volume Corsa and Astra in 2016. And to look at that, those two models represent about 50% of our volume in Europe. And, again, we expect that the estimated variable profit improvement will be about $900 for the Corsa and about over $1,200 for the Astra. Chuck is going to talk about China a bit more, but I want to make a couple points. First, we expect a more volatile market in China as growth moderates. It hasn't changed our long-term view of China. We continue to believe that the market will grow. There's estimates to about 35 million units over the next 10- to 15-year period. We're well-positioned right now in that market and we want to continue to be well-positioned to capitalize on that growth. We have a very strong partner with SAIC. We're seeing the benefits of what we're doing with Cadillac and the growth -- even additional growth. We have substantial growth opportunities with the Cadillac brand and you will see across all of our brands we're going to continue to have a very aggressive product cadence. Having said that, though, I think as we look at a market as it rapidly matures we need to look at other ways to continue to drive performance. And in China we're also doing that the captive finance capability that we're growing, our increased after sales and OnStar. Again, we're going to look at multiple ways to continue to drive the momentum in China, recognizing that there has been a change. In summary, a very strong quarter with an EPS adjusted of $1.29. We're confident as we execute through this year and into next year. I will look forward to your questions, but right now I'm going to turn it over to Chuck. Chuck Stevens : Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a couple of minutes this morning to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first-half results. In addition to a great second quarter, we also had a very strong first half for the company. Profitability EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $5 billion, up $600 million year-over-year when adjusting for the impact of recalls last year. And, importantly, EBIT-adjusted margins for the first half were at 6.7%, up 110 basis points year-over-year, again adjusting for the impact of recalls. Great results and results that are very much on plan. The results were broad-based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year. And although we're very pleased with the strong performance year-to-date, we continue and will continue to take actions to further position the company for long-term success. For example, the second quarter included a $300 million asset impairment charge for GM Thailand. This charge was largely related to ongoing strategic actions to reconfigure and restructure our business, including focusing on core truck and SUV business in Thailand. We believe that these actions will position the country for long-term, sustained profitability and drive return on invested capital to the target levels that we want to achieve. The restructuring action in North America announced during the quarter is another example of us reconfiguring the business to improve our long-term profitability. I would like to spend a few minutes on China. By far, that is the biggest concern being raised by our investors and the biggest concerns are around, obviously, the moderating growth in China and its potential impact on GM. So let me provide some commentary on that topic. At the beginning of the year, we had a really planned for some industry moderation and increased price competition. Our initial assumptions as we entered 2015 were 6% to 8% industry growth overall and 3% price deterioration on a year-over-year basis. It has been clear to us for some time that the moderation is stronger and the pricing environment more challenging than we anticipated. However, I think it's important that despite these developments, we generated very strong performance in the second quarter and the first half of the year. $1 billion in equity income in the first half of the year with 10.1% net margins which represents margin expansion on a year-over-year basis and a much more difficult environment in China. We were able to generate these results specifically because we had been very proactively managing the market risks with several actions, such as further optimizing mix by increasing productions of our SUVs. Mary mentioned year-to-date SUV sales are up 83% versus 2014. The teams in China have been aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost-down/efficiency-up initiatives and we have been working closely with our dealer body to manage inventory levels. Clearly, on the back of these proactive measures, based on the results that you saw in the second quarter and the first half, we were able to offset market and price pressures to continue to deliver strong earnings. I think it is important also to point out that GMW's Baojun portfolio continues to expand and that provides General Motors with a unique opportunity in the China market to compete strongly with domestic OEM portfolios and particularly in the Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and particularly in the fast-growing SUV and MPV segments. Looking forward, we're expecting continued moderation of industry growth and we expect the macroeconomic volatility to continue. Frankly, based on the current environment, we now expect the industry in China to grow for the full year in low single-digit range versus 2014. And despite somewhat anemic growth in the first half of the year, from an industry perspective around 1%, our low to mid single-digit growth forecast is underpinned by several factors. First, the launch cadence by several OEMs, including General Motors, that will introduce new models in the second half of the year which should spur demand. Next, seasonality. Typically the second half in China is the stronger half, driven by national holidays in the fourth quarter of the year. And then, finally the potential recovery from the current reaction to the volatilities in the stock market. Clearly, June and thus far in July there's been pretty significant headwinds on a year-over-year basis. We don't anticipate that that is going to continue through the year, but that is something we're going to have to monitor. Despite our revised industry outlook, we expect to sustain our first-half performance throughout the rest of the year. Specifically, increase market share and similar equity income levels. There are a number of drivers that give us confidence in our outlook which include our new launches, like the Buick Verano and Baojun 560 SUV that Mary mentioned, continued success of the Envision which is exceeding our expectations and continues to grow on a year-over-year basis, and further growth in Cadillac. Second, improved mix again driven by recently launched products like the Buick Envision, the Baojun 730 and the Baojun 560. Again, as we mentioned, SUV sales are up over 80% year-over-year and the Baojun brand sales are up 370% on a year-over-year basis. Third, further cost actions and efficiency improvements. I think the team demonstrated in the first half of the year the ability to be agile and address headwinds and actively, proactively mitigate those. Again, based on our results. I think it's also important to remember that our first half results and we talked about this in the first quarter -- were negatively impacted by plant downtime and launch costs ahead of new product introductions. We also recognized one of the areas causing elevated concerns in China relates to pricing and let me provide some context in how we think about that as it relates to GM. As I mentioned before, in the past we had experienced carryover price reductions of about 3% on a year-over-year basis and generally we were able to largely offset that through material cost performance. For 2015, given the increased pricing pressures, we're expecting price reductions in the 5% to 6% range, give or take and obviously this is something we will monitor closely. As a general rule of thumb, a 1% carryover price reduction at SGM is worth about $100 million of equity income for GM, absent any mitigating actions. And I think that's important, absent any mitigating actions. Similar to Q1 and Q2, we will continue to look for opportunities and we plan to find opportunities to offset those price headwinds, including improved mix and cost efficiency. As I mentioned, you'd expect the team is working hard on the cost side to ensure we protect our profitability. We're highly focused on that. So bottom line, we recognize the market has become more challenging, but we're confident in our plan and we're taking the necessary actions to help mitigate these headwinds. Finally, with regard to our total company outlook for the balance of the year, we're very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2014, very much on plan in the first half. This will translate into EBIT adjusted north of $10 billion on a total company basis and our expectations are the second half is going to be greater than the first half. And there will be assuredly puts and takes versus our original expectations as we move through the year. There have been already puts and takes versus our original expectations, if you look at South America and some other developments, but, overall, we expect a very strong outcome for the company for the full year. So that concludes our opening comments. We will now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call, thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache : Was hoping you might just clarify a few things for us. One is, Chuck, that 1% is about $100 million. Last year that was a $44 billion revenue business unconsolidated, so I would think that 1% is over $400 million and we might get half of that. So what are we missing there? I would imagine that your fixed costs is up a little bit just given the increasing capacity. Can you maybe comment on maybe what the sensitivity is for every 1% movement in volume for you, just given how your mix has shifted today? Chuck Stevens : Yes, let me talk about the price first. The price and the price impact is largely isolated to SGM. Given SGMW's position in the market, their strength in the commercial vehicle segment, we're not seeing the same kind of headwind. It's really around SGM, so I think that carves off a piece of the $44 billion. Secondly, that is carryover price. So, similar to all other markets, as we launch new products they are not faced with a year-over-year price impact. So that would be the other driver of that, Rod, why that is $100 million versus just taking 1% of $44 billion. I hope that answered your question. Clearly on your fixed cost side, yes, as we mentioned in the first quarter and even in the first half, there's some incremental costs around manufacturing associated with the launch, incremental D&A, but there's still opportunities to drive improvement in fixed costs in indirect, in SG&A, in driving overall efficiency. And that is what the team is very focused on in China. Again from an overall industry perspective, it really depends on ultimately how that plays out. Our view right now is that in that low single-digit growth in industry, we will see a reasonable improvement in passenger vehicles and more headwinds in commercial vehicles in the context of that overall. So that has a bit of an impact on muting the impact on our overall results. My perspective, Rod, when looking on a year-over-year basis, the biggest risk to us or the biggest risk from a China perspective is really pricing more than industry when we look at the overall picture. Rod Lache : What's the sensitivity for a 1% move in volume? And can you give us maybe a little bit of insight into? You mentioned two sources of growth. One is the Tier 2 through 4 regions and some of it is coming from the new product. What is the exposure today to Tier 2 through 4 and what kind of volumes would you expect from some of these new products? Chuck Stevens : If you look at our overall volume in China, roughly half of it is SGM and half is Wuling, broad strokes. And within Wuling is Baojun, so the vast majority of Wuling sales are in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and Baojun brand is up 370% year-over-year. So that kind of gives the idea of the opportunity that we have in those cities and the expected improvement there. The pressure in the Tier 1 cities is really where the foreign OEMs dominate. That's where the price pressure is and that's where some of the volume pressure is as well. Rod Lache : So what is the sensitivity for a 1% move? Is there a rule of thumb that we could use? Chuck Stevens : I would think, if it translated into a full dollar of revenue it's going to be kind of similar to the price sensitivity. Hard to look at that without factoring in mix and I can't come up with a general rule of thumb, Rod, on that because there's different drivers. It depends again where that 1% would fall. Rod Lache : Okay, one last thing, if I may. I know I'm taking too much time here. But in North America you are doing some pretty impressive margins, especially in light of the fleet pricing and restructuring costs and recall that you had. There are a number of things that you have said before that are in your control, like product material cost declines and some of that seems to be coming through. What should we be thinking, if you can just refresh our memory, in terms of the cost reduction expectation, net cost reduction for this year and next in North America? Chuck Stevens : I will talk about material costs on carryover thus far and overall [indiscernible]. From a corporate perspective, we generated about $1.1 billion of year-over-year improvement, roughly $600 million to $700 million of that was in North America. Our expectations would be we would see that continue into the second half of the year. Overall fixed costs, again from a company perspective, year-over-year look to be relatively flat to slightly up. We continue to drive a lot of efficiency with operations excellence. So overall cost, again excluding the material costs on new major kind of product programs, will be down, from a material cost perspective, relatively flat fixed. And I think that is also consistent for North America. Rod Lache : Same cadence into next year? Chuck Stevens : We will talk about next year when we come out and talk to you in January. Operator : Your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Just a first question on slide 14 on North America. I think you guys had alluded to about a $300 million hit in auctions for some recall action, similar to what we saw in the first quarter where it was a little bit larger. If we were to back that out, that would probably add about 1.1% to the 10.5% that you guys printed. Is that about right, Chuck? Is that where you shake out? Chuck Stevens : The math is correct, John. When you look at just that driver of the business, look, the results in North America, 10.5% margins. I think margin speak for themselves and clearly one of the headwinds that we had to offset in the quarter was that auction issue and the loss at auction issue on fleet. But as we move through the rest of the year there will be puts and takes as well, but clearly the core operating performance in North America was very strong in the second quarter. John Murphy :  I'm just trying to understand, if we were to back out those recall actions, as well as the restructuring, you probably would've been doing more like a 12.4% margin in North America. Obviously, there will be puts and takes as we go through the rest of the year and go into 2016, but I mean the ongoing underlying performance is even stronger. Although 10.5% is impressive, it looks like the underlying performance is even stronger than what is generally perceived and I'm just trying to make sure we understand that right. But I think that's kind of about where the math shakes out. Chuck Stevens : I certainly wouldn't dispute your math. My message would be first half of the year North America generating 9.7% EBIT margins which to me demonstrates that we're very much on the path to a sustained 10% margin objective in 2016. So we're very pleased with the results so far. John Murphy :  Okay. And then just a quick second question, if we think about South America, a 23% drop in volume, yet there was almost no change in EBIT. I'm just curious, for that EBIT line to turn in the right direction, what would it take. Because you are holding the line on a 23% drop in volume, could we be seeing some small conservation coming from South America on a very small volume recovery? Chuck Stevens : This goes back and we've talked about this before. This goes back to the actions we started to execute in 2012 and have been consistently executing and that is to continue to drive efficiency in the business model in South America. And the team in South America did an outstanding job earlier this year when we saw the industry performance and the growth and some of the headwinds in Brazil specifically but now kind of spreading through the rest of the region, took very, very proactive action. We talked about that a bit with the Q1 release. We've cut our workforce, hourly and salaried, by 20%. We're going to see the benefit of that in the second half of the year and going into 2016. Frankly, I would expect for South America to see second-half results kind of similar to last year which is relatively close to breakeven, even under the current economic situation. Hard to predict what's going to happen, but under the current economic situation I think you're going to see kind of the same cadence as last year. And my take away is we're highly leveraged to any recovery in South America and I think the actions we have been taking over the last few years will put us in position to quickly get into a positive profit position there. John Murphy : Similarly on Europe, it was a good performance but there's a product launch in the second half of the year and maybe some more restructuring that might go on. How should we think about the remainder of this year? Because it looks like you are getting to breakeven already and just curious if you could hold the line on that in the second half or are there other events that might change the picture there. Chuck Stevens : Again, second quarter results is another proof point that the underlying business has the capability and we're very much on track to our 2016 commitments. Typically, if you look at Europe seasonally, Q3 is generally weaker than the second quarter just because there's broad-based shutdowns across the whole industry and all the countries. So seasonality would suggest some headwinds in the second half versus the performance in the second quarter. And as we talked about, big launch with the Astra, so there will be some launch-related costs, both manufacturing and potentially marketing, as we tail out of the year. But for me it was very, very promising and very optimistic based on the results in the second quarter that we're developing and executing to our 2016 commitment. The results are starting to be a proof point around that. John Murphy : And then just lastly on the buyback program. I just wanted to make sure you guys have a 10b5-1 program in place so you can buy through the blackout period. Also, is that runoff sort of a grid or is there a real program in place so when the stock drops there is significantly more buyback? Just trying to understand how that program is being run and if there's any blackout period or you can just run straight through the quarter. Chuck Stevens : We have a 10b5-1 program. It will run through the next window which will open somewhere around July 28. We do have somewhat of a built-in flexibility where we can increase the amount of shares that we're buying within that program depending on the performance of the stock. Overall on stock buyback, consistent with the commitments that we made when we rolled out the capital allocation framework, we've been aggressive. We've been aggressive within the overall objective to drive our target cash down to $20 billion, bought back $2.1 billion thus far of a $5 billion program and we're going to, as aggressively and prudently, as possible continue to act because clearly our stock is undervalued. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : In China can you give us a sense? You commented on retail versus wholesale in the quarter in the comments, but just how that breaks up from brand and any visibility you can give us into dealer inventory. Chuck Stevens : What clarity are you looking for on retail versus wholesale by brand, Brian? Brian Johnson : Which brand? Yes, in the second quarter which brands did wholesales run ahead of retail? Where did it lag and just how are you thinking about that balance between the two? Chuck Stevens : If I look at quarter-over-quarter broad strokes in the second quarter, retail was down slightly 1.4%, wholesale was up slightly 1.4%, so reasonably balanced. Where we're seeing good performance on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter on retail, importantly Cadillac and Baojun and in SUVs which are up north of 80%. And that same dynamic holds on wholesales. But from a dealer inventory perspective, clearly at the end of second quarter as sales kind of trailed off our inventory picked up. We're not way out of range of our target that picked up about 20,000 units and we will work as we go through the second half of the year to make sure we align supply and demand. We want to make sure that we proactively manage that with our dealers and we have been doing that in the first half of the year, so a little bit out of balance at the end of the second quarter but not significantly. Brian Johnson : Okay. Second question on China, you have talked about new GM kind of operating models and the discipline we're seeing coming through in North America and Europe. How is that different in China, given the JV structure? And then how do you -- in terms of the cost reductions you need in light of the deteriorating pricing situation, just how quickly can you get your JV partner on board with some of those moves and how does it actually work? Mary Barra : I think it works very well. The partners work day-to-day, even the -- the senior leadership of the team is very close to our SAIC partners. And so we very proactively, as we started to see things change, together worked to look for efficiencies, looked to seize opportunities in the SUV market. Again, with the portfolio that we have. We just launched the 560 which is a very important product for Baojun, an SUV. So from the portfolio to managing mix to looking for opportunities, we work on an integrated basis day-to-day with a very strong relationship, so there's no extra hurdle there to go after that. Brian Johnson : Are you able to move quickly should you need to adjust staffing levels? Mary Barra : I'm sorry, I didn't hear the question. Brian Johnson : Would they be able to move quickly to adjust staffing levels or [indiscernible] enterprise to other barriers there? Chuck Stevens : SAIC is a great partner and very, very commercially minded, so -- and we have demonstrated that. We have regular meetings, they were just in Detroit early in June for the SGM Board meeting and we were there in April, so we're totally aligned on where this business needs to go. Mary Barra : What I would also say is, in addition to having a great relationship with a partner where we aggressively look at the challenges in the marketplace and how to manage the business appropriately, our head of China, Matt Tsien, was in town last week. And Chuck, myself, Dan and others spent an incredible amount of time making sure we have a good read of what's happening, what to expect and the actions we need to take again to stay in front of it. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then final question, North America. Just a little bit of rental car accounting. Wholesales were ahead of production. Was that the return of the rental car? Did that actually contribute to EBITDA net of the price impact or was that kind of a wash? Chuck Stevens : Well, you're right on the first part, wholesales being greater than production largely was driven by auction disposals of rental vehicles. Generally, if you look at the overall EBIT impact, the rental vehicles don't contribute a lot to the bottom line so that extra wholesale was not real accretive to earnings in the quarter. In fact, obviously the auction loss had a bit of headwind impact for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Just a question on China again. Chuck, with the outlook I think for kind of flattish equity income second half of the year, what does that come to in terms of the China margin for 2015? And then any updated thoughts around the prior 9% to 10% mid-decade and beyond targets that I think you talked about for China at the investor day? Chuck Stevens : So our outlook for the year, you're right with the math once again that it's going to be -- sustained performance in the second half of the year would put our equity income in the range, give or take, of $2 billion. We have not moved off of our margin objectives in China of 9% to 10% net margins. First half of the year we generated [Technical Difficulty] percent, so we're not moving off that. And we have not moved off our longer term guidance, mid-guidance on continuing 9% to 10% margins. Clearly, we will continue to closely monitor the market in China. We will closely monitor the developments through the rest of this year and potential implications over the next couple years, but we haven't changed our view either on this year or going forward yet. Itay Michaeli : And then just moving along to Russia. Any update on how that wind down is going, maybe how we should think about roughly modeling that into 2016? Chuck Stevens : The execution is going very well, very much according to plan. And as I talked about in Q1 when we announced this, I would expect the impact of Russia and European results to diminish as we go through the year. And, frankly, looking at Q3, Q4 it's going to be relatively immaterial based on our current view. So we will have wound through those implications as we finish the sell down and the regular commercial operations that are still impacting EBITDA adjusted. Itay Michaeli : And then just last question on CapEx and cash flow, it does seem like CapEx is running I think below the original guidance for the year. I know you got some product launches in second half of the year, but love an update there. And also you're still looking for free cash flow to be kind of flattish this year versus last year. I'm not sure if there is an update there as well. Chuck Stevens : Sure. Capital spend first half of the year $3.4 billion which was relatively consistent with last year first half. We've got pretty significant launches as you think about the rest of the year, Astra, Cruze, Malibu. We certainly expect capital spending and the cash associated with that to increase in the second half of the year. We're not moving off of our $9 billion guidance for the year yet, Itay. We will continue to monitor that as we go through the year. As I talked about free cash flow before, I said flat to slightly up. Based on the performance we've seen so far, I wouldn't necessarily change that perspective, but I might underline or emphasize slightly up on a year-over-year basis. Our performances on cash flow is a bit ahead of plan, so we're optimistic that we will be able to do better than we anticipated, but we're not changing the overall guidance yet. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Maybe just to hone back in on China again, but kind of dovetailing on that earlier South America discussion. You have proven very skilled at taking out cost in South America when volume declines and the team there is clearly very used to that. But in a downside scenario in China, what do you think decremental margins look like? I don't know that there's really a precedent that we can point the investors to. So I'm curious whether you engage in the type of downturn planning in China like I know that you do in North America. Any color would be helpful whether regard to flexibility of labor, ability to re-time the capacity expansion, stuff of that sort in the off-chance that we do see not just a slowing but, in fact, a real potential downturn. Chuck Stevens : First, as Mary mentioned earlier, Ryan, we continue to expect China to grow. We haven't changed our long-term view of China to be somewhere in the range of $35 million and we're not the only ones that do that. Yes, clearly we look at downturn scenarios. We look at potential implications that growth isn't as aggressive as we thought it was and in a rapidly maturing market there's going to be increased volatility. We're not anticipating a year-over-year sales decline yet, but clearly that is something that we model and we look at the opportunities to offset that and what that would be. I'm not ready to share that at this point in time, but we do that across the whole company across all the regions. I would say that we have not moved off our guidance for the year and we have not moved off our 9% to 10% guidance for 2016 and beyond at this point in time. And, as I mentioned earlier, we will continue to monitor the situation there and if something changes then we will communicate it appropriately. Ryan Brinkman : And then how do you think GM is positioned in China relative to some of the changes taking place in the market? You talked about the trend toward SUVs and CUVs. What about the trend toward a greater portion of the sales taking place in those Tier 3, 4, 5 cities or interior of the country, away from sort of Shanghai where you are really, really strong? Perhaps you can share are you building out your dealer network any differently? Did you already anticipate these changes? What are you doing to remain as successful in China as you have been but in a different environment? Mary Barra : I think if you look even a couple years back, I think the SGMW team was very good at looking to see the shifts that were coming with the creation of the Baojun brand and then not only passenger vehicles from the commercial vehicles that they are so good at building to the SUVs and with the MPV that we will rolled out and now the SUV that coming out. So I think it was anticipating where the market was going and that something also, with the partner and the senior leadership. We look and try to look over the horizon to see where the market is going to be, where the opportunity is. Then that is a very capable team from an execution perspective. They have a very good, strong brand reputation across the country. If you look at this Baojun 560 SUV, it has I would say, some pretty substantial technology in it when you look at connectivity, when you look at crash, when you look at the material strategy with high strength steel. So I think we're very well-positioned and I think somewhat uniquely positioned in that we have such a very important partnership with a very strong domestic maker in the China market. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. And then just last question. I know you are often limited in what you can say relative to labor negotiations, but I would just observe that it seems like you announced in 2Q a tremendous amount of investment in jobs and factories in the United States. And I couldn't help but notice that these were ahead of, rather than in conjunction with, the labor negotiations and sort of stood in contrast to Ford which actually during the period of time that you were making these announcements, talked about moving small car production to Mexico. So maybe you could just comment as to whether this is a reflection of your strong relationship with UAW that you don't need to tie these negotiations in conjunction -- these announcements in conjunction with the negotiations and that you do expect a good outcome with the partners that maintains or even enhances your competitiveness? Mary Barra : Again, I'm not going to comment on the specifics, but I think when you look at it, we're working with the UAW and having conversations on a daily and weekly basis. And so we're going to look at where we have capacity announcement expansion, new product investments to make and we look at doing that at the right time. It's a continual cycle. I would say one of the takeaways is it's a continual discussion, and I think we have improved the relationship and both parties work hard to do that. That is not to say that there is not issues that we have got to solve. We're actively working and doing that and using our creative and constructive problem-solving to look at the issues and find the right solution that is going to be good for the company and help us improve our competitiveness, as well as be something that is good for the workforce because the UAW, as you step back aside from the negotiations, we work jointly together on safety and I think our safety leadership represents that, the quality work we're doing. And we're taking that to the next level. When you look at the scheming that we have done our plants to be able to get more midsize trucks and every single full-size truck and SUV out, again that's doing that in partnership. So that is the fundamentals of the relationship. We'll work through the issues. Again, we're constantly talking so it's not as it may have been in the past that it's saving things up for the negotiation. But I don't want to underemphasize that we do have some important work to do and we're on it. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault : A couple of China questions and then one kind of broader product question. Just I think it was hit on a little bit in Ryan's question, but the mix impact, how we think about it net-net some of the trends that are going on? It's obvious that you are having a lot of success in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where Wuling and Baojun are doing very, very well, right? But on the flip side, you have the more traditional SGM products that are more coastal that one would think are higher margin -- they are certainly higher revenue -- that are flattish and down in certain months. And then I guess overlaying that you have this SUV trend. So I'm just trying to think as we -- forgetting about cost saves for a second, just as we think about the variable implications of those trends, where does that push margins as we go forward? Chuck Stevens : And let's bifurcate just a bit between SGM and SGMW and we talked about it before when we talked about 2015 and what we expected to do. Pricing headwinds -- and, clearly, they are more challenging than we thought -- would be offset by mix, mix driven by SUVs and Cadillac growth. We're seeing both of that in the SGM channel, the growth in SUVs up 80% and Cadillac is up year-over-year. We always looked at that not only for 2015, but beyond as a way to continue to maintain the margins in China. SGMW, I think you have two implications. You have the passenger car growth in the Baojun brand that is really going to help us in Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities and you have SUVs. And the SUV market is split between kind of premium SUVs, like Buick Envision, the Trax as an example, Encore and other products sold in the Tier 1 cities and the lower cost SUVs which are a big growth dynamic in Tier 2 and 3 and 4. So SUVs apply to both Tier 1 and Tier 2, 3 and 4 cities. Cadillac applies to Tier 1. That mix is what is going to help us maintain those 9% to 10% margins, assuming conditions normalize as we expect they will and get back on a growth trajectory in China. Patrick Archambault : Okay. It sounds like, despite the fact that some of the local-oriented stuff is doing way more than you would have thought, it's still within the realm of being able to stick with that mix statement. One other question, just the impact of credit in China. I take it that's captured in GMF rather than in your China operating segment. Have you guys kind of disclosed an order of magnitude there? Because I can imagine that that is probably starting to get important. Chuck Stevens : On the finance company equity income? Patrick Archambault : Correct, yes. Chuck Stevens : Yes, that will be in GM Financial's results and it will be GM Financial's results that they publish later today. Broad strokes, it's about $25 million of benefit in the second quarter on our equity share in GMF. Patrick Archambault : And then, Mary, maybe more of a product question. There is no question that from a technology perspective there's a tremendous amount happening, everything down to the 4G LTE stuff that's being rolled out aggressively to the Super Cruise for next year. But there has been a lot written in the last week actually just about some of the security concerns and so I was just wondering how you were thinking. You guys probably have the most aggressive rollout of connected cars of almost anybody and was wondering just how -- what kind of security protocols you are able to put in place to make people comfortable that those risks are manageable. Mary Barra : Good question and it's something we have been working on for a couple years now and very actively in the way that we look at the whole system and the levels. Really when you look at cyber security you've got to look at levels of security, because you look at vehicles on the road today, they are on the road for 11 years. And so as we move into a world that has more connectivity you've got to make sure not only do you have many layers of protection in the design of the vehicle, but then also what's very important is our over-the-air capability as well. That if something happens you are able to quickly go in and prevent and correct if that's necessary. So we named last year our champion, naming a Chief Product Security Officer, Jeff Massimilla, who is on our team, who lives and breathes this every day. We've partnered with external experts. We regularly do testing, but this is an area you have to stay diligent on and keep looking because it's across all of industry. We take it very seriously, we work hard at it every day and it's a key focus. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Emmanuel Rosner : I wanted to ask you first about the pricing environment in the U.S.. Obviously in your North American earnings work it seems like, focusing on the retail side, pricing was sort of slightly north of flat which is obviously a pretty good performance. At the same time, when I look at slide number 12 and you bring back the ATP incentive information from J.D. Power, it seems like your incentives are sort of like just been steadily, but fast increasing throughout the quarter from like 10% of ATP in the first month, 11% and then 12% finally in June. And then from what we heard so far in July, there's been also increased incentives, particularly on the truck. Would you be able to comment on are you seeing sort of a deterioration of U.S. pricing or a need to add incentive in specific segments? Chuck Stevens : I will give a broad perspective. Overall, in the U.S. industry this year our expectations are, on a retail basis, a relatively benign pricing environment. We talked about that when we talked about carryover pricing back at the beginning of the year and that's playing out. And I would expect to see pricing improve as we move through the rest of the year and start to launch some of the new products. In Q3, Q4 or early Q4, the carryover pricing dynamic will continue as it has been in the first part of the year. From an incentive spending perspective, that will -- as a percent of transaction price, that will toggle back and forth depending on specific go-to-market strategies at any point. My expectation, Emmanuel, for the rest of the year would be that we will be at the run rate we have been for the entire year, somewhere in the range of 10.5% to 11% for the balance of the year. Overall industry has been disciplined. We have been disciplined and we're going to continue to be disciplined, but there can be some volatility within an individual month for sure. Emmanuel Rosner : And then my second question is on China actually. When I think about China I totally agree with you there is some volatility now and obviously still a very exciting market for the long-term. The part that sort of worries me in the midterm is more the amount of capacity that's coming in into China. And so when I last met your China team, it sounded like you wanted to increase your capacity from 4 million units to 5 million units over the next few years. Is that still the goal? And to the extent that you would see a pronounced slowdown, do you still have room to sort of pull back on some of these capacity additions? Mary Barra : Absolutely. Actually adding capacity in China is something that we can do quite quickly. So we will continue to monitor the situation and look at, as we have our plans to add capacity, to do it prudently with a daily read on where the market is and then looking over that horizon from a trend of where it's going. So we will be monitoring that closely and we will only do when we think it's prudent to do. Emmanuel Rosner : Is there a rule of thumb that you could point to, like how many months or years in advance the plans that are in place will have to happen, let's say in the next six months, a year? And how far out can you actually sort of pull back some of these plans? Mary Barra : I think there is a lot of different ways to add capacity. You can add capacity by increasing line rate which is more equipment changes or smaller expansions, all the way to an all-new plan and each of those have different timelines. But I would also say China is one of the quickest across all of those aspects of being able to add capacity. Again, those are all the levers we have. Just a for-instance example, if you see you still need capacity but it might be slightly less than what you thought, you can pick an option of expanding an existing plan or increasing line rate, etc. So we will be looking at all of that, that is something we have a lot of experience from around the globe that we bring to the table as we work with our partner. Again, it will be very dynamic and based on not only the day, the month, but what we see and what we predict the trend will be as we go forward. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Mike Stover with Susquehanna Investment Group. Mike Stover : Most of my questions have been hit, but a housekeeping item on the cash flow. Could you give us a sense of any cash used for funding restructuring actions and then any cash that would've been impacted by recall-related outflows? Chuck Stevens : We indicated at the beginning of the year that we expected roughly $1.2 billion of restructuring-related cash and about $1.5 billion of recall-related cash to impact the results this year. Still generally in line with that first half, and second half will be about half. And so very much according to plan on both restructuring and recall-related cash. Mike Stover : Okay. So if I'm just trying to pencil in backing out what happened in the first quarter. If I assume that half of both of those items occurred in the first half that would be about right, Chuck? Chuck Stevens : Yes, that would be broad strokes, about right. Mike Stover : Okay. And then the second thing was on the ramp of the new product in North America. Do you expect for that to have a bigger impact on the incremental cost at the beginning of 2016 or should that begin at the end of 2016? Sorry, end of 2015 rather? Chuck Stevens : I think there are two aspects of that. There's preproduction start up and launch from the manufacturing perspective and I think that will primarily hit in 2016 and then there's launch-related costs which would be advertising. On any major program, when you look at both of those, they are roughly about the same. The launch manufacturing costs and the marketing launch costs are roughly the same. So again, thinking about the launch cadence -- the Cruze, Malibu and everything else I would think there is going to be some manufacturing primarily in the fourth quarter and marketing primarily in kind of the first quarter and second quarter next year, broad strokes. Operator : And our final question will come from the line of Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Dan Galves : I had a couple questions on North America for the back half. Is there any way you can help us with wholesale shipments? Typically it looks about kind of even first half versus second half, but maybe with the increased rental disposals in the first half it would be a little lower in the second half. Any color you can give us there? Chuck Stevens : Typically second half of the year generally in line. I would suggest that as we cycle through the third quarter there we're going to work our way through these auction losses. Then you have the fourth quarter with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday. So for planning perspective, I would think relatively flat to slightly down in the second half of the year versus the first half on wholesales. Again, just given the seasonality in the fourth quarter. Dan Galves : And then just going back to January, one thing on North America you said was that it looks to me that you were expecting fixed cost increases related to launches to offset to more than offset the reductions in material costs. It looks like through the first half you are way ahead on that metric with material costs down a lot, fixed costs basically flat. Should we be expecting that still, like some really significant fixed cost increases in the back half or has there been a change in the view? Chuck Stevens : I think the fixed costs in the second half of the year will be up versus the first half associated with the launch-related costs. The team in North America has just done a dynamic, great job in scheming the business and driving efficiency in the first half. But, again, I would expect to see launch-related costs, fixed costs be up in the second half and similar level of material performance in the second half of the year as well that we saw in the first half. Dan Galves : And just one more on Europe. Are there any kind of big pieces you can give us in terms of the sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2? I know volume was up a bit and were the Russia losses abating quite a bit in Q2 versus Q1? Chuck Stevens : Russia losses moderated for sure in Q2 versus Q1 and pricing likely got better in Q2 versus Q1. It did get better as the Corsa and Vivaro ramped up. Those would be the two biggest drivers Q2 versus Q1. Dan Galves : Okay, so that was more GM-specific than industry wide on the pricing improvement? Chuck Stevens :  Yes. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra for closing remarks. Mary Barra : Thank you very much. Appreciate everybody's participation on the call. Hopefully you saw we recognize that China's a big concern, obviously the market has changed, more volatile. It's moderating. We tried to really be specific and share with you how we think about China and have that be the foundation for what we think and we're going to keep the pressure on ourselves to deliver in the second half of the year. But, rest assured, we're actively monitoring it daily and also be working very hard to proactively position ourselves to continue to drive the performance that we have. I would also like to say, as you look across all the regions and I won't repeat all of them, but there are a lot of challenges and opportunities in each of the regions. Hopefully you see the GM leadership team is really seizing opportunities and mitigating challenges in a very proactive fashion. We think our overall results demonstrate the very strong earnings potential of this company. And we believe when you look at what we have been able to accomplish in the first half of this year, it lays the foundation for the commitments that we've made for 2016 that we're very focused on executing and providing the proof point that we're doing what we say we're going to do. As we move forward, we're going to continue to execute with discipline with all aspects of our plan, including our capital allocation framework and we're confident that we will continue to drive profitable growth, strong returns on invested capital which we demonstrated this quarter, all to drive shareholder value and that is our focus day in and day out. So thanks again, everybody. I really appreciate your time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, October 21, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy C. Arickx - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2015. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast on the Internet. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we will open the call for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The contents of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, to assist in answering any questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Randy, and welcome everyone. I'm glad you could join the call today, and I'm very pleased to share with you that we continue to drive strong performance and shareholder value in Q3. Let me give you some of the financial highlights. First, our revenue was $38.8 billion. Our EBIT adjusted of $3.1 billion was up $800 million year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin of 8% was up 2.2 percentage points from a year ago. Earnings per share adjusted of $1.50 was up 55% from last year. Adjusted automotive free cash flow of $0.8 billion reflects seasonality and the settlement of several uncertainties, and our 26% return on invested capital based on a trailing fourth-quarter average demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation is paying off. Our strong year-over-year performance in the quarter was led by North America. It had $3.3 billion in EBIT adjusted with an 11.8% EBIT-adjusted margin. These are both records for North America. Regarding China, you'll recall that last quarter, Chuck and I discussed with you the slowing growth in the China market, but we shared our plans for sustaining our margin in the second half based on our strong product mix and the ongoing work to drive cross-efficiencies. So, in the quarter, we maintained strong performance. Our equity income was $0.5 billion, and we achieved a 9.8% net income margin, which is up from a year ago. Overall, strong performance in cash generation enabled us to return $4.6 billion to our owners as of October 19 through both share buybacks and dividends. In addition to the strong performance in the quarter, I want to provide a couple updates on the progress we're making on our strategic priority. As we indicated in our Global Business Conference, we intend to lead and win in the future of personal mobility and create new revenue streams that will drive shareholder value. We are leveraging our connectivity leadership to enhance our relationship with the customer both inside and outside of the vehicle. One of the announcements we made was the Let's Drive New York City. This is a car-sharing program that uses our GM platform and app to connect Ritz Plaza tenants to GM vehicles and to Icon Parking. And we've gotten a good response. We've also announced that we plan to launch a city-wide car-sharing service in the U.S. in the first quarter of next year. Now, both of these are built on the work that we've done in the past and the success of the Opel CarUnity car-sharing app, as well as the learnings from our Google car-sharing pilot. In addition, let me talk about autonomous for a minute. We announced that we will implement a fleet of autonomous 2015 Chevrolet Volts at the Warren Tech Center next year. Not only will this accelerate our autonomous technical learnings, but it will also have us learn from an ecosystem perspective. And this builds on top of our previous autonomous announcements with the launching of Super Cruise and V2V that will both be on Cadillacs next year 2017 models. And we are strengthening our relationship with the customer inside the vehicle as well. OnStar is now on four continents; North America, Europe, South America and China. We have more customers connected to their vehicles than the rest of the industry combined. By yearend, brands on three continents will have 4G LTE technology \u2013 Cadillac in China; Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC in North America; and Opel and Vauxhall in Europe. Let's turn to a minute for the markets. First, in North America. Clearly, trucks, crossovers and SUVs drove strong sales gains. U.S. retail market share in Q3 was up nearly 1 percentage point from a year ago, 16.5% compared to 15.6% in 2014. GM's share of the entire retail full-size pickup segment is approximately 40%, up 2 percentage points from a year ago. And in the mid-size pickup segment, our new Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon pickups are already earning 40% of the retail share. And we have more coming from our three-truck strategy with the redesigned 2016 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. Not only will we have greater availability of the 8-speed transmission, we'll also have new safety features, including Lane Keep Assist and forward collision alert as well as enabling Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Moving to Europe. We're very excited about the all-new Opel Astra. And when we launched it, we had 30,000 pre-sell orders. The Astra has segment-leading active safety technologies and connectivity with OnStar and 4G LTE and also Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also enabled. In China, we had record sales of 2.5 million vehicles through Q3 driven by the strength of SUVs, MPVs and Cadillac. GM's year-over-year SUV sales were up 171% in September, led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. And Cadillac is up 12.4% year-to-date. At GM financial progress towards full captive capability is accelerating. Our North America retail penetration of 32% is up 21 percentage points versus a year ago. And looking ahead, we also announced in the quarter that we plan to invest $5 billion through 2019 to enhance the Chevrolet brand in key markets of China, Brazil, Mexico and India. And this really represents a new way of addressing these markets. It represents about a 2-million-vehicle opportunity annually. And what we're doing is replacing multiple legacy products with an all-new vehicle family that will have leading design and the right technology and the right value for those customers. We're leveraging our scale across the value chain to develop this new vehicle family that will require less capital, generate more volume, and drive more profitability. And as we look at cost efficiencies, we continue working across the entire value chain to make sure that we are as efficient as possible so we can enhance the customer experience and also drive shareholder value. As we talked about in the Global Business Conference, we have identified $5.5 billion of savings from the 2015 to 2018 timeframe. And that's from purchasing initiatives, manufacturing, driving for efficiencies and reducing administration expenses. These savings more than offset the additional brand and technology investments that we're making. And we also continue to work on the right partnerships. We announced the Navistar partnership that will allow us to provide a Chevrolet medium-duty truck in the U.S. in 2018. And not only is this a segment we're not in right now, but on the commercial side, it also will help us drive adjacent sales. We also continue to have a very productive partnership with Honda, focused on fuel cells. We're developing not only the next-generation hydrogen stack and storage system, but we're looking for other opportunities and the fuel cell work should be in the 2020 timeframe is what we are targeting. As I \u2013 as strong as the third quarter performance was though, we do understand and we are working to mitigate the headwinds that are in several areas around the globe. South America continues to be very challenging. The Brazil market is down 27% in the third quarter versus a year ago, and there's really no clear economic recovery in sight. As we talk about China, it is quickly maturing and we now expect average annual industry growth to be about 3% to 5% for the next few years. And the China slowdown is not only affecting our business in China but also in the other international operation markets outside of China because these economies are so dependent on China. This means growth will remain slow. But as I've said, as we look at the global auto industry, there will always be headwinds across the globe and we are committing to achieving our targets. As we said in January, for this calendar year, we fully expect EBIT adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins to be higher. And we continue to be confident on our trajectory towards the 2016 goals that we've outlined. Quickly, they are in North America, and, again, we're expecting to achieve the 10% margin this year ahead of schedule and plan to continue and sustain that performance into 2016. In Europe, we expect to be profitable in 2016, and we will earn that by capitalizing on the success of the Astra and Corsa launches that have higher variable profit. And despite the slower growth, there is still significant growth potential for China. Much of the growth will be in the tier 2 to 4 cities and that currently represents 85% of GM's volume. We will continue to focus on sustaining strong margins between 9% and 10% through the sales growth that is afforded by MPVs, SUVs, and Cadillac. And we also have other drivers that we've outlined of continuing to drive cost efficiencies, increasing our after sales, growing captive finance, and generating OnStar and connectivity revenue. We're also taking practice steps to manage the volatility in South Africa until there is a recovery. Our progress, or our work there started in 2011 to really drive efficiencies and we continue with several additional rounds, and we'll be doing that as we move forward. So, despite challenges in some markets, we are capitalizing on the strength for a \u2013 we capitalize on the strengths for a record-setting third quarter, and I'm very proud of the team. This performance increases our confidence and our plan to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and GM's results for the first nine months of the year. In addition to the record results that we posted in Q3, we've also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted results through September grew to $8 billion, up $1.3 billion year-over-year when you adjust 2014 for the impact of recalls. EBIT adjusted margins were at 7.1%, up 130 basis points again year-over-year after adjusting for the impact of recalls. Important to note that these results are very much on plan that we laid out earlier this year. Our adjusted earnings per share for the year-to-date period nearly doubled to $3.63 compared with last year. And as you step back and look at the results, they were broad-based on a year-over-year basis with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first nine months of the year. So clearly, we're on track for a very strong 2015 as we committed to deliver earlier this year. And now that we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date, we will continue to take additional actions to drive efficiencies into the business. As I covered at the Global Business Conference and Mary just mentioned, we expect to drive $5.5 billion of run rate efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. And these efficiencies will more than offset economics, increased investments in brand building, increased depreciation and amortization and technology costs during that timeframe. And all of these costs and cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence, which is our corporate initiative to drive common tools, common processes but really most importantly, a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization and we are getting significant traction on that even in 2015. So the GM team is very focused on finishing the year strong and really carrying that positive momentum forward into 2016 and beyond. Just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. As Mary mentioned, the company sustained strong operating results in Q3, which is consistent with the guidance that we provided you back in July. Although it's clear the industry has moderated, I think it's also clear that the region has not fallen off a cliff, as some observers predicted. In fact, as we talked about after our Q2 earnings, industry sales began to improve sequentially as the third quarter progressed. And we continue to see improved performance thus far in October. And despite the moderating industry, we generated strong performance for the first nine months of the year, $1.5 billion in equity income and 10% net margins. And as we've talked about on a number of occasions, we've been able to generate these results specifically because the team in China has been proactively managing the market risks with several actions such as optimizing mix, and you saw the results with the September sales being up significantly from an SUV perspective, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost-down-efficiency-up initiatives and really working to manage our inventory levels and ensure that we're aligning supply and demand. And we are encouraged by China's cut in the purchase tax. And we are encouraged that it will provide a tailwind to the industry for the rest of the year and into 2016, but our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of the business. So our previous guidance growth in the low-single digit range, and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed. Our guidance for Q3 is consistent with the guidance that we provided after our Q2 earnings. Moving closer to home. Clearly, North America has put up some impressive numbers for the quarter. Again, record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins of $3.3 billion and 11.8%. Importantly, year-to-date, we've achieved EBIT-adjusted of $8.3 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.5%. And despite typical seasonality in Q4, increased launch costs and other seasonal impacts like lower production due to the holidays, we are very much on track to achieve a 10% margin in the region in 2015. And importantly, that's an accomplishment that we're going to deliver ahead of our longstanding 2016 commitment. We're in the process of finalizing our 2016 planning assumptions and will provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for 2016. But as Mary said, we certainly plan to deliver 10% margins again in 2016. With regard to our outlook for the remainder of this year, as I said, we're very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2014. This will translate into EBIT-adjusted from a total company basis north of $10 billion for the year. South America remains challenging, and there really is no near-term macroeconomic recovery in sight. But we will continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and our results in that region. And I would just emphasize that our view is that we are highly leveraged to the recovery when it comes in South America because of the actions we've taken over the last number of years. With specific regard to capital spending and free cash flow, I'd like to provide an update. First, on the capital spending front. Due to the timing of cash payments versus the accrual of our obligations, our revised cash CapEx forecast for the year is now $8 billion compared to our previous guidance of $9 billion. We continue to expect that our capital spending accruals will be in the range of $9 billion this year, so this is just a timing issue. Although we're still finalizing next year's planning assumptions, I would not expect this change and timing to materially impact our prior guidance that cash capital expenditures would be approximately 5% to 5.5% of revenue on an ongoing basis. As I said earlier, we will provide more specific guidance in January, but from a general planning perspective, the 5% to 5.5% still applies. And although we're expecting a lower amount of capital spending this year from a cash perspective, our free cash flow forecast is still expected to be about flat compared with 2014. The cash outlays associated with our recent legal settlements will offset the lower capital spending amount, enabling us to maintain that outlook that we provided after the second quarter earnings. We also remain very committed to enhancing shareholder value over time as evidenced by the $4.6 billion of capital return to our owners thus far this year. And we will continue to execute to our transparent capital allocation framework. So, that concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : We will pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning, and congrats, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Itay. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Chuck, I was hoping you can just maybe kind of quantify the rental impact this quarter in North America on variable profits? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I would say that the impact of rental in wholesales, if you look at the wholesales on a quarter-over-quarter basis, up about $100,000. About two-thirds of that was related to rental auctions. And then I'm not going to give you specific input on the variable profit itself, but from a pricing perspective, the Q3 pricing, roughly $100 million of that was associated with the rental auction issue as we cycle through that. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. And then I know it's a little early to talk about 2016, but I'll give it a shot, and congrats, of course, on reaching or expecting to reach a 10% target this year. As we think about some of the product cycle tailwinds next year on new product mix, is it fair to say that margin expansion next year is a fair early assessment for the year versus 2015? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Itay, I am absolutely surprised that somebody would ask that question about 2016. We will provide specific guidance on that in January. Our objective, our commitment and what Alan talked about on October 1 at the Global Business Conference is to drive this business to sustain 10% margins through the cycle. So, as we evaluate how the industry is shaping up and everything else for next year, we'll come back and talk about that in January. We've reached the first milestone. We expect to generate 10% for this year. And then clearly our objective is to make sure we build this business to sustain that again throughout the cycle. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Just one last quick housekeeping, of the $5.5 billion of efficiencies through 2018, Chuck, just remind us how much is left of the 2016-to-2018 period? I know you're realizing some of that this year. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I'll provide a further input on that in January as well. But if you look just one of the components of that, this year we've talked about non-raw-material performance of $2 billion. We're very, very much on track to deliver that. So, broadly speaking it would be $5.5 billion less that \u2013 I mean, generally, so about $3.5 billion left to go. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Terrific. Thank you very much and congrats again everyone. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Congratulations. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Hey, Rod. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a couple questions. I was hoping first you might be able to give us a little bit more color on the China earnings bridge. Obviously, you had a 4% decline in wholesales. And I'm assuming that you experienced this that you were talking about a 5% decline in price on your Q2 call. So, if we were to construct a bridge year-over-year from 3Q to 3Q, what would the dollar impact be if we thought about some of the buckets that you usually provide like volume, price mix and cost? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I'll give you the breakdown from a driver-perspective base, Rod, but not the specifics on the EBIT bridge. Clearly, the volume would be down and price would be down largely offset by mix and improved cost performance, I mean, fundamentally the cost performance is largely in material cost performance. And we've talked before around kind of the pricing headwind year-over-year on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and it's been running generally about $100 million. I mean, that's what that equates to \u2013 from that bridge perspective. So, volume down, price down, largely offset by improved mix \u2013 and, again, you've seen that in the sales results with SUVs and Cadillac sales being up \u2013 and material cost efficiency. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You're targeting flat IO for the year, which implies a little bit of a drop in the fourth quarter. Should we be thinking that China starts to look a little a bit better from a volume perspective given the stimulus? And that it's the consolidated IO that's coming off? Could you just give us a little bit more of a feel for what you're expecting there? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. As we talked about in the second quarter and we're maintaining here, we expected to sustain China performance in the second half of the year, similar to the first half of the year. So, we earned about $1 billion of equity income in China in the first half; we would expect to earn in that range in the second. So, we're $1.5 billion in so far, so you can do the subtraction. What we said about GMIO in total including China is relatively comparable results year-over-year. And again, I would suggest that we're very, very much on plan from a China perspective. GMIO, if you look at last year, the results there \u2013 or even year-to-date, the results that we've generated there, a loss in the range of $500 million to $600 million is what would \u2013 for the year, what would generally be consistent on a comparable basis. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just lastly, two quick ones. When we \u2013 if we were to add up all of these actions that you're taking in South America, could you give us a total of what you're anticipating as the cost savings? And on North America, you mentioned you're expecting pricing flat to down. Is that a change versus what you had been anticipating previously? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: For the latter question, if you go back to the discussion we had back in January, I remember a chart that I showed. It showed carryover pricing in 2015 versus 2014 from a North America perspective was going to be down. I would say what we're seeing in North America is the general pricing dynamic on a year-over-year basis is consistent with our prior guidance. Retail pricing is going to be relatively flat, and most of the year-over-year deterioration is due to this, the rental car issue that we were dealing with. So, as I think about a go-forward basis or just the fundamental market dynamics, I think stronger retail performance, but generally, overall pricing in line with what we talked about before. Relative to the South America question, where do you want me to go back to, 2011 or 2012 or just this year on a run rate basis? Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, we see what the profitability is there, right? So what \u2013 how do things improve from the run rate that you're at right now, if we were to add all these actions together? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So, yeah. Assuming consistent macro conditions in 2016 versus 2015 and we're not really assuming anything different. I'm not trying to give guidance for 2016 yet, but we took out 20% of the workforce down there, both hourly and salary, that's 4,000 to 5,000 people. That action in and of itself, on a run-rate basis, is worth a couple of $100 million a year. But there's other puts and takes, Rod, that I don't think you can just directly translate that into a guidance for 2016. Economics is pretty significant. We have productivity. We have other actions that we'll take to improve mix. Relative to specifics for 2016, we'll have more to say in January. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks. Yeah, first question and back to the kind of the pricing in China, have you seen any sort of improvement in pricing as inventories appear to come down for the industry throughout Q3? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I would say that the pricing dynamic is developing as we anticipated at least through Q3. Obviously, we'll continue to monitor that as we go through Q4. As we talked about before, we expected Q4 to be better from an industry performance driven by seasonality and product launches. The product launches could change the dynamic from a pricing perspective. But I'd say, generally consistent and too early to tell if that's changing as dealer inventories are getting kind of more in line at the industry level. Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Got it. And then I had a couple of questions related to the issues that Volkswagen is having in Europe. Number one is have you seen any industry-wide impact to demand overall or to demand for diesel vehicles yet, or is this still too early to tell? And also, I mean, not asking to comment, but the \u2013 some of the numbers being thrown around for impact of Volkswagen are very high. Does that change your \u2013 GM's thinking at all in terms of the minimum cash required to protect against any kind of catastrophes? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Let me start by saying right now, our outlook for diesel remains unchanged. I think it's too early to look and make any judgments on that. Related to \u2013 again, we're not going to comment on the VW. But I think as we've gone through and looked at the very robust planning that we did last year as we put together the capital allocation framework, we remain committed to the $20 billion. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: And let's not forget, Dan, that we also have a revolver. And the revolver is an emergency backstop. And total liquidity is at $32 billion and I don't think that you can really plan your cash balance around a potential \u2013 I'm just using this in a general term, I'm not speaking specifically to Volkswagen. But a company type event. So, just not a good use of shareholder capital. Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, makes sense. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a first question on North America. I mean, obviously there's a lot of strength here. And it seems like mix in price were actually a little bit of a negative. So just curious, how we should think about the contribution of new products are playing the profitability in North America. I know you kind of talked about the $1,500 per copy on the new products, but obviously, a lot of people are very skeptical about that, but it seems to be coming through. Just kind of understanding what role those new products are playing and what we should expect really in the fourth quarter and maybe even going into 2016. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, first, mix is unfavorable largely because of the rental auction vehicles, right? I mean, buying was favorable, $400 million roughly; mix, unfavorable, largely offsetting that due primarily to the impact of those vehicles. We are committed on the next-generation vehicles as we roll through the launch cadence being more profitable than the vehicles that they replace. I just think about it, broadly speaking, if you look at the Cruise, the Malibu, the next-generation compact SUVs, the Equinox, Train and then the next-generation mid-crossovers, in total, that volume is more than the entire K2XX platform. And we delivered with the K2XX platform an improvement in profitability, as we talked about way back in 2012, of over $1,000 a vehicle. And that's generally the perspective that we're going to see and what we've talked about relative to the next product launches. So that's going to help us. Specific to your Q4 question on pricing, I think \u2013 and this is typically what happens in Q4 sequentially as you launch the new model, years and everything else. I think it will be a slight favorable overall pricing environment. Retail will be up and partially offset by fleet. And that would just be the typical fleet cadence as we roll through the rental auctions. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: And a large part of that retail price favorability in Q4 will be associated with the launch of the new Malibu. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And just as we think forward, I'm not asking for 2016 guidance, but I mean, you're talking about 10% margins for North America, you did 10.5% year-to-date as we look at the LTM, you're kind of in that range or maybe even a little bit better on adjusted basis. I mean, is there some sort of negative factor that you're looking at into 2016 that's going to suppress numbers or something that's not going to repeat in 2016, or is this really just an initial guide and we should revisit this in January? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Well, first, we're 10.5% calendar year-to-date, and if you go back and look at Q4 from a seasonal perspective, that's typically one of the weak quarters from a margin perspective due to everything that we understand, Thanksgiving holiday, Christmas holiday, a lot of marketing spend around football. And in our case this year, some launch products. So, I would say for 2015, we are very confident that we're going to generate 10% margins. As we talked about before, we are going to continue to invest in marketing to build our brands. We're going to continue to spend engineering associated with our product launch cadence and next-generation products so that we can sustain 10% margins throughout the cycle, and we'll have a more specific guidance around that. But the real way to think about this, John, is we're at 10% in 2015, a year early. We're going to run the business to sustain that 10% kind of margin on an ongoing basis. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Makes a lot of sense. Then on, just on GM Financial, revenue was up 36%, EBIT up 13%. I know that's a potential area for structural improvement in EBIT over the next couple of years. When do we see sort of a linear or sort of parallel step-up in EBIT along with just a growth in revenue and loan book there? Just curious like, I mean, it just seems like at some point we're going to see a real step-up. Is that 2016, 2017, or 2018? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I think it will be beyond 2016 as we continue to ramp up both the operations, but also you're taking on debt in advance of the assets. I think the real lever point will be beyond 2016, John. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Just lastly on buybacks, you've clearly gotten a lot of stuff out of the way here on the DoJ fine, a lot of the ignition switch settlements pretty much wrapped up. You're looking at a pretty strong 2016. I mean, when do you think you could reconsider more buybacks? I mean, is that late this year or is that sometimes in 2016 when you get better visibility on year-end balance sheet and liquidity and 2016 results? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, we did extinguish some risks. We still have a handful of open items that we'll work to resolve as timely as we can but done in the right way. And we'll be ready to talk about that in January of next year, of where we're at from a capital allocation perspective. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Mary, what are those specific hurdles or items that still need to get resolved? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: There's still a couple of investigations with the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC. Then there's also parts of the multidistrict litigation. There's still some state attorney claims and there's also the economic loss. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hi. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : First question on the pricing in North America. So, the retail pricing was somewhat negative. Can you maybe give a little bit of color on where specifically on retail you saw sort of like this pricing pressure, in either segments or vehicles? And how does that reflect or not some of the U.S. market dynamics right now? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, let me just start at 10,000 feet Emmanuel, 11.8% margins, so that's what we generated in the third quarter. So just very, very strong outstanding performance. Within that, there was carryover price headwinds which is typical in the third quarter as you work through and sell down your prior model year products. And when you think about as where we are in the launch cadence, it's no surprise that some of our vehicles are getting longer in the tooth. And we continue to support those products. But I think you need to look at it in the context of 11.8% margins. We already talked about Q4. And we talked about the calendar year from a pricing perspective. Overall, the dynamics in the industry remain reasonably rational. Overall incentive spending and incentive spending as a percent of transaction price is up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Our incentive spend as a percentage of, compared to the industry average ran at 110%, which is consistent with last year. So, we feel reasonably good about the competitive dynamics. But we're really feeling pretty constructive on our launch cadence and the products that we'll be bringing into the market next year, which will come with favorable pricing. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. That's good to hear. And then just on GMIO ex-China, maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but seemed like a slight deterioration in the last maybe versus the past few quarters. When can we expect, I guess, this region to turn to breakeven ex-China, ex other unusual items? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. We will talk more about that in January as we go through the planning. I would say that the viewpoint should be that we continue to aggressively look at all of our operations, all of our countries where we're currently not generating a return to drive efficiency, to drive structural change, to position the business for future success. We were making good progress in GMIO. The current macro situation there with the slowdown in China that Mary talked about is having an impact, but we will continue to take those actions and we'll provide an update on that on a go-forward basis. Again thinking about the broad context from a company perspective, $3.1 billion in EBIT and 8% margins, and I think the real opportunity is once we get the rest of the regions operating very well, that will even be more accretive to what was a very strong, actually a record quarter. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : I agree. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Stover with SIG. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Thank you very much. I was just wondering if we could go back into the North America accounting issue with the rental car fleet. If I heard you correctly, Chuck, you'd indicated that most of the excess of wholesale versus production was related to the rental car volumes, is that correct? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That's correct. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: And then, you'd mentioned the pricing was $100 million. Is there a bigger impact on the profit side, because if I look at the incremental operating leverage in North America, at 50% it seemed awfully strong. I know there's a lot of good things going on, but that just seemed like a really strong incremental operating leverage. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, one of the things that we talked about and if you look at the share performance year-to-date is our real focus on shifting our volumes out of fleet and into retail because retail is more profitable than fleet. And part of that as you're seeing with this higher rental vehicles going through auction as we sell less than obviously we're going to be sending more into the auction. Generally, at 10,000 feet \u2013 fleet \u2013 the fleet business is profitable especially commercial and government. Daily rental, pretty close to breakeven, when you look throughout the whole value chain impact on that. But clearly our objective is to drive more in the retail which is more profitable. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Okay. The second question is, is if we look at the IO results ex-China, you've announced restructuring actions in Australia, Indonesia and Thailand. When should we expect to see the impact of those actions in the financial results based on the execution of the restructurings? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. More to come on that, again, in January. We're still working through the Australia actions, and those won't be completed until 2017. We're still working through the Thailand actions and hoping they leave the shift of moving to fundamentally a truck SUV platform there will happen through 2017. So, these are ongoing. I would suggest that in a more historical macro environment versus some of the headwinds we're facing there this year, slowing growth in Southeast Asia, a very weak Aussie dollar, some of the other challenges related to China, we would be seeing year-over-year improvement already. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna International Group, LLP: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Three questions around commodities around Europe and then kind of a broader one around self-driving cars. First, commodities. You mentioned the material benefit in GMNA as well as globally. To what extent was that driven by the whole commodity complex being lower versus supplier, value engineering efforts and if it's mostly from the latter, working the suppliers, as some of your commodity contracts renew, can we expect a tailwind from commodities going forward? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. The overall impacts in the quarter from commodity pricing was minimal. It was largely driven by commercial performance and logistics performance. And on a go-forward basis, just to provide a sensitivity on commodity, when we look at the year, I would say year-to-date, the year-over-year impact is a couple of hundred million bucks. And we would expect that to be kind of the calendar year impact. Overall, our APV or our annual purchase value of commodities is about $28 billion. About 30% of that or so is indexed, which means we take the risk. 5% movement in commodities is worth $400 million to $500 million on an annual basis, all other things being equal. And as we look at 2016 versus 2015, if current commodity prices continue, I would think it would be a tailwind. But, again, that will continue to work through our planning for 2016 and provide more guidance on that in January. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Second question, around Europe, two questions. Are you seeing any \u2013 you saw pricing firming in 3Q. What impact do you see on pricing from Volkswagen's issues? Is it on the one hand, they could potentially become desperate and pull the price down or on the other hand, can you get paid for some of the value you can add to drivers? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: The pricing strength in Q3 specific to General Motors and Opel Vauxhall was the launch of new products and new product pricing. So, our new products are getting traction and that's good. And we would expect to see that continue as we work through the launch cadence. It is really too early to tell and too early to speculate on what could happen with the competitive dynamics in Europe. Our focus is to launch our products, deliver great products that have compelling value, continue to drive improvements in the Opel brand which, in general, under any circumstance, will provide pricing power vis-\u00e0-vis where we're at today. The overall environment could change, but at least on a relative basis, by executing our plan, we should have better pricing power than we have today. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And if the consumer comes into the showroom, and on the margin goes more for gas engines than diesel engines, do you have the gas engine plant capacity to satisfy their demand? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. From an industry perspective, in Europe we're underweight diesels versus the competition. Our diesels run at about 40%, and the rest of the industry is somewhere between 50% and 70%. They certainly have the flexibility. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Great. And final question kind of around self-driving cars. We had a new entrant automaker rollout, what they're calling autopilot, last week. Can you remind us of the timing of the Cadillac Super Cruise? And then just more broadly, how do you think about how fast to get these things to market versus making sure that they run effectively and you're not in a sort of \u2013 folks in Silicon Valley would say, throw stuff out there, and let the users beta test it. Just kind of your philosophy on that technologically. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think, for some, with the tremendous experience that General Motors has as we look at safety and we look at integrating and \u2013 one of the reasons we announced that we, by the end of next year, will have 2017 Chevrolet Volt on autonomous fleet at our tech center is to not only advance the technology, but also to understand it in the ecosystem, also have tremendous exposure to our engineering team at that site. And all of those things I think will point to advance the work we're doing, accelerate it from a technical and from all of the other aspects that you need to have come together from an autonomous perspective. And the way I look at autonomous in general is that there's two paths, and we're working on both. I mean there's the path that we're on where if you look at especially a Cadillac today, there's tremendous technology around it that is on the road to full autonomous with all the safety features and all the warning and the ability to have forward collision braking, et cetera. When you look at Super Cruise and the V2V communication, those will both be on 2017 Cadillacs, but they'll be in the marketplace next year. And then we have also announced a strong partnership and the work we continue to do with Mobileye. We were their first customer. We're their largest customer. We continue to work closely with them. And we're also exploring some other opportunities. So, I look at it is there's the evolutionary path where you're putting a technology on and customers get the opportunity to experience it. And then there's the revolutionary path where you go full autonomous. We're executing both. But I assure you that we're doing it with a huge focus on safety as we go forward. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Can you remind us about the impact that rental pricing has had year-to-date because despite your 10%, 10.5% year-to-date margin, that was actually a pretty big headwind. And is that going to go away next year? Or is that still going to be a residual risk next year? Is that actually going to be a pretty large tailwind? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I would again, think about pricing in an overall broad context, I think our guidance for the year is that pricing is going to be consistent with what we talked about back in January, which was more of a headwind in 2015 versus prior years. Year-to-date kind of the fleet-alone impact is roughly $700 million to $800 million of negative net price. As you recall, it was $400 million in Q1, a couple of hundred million dollars in Q2, and then $100 million in Q3. We aren't ready to provide guidance on pricing going into 2016 yet, although, I would say that, overall, we would expect a net favorable positive pricing environment really being driven by the launch of our new products. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Can you give any color on what you're seeing in initial demand following the stimulus in China? I mean, because you've kind of said that you think now 3% to 5% is the long-term outlook? Is this having a big help in the near-term though? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I didn't catch the beginning of your question, I'm sorry, Colin, I couldn't hear. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, sorry. Any color on the near-term impact from stimulus? Have you seen a spike in demand following the announcement? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Not yet. And there is, obviously, something that we continue to closely monitor. What we've seen so far in October is our retail sales are up over 10% on a year-over-year basis, all right, it's early days in October, the industry is up, but we expected that as well. We're dealing with, in China right now, holiday season, so there's some specific nuances from a market perspective, but that's something we're going to continue to monitor. And remember, this programs runs through the end of 2016. So typically, with any of these kinds of things maybe you'll get some rollover from the tail end of September into October, but the real big bump will be near the end of next year depending on what the government does if they announce they're not going to extend it or if they decide to extend it so let's see how it plays out. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. And any color on Europe, can give us the status of the Russia wind-down, the Chevy wind-down and any color on what kind of headwind those were within this year's result? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I'm not going to talk about specific country-level profitability with Chevy Europe, but we talked about before that Russia was a fairly significant headwind and that as we move through the year, that impact would diminish. And it has. From an overall GM Europe perspective, we are very much through the Chevy Europe wind-down, and that has went very much \u2013 as a matter of fact both the Chevy Europe wind-down and kind of the Russia restructuring plans have went very, very much according to plan. And specific to Chevy Europe, the bright spot is the vast majority of the dealers that were impacted by that have opted to move to Opel based on the opportunities presented there. And part of the strategy with the new Karl, which is doing very, very well was to help fill some of the void that was created when we provided some of that clean air with the Chevrolet Europe exit. So, both of those are going very well, and on a go-forward basis, clearly, we'll provide an opportunity in Europe. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on another great quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Ryan. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : First question, on mix in China, I think your performance in China this quarter was like better than investors expected. So, our internal checks suggest enhanced pricing pressures in the country although your margin notably rose year-over-year. Can you talk about the drivers of that margin strength? How much is being driven by mix, right, by the new models, SUVs, CUV mix, traction of Cadillac brand? And then, how was that mix improvement accomplished and how should we think about it tracking going forward given there seems to be a consensus that sales in China will move towards the less wealthy tier 3, tier 4 cities in the interior relative to the richer coastal cities? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. First, we kind of covered the mix question earlier, that mix and the material cost performance offset kind of the volume and price headwinds. And again, if you'll look at the sales results, September as an example, SUV sales up 171% year-over-year. SUVs as a percent of total China sales were at 17% versus 6% in the year-earlier period. Cadillac, up 12%. So that's all very beneficial. On a go-forward basis Matt talked about, at the Global Business Conference, Matt Tsien, that where the market was going to develop and the real growth was going to come in SUVs, MPVs and luxury on a go-forward basis, they were going to over-index. And that's why we believe that there's a significant opportunity from a mix perspective going forward. I would also suggest that in the tier 2 to tier 4 cities, the launch of the Baojun brand and the expansion into SUVs provide us with a unique opportunity to take advantage of not only SUVs in the Chevrolet, Buick, and Cadillac channel, but also SUVs in the Baojun brand as growth increases in tier 2 to 4 cities. So, our perspective is mix is going to continue to be a favorable tailwind for us going forward. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just for my last question, let me try to approach, I guess, what some are calling dieselgate from a different perspective by folks and what it means for your previously communicated strategies. So, one of your DRIVE!2022 goals for Europe is to improve the perception of and therefore the pricing of your vehicles. We met with Michael Lohscheller in R\u00fcsselsheim earlier in the year. It seemed the team there was already focused on the opportunity to improve Opel pricing relative to VW even before the emergence of this issue just by building better product. And as you know though from your work on Cadillac in the U.S., sometimes you can build much better product, then there's sometimes a time lag between when you field the better product and when you get fully rewarded for it because you also have to change the consumer mind. So, does the VW situation chip away at all at this consumer perception in Europe at least of engineering superiority associated with that brand, and so therefore play into the look-again theme relative to Opel? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think if you look at the plan that we've been on to not only have a winning product into the marketplace for Opel and Vauxhall but also build the brand. And there's been tremendous work done by Tina M\u00fcller, our Head of Marketing for Opel and Vauxhall, of doing just that, and the metrics prove out that we have changed minds, and there is more favorability around the Opel brand. And then when you look at the strong products that we have, the Corsa, the Karl and then when you look at the Astra. And the Astra not only is a great vehicle from a styling and I'll say a fundamentals perspective, but it has safety features that are industry-leading. It has connectivity that's not available across and also some features that are generally only available in luxury. So, as we look at the strengths of Corsa, Karl and the whole portfolio, there is the youngest \u2013 it's everything I think approximately four years or less. So, we feel that we're very well positioned going into the market with these launches. And we're going to work hard to earn every sale. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Congrats again. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Yeah. Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. I guess my first one is just on the implied margin for the fourth quarter in North America. And I guess I would just frame this question as not being nitpicky. It's more of a function of just third quarter being so good that when you back into the fourth quarter based on the 10% margin for the year, it implies somewhere close to 9%, which would be slightly better than what you did last year, maybe 30 basis points or so, but certainly short of the 200 basis points of margin improvement year-on-year that you saw this quarter. So, is a lot of that just the incremental launch costs? I mean, I think you mentioned 16 vehicles basically ramping up. So, I wanted a little bit more color on that first. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, sure. Clearly, as you continue to drive the business towards a 10% sustainable margin the year-over-year comparisons are going to get more and more challenging. We've had nine straight quarters of margin expansion. You can do the math. We're at 10.5% year-to-date. So, it's not hard to figure out the floor for Q4 in order to hit 10% or something better than that for the year. I would say this year, we do have some incremental launch costs in the fourth quarter associated with the Malibu and a number of other products, and it's both manufacturing and marketing that are going to be somewhat of a headwind. But again, I would say as we continue to rotate through the next number of quarters, the year-over-year comparisons for margin expansion aren't going to be as strong as they have been when we've been driving from a 7% margin to a 10% margin. But I think broadly speaking, Patrick, your math is kind of correct. I mean, it's not a hard math exercise to solve. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Well, thank you. No, that's helpful color on the reasons for it. I guess my other \u2013 a lot of my questions were answered but one that I was curious about just on the V2V product, which I think is the Cadillac, that's going to be fitted on the Cadillac in, I think 2017. It seems like you guys are going ahead of the NHTSA mandate on this, right? I mean, they are working on rules to make this required and you'll be ahead of that. And just wanted to understand what benefits you get from that technology? Because it seems like there needs to be a certain critical mass for it to work, especially if it's based off of communicating with other vehicles. So, just wanted your opinion on that. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think the biggest benefit is getting it into the marketplace, getting the learnings. Clearly to your point, you do need the communication, you need everyone to play but someone's got to start and take the leadership role. We do work in a very strong fashion with NHTSA, our regulator, and looking at what we're doing, how we're driving it and how the regulations and the rules around this will be. But we think it's very important to get it into the marketplace to drive the learnings, to drive the scale, because with any new technology, there is always something you learn when you get it into the marketplace. So, that's our look at that and again, same thing with Super Cruise. I mean, Super Cruise, first of all, is built on the embedded connectivity capability that we have but getting that in the marketplace, having customers get to experience it is very important steps along the journey because we're working hard to be in a leadership position with autonomous as we move forward, but in a very responsible way, aligned with our goals to be industry leaders in safety. Patrick K. Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Understood. Thanks for the color and congrats on the quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just one quick one, a little bit bigger picture, appreciate the color on your relative less dependence on diesel in Europe, but clearly, diesel was still part of the plan towards hitting 95 grams per kilometer of CO2. So I guess what I \u2013 my question is are you drawing up contingency plans? Do you need to sort of double down on electrification or other alternative powertrains, just in case either something from a consumer demand or regulatory perspective happens? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, so I mean, if you go back \u2013 and Chuck mentioned the fact, we have a lower diesel impact than some other OEMs if you look at it from a global perspective. But we do have both capability in diesels as well as \u2013 we're driving a lot of improvements in the internal combustion engine, again, from an electrification perspective, not only with the second generation Volt that has been not only improving the power density, but also driving cost efficiencies, and then you look at the Bolt. And we talked about where we will be with our kilowatt-per-hour target as we launch the Bolt, and then how we'll further take that cost down. And in addition to that, I mentioned briefly in my opening remarks what we have working with Honda from a fuel cell perspective. So we've always believed in kind of our propulsion diversity strategy. I think we've got very good work going on in each of those areas. And so again, we think it's too soon to tell, but we have tremendous flexibility across the portfolio, across the globe as we look at all of our propulsion strategy. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. I now would like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Well again, I appreciate everybody being on the call. Our overall results, again, demonstrate the very strong earnings potential of General Motors. Our results through the third quarter lay the foundation for achieving our commitments for the remainder of 2015 and 2016. We are working extremely hard to make sure we deliver on what we say we're going to do. As we move forward, we intend to execute our plan with discipline, and that includes the capital allocation framework. And we are confident that we will drive profitable growth, strong returns on invested capital, and shareholder value. So again, thank you all for participating today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, Wednesday, February 3, 2016. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx. Please go ahead, sir. Randy C. Arickx - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year of 2015. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast on the Internet. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we'll open the lines for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The contents of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President-Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Randy, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call. I'm extremely pleased to report that in 2015, GM delivered record net income, record EBIT-adjusted and record EBIT adjusted margins. To give you a few highlights, the fourth quarter revenue was $39.6 billion. EBIT-adjusted of $2.8 billion was up $400 million year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin of 7% was up 90 basis points year-over-year. Earnings per share adjusted of $1.39, was up 17% over last year. And for the year, we generated record net income of $9.7 billion and record EBIT-adjusted of $10.8 billion. In fact, our EBIT-adjusted increased 65% to $5.02. In our 27.2% ROIC, for 2015, demonstrates that our disciplined capital allocation framework is paying off. Our record operating performance enabled us to return approximately $5.7 billion to our owners during 2015. This significant capital return demonstrates our ongoing commitment to enhance shareholder value over time. I'd like to share a little progress of what we're doing as we lead the transformation of personal mobility and also what we're doing to strengthen our core business. We gained considerable momentum in the fourth quarter and early this year on game changing personal mobility initiatives. First, let's talk about ridesharing. Our announcement with the strategic alliance with Lyft is very significant because we believe, together, we can work and put an autonomous fleet of sharing vehicles available for use quicker than anyone else. We also believe in the short-term the arrangement that we have of Lyft will allow us to capitalize on providing and being a preferred provider for short-term-use vehicles for Lyft drivers that will support not only General Motors' performance, but also Lyft's performance. When we look in China, we've also introduced a carpooling pilot for 700 employees in Shanghai, and this is driven by a mobile app. And if you recall what we talked about in October, having that interface and the connection through a smart device is very important and we continue to build on that capability. As we look at car-sharing programs, we are doing a number of things that are really leveraging our connectivity leadership based on two decades of OnStar technology. First, we created Maven, and that really brings together many of the pilots that are actually transforming from pilots into projects that we are replicating across different cities that allows us to have a single brand that would pull all that together. We've also made sure that we have the experts not only from ridesharing and car-sharing experiences outside the company, we've brought them in, but also connecting to the individuals in the company that understand the connected car. And acquiring Sidecar's technology and assets is another proof point there as several of its employees have joined the Maven team along with having access to that technology. And on an electrification front, we expanded our EV leadership as we unveiled the Chevrolet Bolt EV at CES. This is a vehicle that we plan on producing by year-end. And for the second generation, the 2016 Volt won the Green Car Journal of the Year Award and that vehicle will be shipping shortly. And as we look at fuel cells, a longer range technology, we now have a program with the U.S. Army where we're developing an extreme off-road hydrogen fuel cell Chevrolet Colorado that will allow us to test our latest technology in military duty-type cycles. So, again very important. In addition to the work that we're doing in the transformation of personal mobility, we also continue to work on strengthening our core business. Last year, GM posted its third consecutive year of record sales and we were number one in North America, South America, and China, demonstrating our commitment to our brands and our commitment to earning customers for life. In particular, we strengthened our global Chevrolet and Cadillac brands last year. In the U.S. Chevrolet grew retail market share faster than any other full line brand in the industry, up by 0.4 percentage points. And our full year global Cadillac sales are up 8%. And in China, it was a record 17%. In North America, we continue to be very disciplined in our sales approach, and it's paying off. We had record ATPs and the best retail and total sales since 2007. GM's 2015 retail sales are up 8% over 2014. Our average GM ATPs of more than $34,600 exceed the industry average by $4,000. Our year-end total inventory was down more than 100,000 units or 14%, which is the lowest in four years. And then at 61 days, our 2015 year-end supply was the lowest in six years. And we're also very pleased with the early signs and feedback that we're getting on the Chevrolet Malibu, again a very important vehicle that we're launching and January was a positive \u2013 was very positive signal of how that car is going to be received into the marketplace. In Europe, Opel and Vauxhall saw improved full year sales and market share for the third straight year. In China, GM posted record sales of 3.6 million vehicles, up 5% year-over-year, and we outpaced the industry on the strong mix of SUVs, MPVs and luxury vehicles. And just a couple data points there. We achieved record overall market share of 14.9%, including more than 50% of the MPV segment. And for SUVs, our sales rose 144%, which was led by the Buick Envision and the Baojun 560. And at GM Financial, we continue to make strides toward full captive capability. In 2015, one in every three of GM's retail sales was financed by GMF, and this was up from 1 in 10 just a year ago. We are well on our way of achieving the $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies also that we talked about and we plan to do this by 2018, and we expect that these savings will more than offset the additional investments we're making in our brands and in the technology that we need to not only be compliant but to lead in the industry. In 2015, we had more than $2 billion in savings in non-raw material and logistics, ahead of the commitment and twice what we achieved in 2014. As we move into 2016, we expect another year of positive performance from material and logistics' standpoint, and I also want to add, we're doing it the right way with working and strengthening the relationship with many of our key suppliers. We'll also continue to leverage and drive efficiencies for using our operational excellence, which is built on Six Sigma, our Global Business Services and the IT transformation. Because of our 2015 performance and our expectations that we will sustain strong margins in the U.S. and China and break even in Europe this year, we already announced just last month that we had increased our projected 2016 earnings per share adjusted to between $5.25 and $5.75. Before I close my initial comments, I also want to comment that we know there's been a lot written about the U.S. industry being at peak levels and that a downturn is imminent. We, like many others, do not share this view. Chuck is going to go into a little bit more detail on this, but we believe the industry fundamentals support a continued strong U.S. industry. Having said that, we understand that we are in a cyclical business and it's very difficult for anyone to project the timing of a downturn, and while we feel we are very well-positioned to take advantage of the strong market with important new product launches, we also have an intense focus on both costs and capital efficiencies to ensure that we will maximize earnings and cash flow through the cycle and are best prepared for whenever a downturn does occur. So, in summary, we delivered our 2015 commitment despite a number of unforeseen headwinds. And we are on track to achieve our 2016 targets across key financial metrics and we believe we are well positioned for profitable growth that will continue to drive shareholder value. We now we are in the midst of an industry that is being disruptive and we are aggressively leveraging our technology leadership and our global resources to lead that disruption. We'll continue to strengthen our core business and we'll also continue to invest in game changers that are necessary for GM to lead the future of personal mobility. This team is committed to delivering results. We delivered on our commitment in 2014 and 2015 and that is exactly what we plan to do in 2016 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter in GM's full-year results. Without a doubt, a very strong results achieved in the fourth quarter capped an outstanding year for the company. In fact, a number of key financial metrics such as net income, consolidated EBIT-adjusted, consolidated EBIT-adjusted margin, North American EBIT-adjusted, and North American-EBIT adjusted margins established records not only for the fourth quarter, but also for the full-year. From an operating perspective, EBIT-adjusted results for the year grew to a record $10.8 billion, up $1.5 billion versus 2014, adjusting 2014 for the impact of recalls. The EBIT-adjusted margins of 7.1% is up 110 basis points year-over-year on the same basis. And our adjusted earnings per share for 2015 was up 65% to $5.02, another record comparable with 2014 are up 22% year-over-year after adjusting 2014 for recalls. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvements during the year. Clearly, this team is committed to delivering on improving the company's profitability going forward. The strong earnings growth enabled significant capital returns to our owners as well, $5.7 billion in total between dividend and share repurchases in 2015. Turning to cash flow, cash flow for the quarter and ultimately the year was adversely impacted by cash settlements for various litigation settlements, increased capital spending and UAW ratification bonuses. With that said, we are still very much on track for a significant increase in free cash flow in 2016. And I'll talk more about 2016 in just a couple of minutes. Although, we're very pleased with our overall performance in 2015, we continue to take additional actions to drive efficiency into the business to ensure the positive momentum continues. As Mary mentioned, we expect to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018 across the entire business. We expect these savings will more than offset incremental investments in engineering, brand building and technology-related costs. All of these cost efficiencies are underpinned by operational excellence. A corporate initiative which will drive common tools, common processes, but most importantly a continuous improvement mentality throughout our organization. The GM team is very focused on carrying our positive momentum forward across the business. Okay, moving on. Just a few comments on a couple of our regions. First, China. The company sustained strong operating results in 2015, which is consistent with the guidance we provided to you as we progressed through the year. Despite an industry that moderated during much of the year, we generated strong full-year performance, $2.1 billion in equity income and 9.5% net margins. We were able to generate these results specifically because we've been proactively managing the market risks with several actions such as optimizing mix by increasing production of our SUVs to meet demand, aggressively reducing costs by rolling out cost down, efficiency-up initiatives and working proactively with our dealers to manage inventory levels. Although, we're encouraged that China has cut the purchase tax, it has provided a tailwind to the industry. Our plan is to continue to proactively manage the market risks as we've been doing to protect the profitability of our business. For the year, we expect the industry in China to grow in the mid-single-digit range, which will support our efforts to sustain our strong operating performance. With regard to North America, clearly, the region posted some impressive numbers for the quarter and the year. For the fourth quarter, EBIT-adjusted and an EBIT-adjusted margins of $2.8 billion and 10%, respectively, again, both Q4 records. For the year, we achieved EBIT-adjusted of $11 billion and a corresponding margin of 10.3%, both establishing full-year records for the region. Obviously, achieving the 10% margin was a great accomplishment, especially one year ahead of our long-standing 2016 commitment. The strong performance in North America for GM as well as the industry in general has sparked a debate whether the U.S. industry is peaking or plateauing. The bears argue the industry in the U.S. has peaked and is ready to roll over. They often cite the fact that the U.S. auto industry is in 7th year of expansion, margins are as good as they get, and a recession is right around the corner, really more akin to a scenario that we saw in 2007. On the other hand, a number of people, including GM, believe the industry is plateauing with many years of strong performance ahead, similar to the 2000 to 2007 timeframe after the industry peaked in 2000. We believe industry fundamentals, such as the age of the vehicle fleet, firm used car pricing, credit availability, and low fuel prices remains supportive, and overall car manufacturers are in much better health, lower inventory levels, lower breakeven points, strong capacity utilization. In addition, household balance sheets are strong, the labor market continues to improve, and forecasts are calling for the U.S. economy to continue its expansion, albeit, at a slow and steady pace. Combining strong industry fundamentals with the positive economic backdrop gives us confidence the industry can sustain a strong SAAR in the mid-17 million unit range for a number of years. With that said, we are also very aware that downturns are difficult to predict. That is why we are planning and running the business accordingly. In essence, proactively managing the cycle. So, what have we done? Over the past number of years, we have maintained our intense focus on cost efficiency and capital deployment. We've generated significant efficiencies over the past number of years with even more expected in 2016. As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, we are well on our way to drive about $5.5 billion of run rate cost efficiency improvements by 2018, more than offsetting cost headwinds. We've made tough decisions on capital deployment, which includes our downside protection. These decisions included exiting markets where we had no path to viable returns. Our breakeven point in the U.S. has been maintained at an industry level of between 10 million and 11 million units as we've kept our fixed costs flat over the past number of years. And we've refrained from taking volume and share as we focused on profitable retail growth. U.S. dealer inventories have been proactively managed down. As Mary indicated, they're down over 100,000 units or 14% compared with year-end 2014. In addition, and probably an area not mentioned enough, we have a much more flexible workforce, enabling us to react to market dynamics and take costs out more aggressively compared with past cycles. And finally, although keeping cost out of the system and looking for efficiencies are big drivers to protecting profitability in downturns, we are also executing several growth opportunities such as GM Financial, Aftersales, OnStar and Global Cadillac that are somewhat independent of the vehicle cycle, fundamentally to improve our quality of earnings, peak-to-trough. We believe execution of our proactive downturn planning will enable sustained performance through the cycle. Moving on to our outlook for 2016. Big picture, we expect to deliver profit growth, margin expansion and an increased free cash flow. This will translate into EPS-adjusted of between $5.25 and $5.75 per share and free cash generation of about $6 billion, all consistent with the guidance we provided in mid-January. We'll also expect a similar cadence of earnings as we've seen in the past several years. Q1 will be seasonably weaker, Q2 and Q3 stronger, and Q4 about average. With that said, important to point out that our Q1 results in North America will be impacted by approximately $250 million in restructuring costs. The restructuring is related to the negotiated attrition program with the UAW, which will lead to cost efficiencies going forward. And cash flow should also follow its normal seasonality pattern, with Q1 expected to be generally in line with the first quarter of 2015. To sum it up, we had a great quarter, a great 2015. And we expect to achieve even better results in 2016 based on our current view of the macro environment. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move on to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you. Operator. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just on the slide, talking about managing through the cycle, certainly we agree with your view on the cycle as well. I'd love to get a sense, given some of the weakness we're seeing just in car segments that's being offset by trucks; how are you seeing that the production incentive discipline in car segments? GM's kept its inventory there pretty low, but what kind of competitive environment are you seeing and kind of modeling for in your outlook for 2016 in those segments? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think, first and foremost, from a macro perspective, we expect lower for longer gas prices which will continue to support, obviously, the strong full-size pick-up, full-size SUV and crossover mix that we've seen, which then gets to the heart of your question, Itay, which is what happens from a passenger car perspective. And I think the key there is really, as you said, to maintain very strong discipline around inventory, aligning supply and demand. I would say the other thing that's important to know, in 2015, North America, 10.3% margins with the oldest passenger car and crossover lineup in the industry. And over the next two years, we will cycle through all of those products including the Malibu that we're in the midst of launching, the Cruze, the compact crossovers, the Equinox Terrain and the mid-crossovers. And as we've said before, our expectations are the profit of those vehicles will be significantly better than the vehicles that they replace, and it's not all price. A significant portion of that is cost efficiency and probably the $5.5 billion of efficiencies that we're driving. So, I think that, yes, it's a more difficult dynamic for passenger cars, but with our launch cadence we think that that is still going to be a tailwind for earnings in 2016 and 2017. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful, Chuck. And then maybe one follow-up kind of strategic question. Looking to get a little bit more color on the Maven launch, particularly how that interplays with GM's investment in Lyft. And then, I mean, do you think overall \u2013 when you think about the work you're doing on Level 3 automated vehicles and the Bolt, does that give GM some advantage in terms of pursuing ridesharing more aggressively than others? And just kind of how all those factors interplay with what you're doing with Maven and Lyft. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, so a great question. And as we look at it, there's going to be ridesharing and car-sharing opportunities. And the partnership we have with Lyft is very important from a short-term, as I mentioned, of being able to provide the short-term-use vehicles for Lyft drivers. One of the biggest issues they have in getting drivers is drivers that have the appropriate vehicles to participate as a Lyft driver. So that's a clear opportunity that I think will allow us both to grow. But when we got \u2013 started talking to Lyft, we believe that together, we first share a common view of how autonomous will be enabled. And we think it will start in a ridesharing type of application because you can ring fence it and really control the environment that you're doing that. And we believe that what Lyft brings to the party with really understanding the demand cycle from a sharing perspective and what we can bring from a technical perspective that we can do that quickly and also do it to our standards of the highest levels of safety as we implement this new technology into the marketplace, but do it in a controlled fashion. So we do think that we have an opportunity there. Clearly, the Bolt plays into it because there's a lot of interest in using electric vehicles to do that. So we think we have strength there. As it relates to Maven, as we've talked about in the past, we had several pilots of Drive New York City, which we actually saw a very strong acceptance due to the fact that we're going to be expanding that, and as we've mentioned also, launching into a city. And so we see these as additional opportunities that not only are \u2013 get more piloting in North America but something that will have global appeal. Also have a car-sharing activity going on with CarUnity in Europe and then what we announced in China as well. So when we take all this collective learning and the sharing space, it's allowing us to really create a platform that is going to allow us to have a relationship with the customer however they want to, rideshare, car-share or still very much supportive of the owner/driver model. So we do think the aggressive pace that we're working on both with Lyft and with our Maven activities is going to allow us to lead. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. Thanks so much, everyone. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Okay. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of maybe details or housekeeping questions for me. One, Chuck, sorry if I missed it, but usually in North America you've given the pricing component for both majors and carryovers. I didn't see that in the slides. Is there any further detail you could provide there? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. You're speaking specifically to the fourth quarter, Joe? Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. In North America, yes. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Pricing in the fourth quarter overall was flat, so we didn't call that out. But I would say as we talked about for 2015, not a lot of major pricing. We expect to see that obviously in 2016 amp up with all the product launches and fundamentally offsetting carryover. Order of magnitude plus/minus $200 million each way, $200 million on majors to the good, $200 million on carryover to the bad. Calendar year pricing on carryover very, very consistent with what we talked about before. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then as we think about 2016, because of your new launch cadence, you think that sort of comes out to a net positive? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Absolutely. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then the second question just on China, the net income margins. I think the absolute value of equity income was strong or better than we were looking for. The margins, I guess, down a tick year-over-year. Can you just help us with a little bit \u2013 some of the factors within that? Specifically pricing, which we know has been under pressure there for a while. Has it deteriorated any further? Are we still sort of down that mid single-digits level? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Well, overall, our net income margins in China on a consolidated basis went from 9.8% to 9.5% 2015 versus 2014. There are a vast majority of a number of moving pieces in there including SGMW and SGM. I would say by-and-large, as we talked about before maintaining our net income margins between 9% and 10%, the tailwinds clearly, volume, mix and material costs, fundamentally offsetting price headwinds and incremental fixed costs associated with the ramp up, primarily related to D&A as we continue to build our manufacturing capabilities. From a market perspective in 2015, net price ended up generally in the range of a negative 5%, again, which we fundamentally offset. And I would suggest net pricing, and at least from a planning perspective in the 3% to 5% range in 2016. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. It's very helpful. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. A first question as we think about the guidance going forward as well as share buyback. If you buy back a similar level of shares in 2016 that you did in 2015, which seems reasonably conservative given where the stock is at this point, you're basically looking at about a 7% uptick from a share count shrinking, which gets you to the low end of your guidance range, which indicates you probably have about a 7% core earnings growth to get to the high-end of your guidance range. So it just seems like you're not assuming anything to heroic on the core earnings power. And I was just curious if you could maybe confirm that and also sort of directionally give us some guidance on the regional earnings for 2016 for the major buckets. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. To your first question, John, our capital allocation framework is transparent, so it's a reasonably easy to figure out what we're going to do. To the extent that we generate available free cash flow in 2016. We'll be buying shares as expeditiously as possible, similar to what we did in 2015. I'm not going to confirm the number. You were implying share buybacks of $3.5 billion. We will buy back whatever we can as quickly as we can based on the cash generation of the business. I would say when we looked at our guidance of $5.25 to $5.75, a significant portion of that was being driven by operating performance on a year-over-year basis, and that's what we're focused on driving. When we gave our guidance, we said improved overall EBIT, improved overall EBIT margins, which implies, in my view, a significant improvement year-over-year. Relative to regions, I would just say the following : Again, in the context of company, guidance and improved profitability, improved margins and improved EPS that we would expect to see sustained, strong performance in North America. Clearly, that's going to be a key component of that improvement and continuing strong performance, sustained strong performance in China and our longstanding commitment of breakeven in Europe. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's very helpful. Then just a second question around sort of your cycle discussion. Obviously, there's a lot of concerns around credit metrics and the idea that credit might be overextended. Doesn't seem to be bearing out in the data, particularly when we look at the 30-day delinquencies you have at GM Financial being down on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter. Is there anything else that you are seeing in the credit metrics at GM Financial or broadly in the market that would lead you to believe there is a credit issue that's burgeoning? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: There's nothing that we're seeing. Obviously, that's something that we monitor and track on a global basis as well as the U.S. And the credit metrics are stable and performing, frankly, better than prior to the last downturn. And just thinking about the economic drivers of auto sales. I mean, there are seven different key measures that are economic staff tracks, and I'm sure it's not inconsistent with external. And of the seven factors, we are viewing the impact six out of seven is positive for continued strong growth. And at the end of the day, consumer credit flow and auto loan delinquency rates are both positive. So, we've just not seen anything from a fundamentals perspective that would support that a significant downturn is imminent either from an industry standpoint or from an overall economic standpoint. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just lastly, as we think of the partnership or investment in Lyft, relative to some of the investments that have been made in adjacent businesses historically, GM's had sort of a long track record of monetizing these businesses historically. As you get involved with Lyft and other outside companies do you envision an exit strategy at some point down the line five to 10 years? Or are these really investments that are going to be core to your operations going forward and going to continue to be held for the long term? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. That's a good question, John, and I think it is too early to take a view on that because at the end of the day, it depends on how much is integrated with the business. We talked about OnStar before as being very, very integral to the business. It's early days with Lyft. We think there's significant opportunity in this alliance going forward. That's why we put the $500 million stake into the company. How that manifests itself 5, 10 years down the road, don't know. And I would suggest that that same would apply for Maven or some of these other things. We just don't know how those business models are going to develop but we do think that there's significant opportunity in the future. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Galves with Credit Suisse. Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. This question may sound a little bit strange, but it seems like your U.S. inventories may be a little bit lower or a little bit too low. Are you guys experiencing any significant production constraints or was this kind of a planned drawdown of inventory? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. This is no-win situation, right? As you put it. I think we're reasonably comfortable with inventory levels kind of across the board. Clearly, at any point in time, on any given product or any given trend level, there could be some constraints. But it is not inhibiting sales. And frankly, as we were thinking about the business, we proactively took the actions to drive the inventory down, to make sure that we were well-positioned as a cyclical company for when the downturn happens, and it will happen at some point. We're certainly not foreseeing it, but very rarely do people predict these things accurately. And just to size up, what that means, from a financial perspective, you know what happens in a downturn, first thing is inventory is drawn down at a dealer, and then the factory units sales kind of catch up with the SAAR levels. By really focusing on efficiency and inventory taking this 800,000 units or 100,000 units out and maintaining that discipline, that's worth about $1 billion of downside protection from an earnings and cash flow perspective versus where we were at the end of 2014. So, another example of a proactive action that we've taken. Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. That's super helpful. And then it just seemed a little bit odd that in January the incentive activity for GM seemed to tick up. Is that an aberration or was there a specific programs you can call out? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Sure. One month is not a trend and specific to January, we are selling down Cruze, we're selling down Malibu, we're selling down SRX, we're selling down LaCrosse. This is natural as you transition from one product to another. And I would expect to see incentive spend moderate as we go through this quarter. I think the other important thing is we've got a six-year track record of incentive discipline and I think that carries more weight than a one-month, very specific sell-downs associated with a new model launch cadence. Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. And just one more quick one if I could. On the cost side in North America, if you back out this $300 million \u2013 it seemed like it was some reversal of a restructuring charge. It looked like overall costs were up $1 billion or so year-over-year. It's the first time that's kind of outstripped the material cost savings. Can you give us any color on kind of what were the main buckets of cost increases, and where do you see these lines in 2016 on a year-over-year basis? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Sure. I think, let's start at 10,000 feet and work our way down to the details. First, 10% margins in the fourth quarter, up significantly year-over-year. So, obviously, the business is running very efficiently at a total system level. Fixed costs, overall in 2015 versus 2014, relatively flat and very consistent with what we done in North America over the last number of years. There'll always be noise year-over-year on variable-type fixed costs like incentive compensation and things like that. But fundamentally, the core fixed costs flat year-over-year. Specific to the \u2013 and I presume that you're talking about the $400 million call-out box for others. There are a lot of moving pieces in there. So, yeah. First, the $300 million kind of reversal of the supplemental unemployment benefit is included in there as well as the absence of a $200 million gain that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014 on a supplier recovery. There's also a negative $100 million associated with the lump sum that we paid to retirees based on the UAW agreement. There are some warranty adjustments associated with base vehicle warranty adjustments, and those are always pluses and minuses in any quarter. There are some incremental D&A and then a lot of miscellaneous items. But I think the big picture, Dan, is very, very focused on maintaining our fixed cost structure. We did that in 2015, and we expect to do that again in 2016. Daniel V. Galves - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. I had a couple of things. One is I was hoping you could give us some additional color on how the 2016 bridge in China may look. In the fourth quarter, you had an earnings up on a 19% increase in wholesales, and I think you said you're expecting 2016 to be something like 4% for the year. So, if we think about a couple of the buckets like volume and pricing, how does that sort of shake out? And does your commentary about sustained strong performance basically mean you're guiding to maintaining this equity earnings level? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I think the development of 2016 will \u2013 kind of the drivers of the profitability will be very, very consistent with 2015. Volumes are going to be up, I mean, assuming the industry performs as we expect, we expect low-single digit call it 3% to 4% growth in the industry year-over-year. So, that'll be an improvement. Mix will be favorable again as we continue to launch new Cadillacs and new SUVs into the market, as a matter of fact, we have 13 new launches of key products not only in SUVs and crossovers but some pretty critical passenger cars. Price, as I've mentioned before, is going to be a headwind, directionally, in the range of 3% to 5%. Obviously, from a planning perspective, we're taking actions to make sure we're covering the 5%. Material costs will be favorable and fixed costs will go up because we are bringing two new plants on line. We'll have the full year impact of that. Net-net. Rod, as we said, we expect to sustain strong equity income performance and strong margins in China, and we generated $2.1 billion in 2015. So, that kind of gives you the floor. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And another question I had was on GM Financial and the credit market trends. There was a senior loan officer survey released yesterday that showed some modest tightening of credit standards. And as I'm sure you're aware, there's been some evidence of widening spreads in CDS and subprime ABS. Are you, at this point, suggesting that this is not meaningful enough to have any real implications for the market as far as you're looking at things? And can you remind us what percentage of your originations nowadays are subprime? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. To your first question Rod, what specifically are you asking for input on? Relative to access to capital, cost of capital? Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Well, benchmarks are up and spreads are up a bit, right? So I'm sure you guys are paying attention to that. So what is that \u2013 when you look at that and you think about what the implications are for the market for your own originations and for the market's originations, are there any as far as you can tell? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: No material implications from our perspective. We, obviously, expect another year of growth. From GMF perspective, we are now fully 100% responsible for running subvented financing as well as leasing through GMF. Thus far, availability has been no problem as far as access to capital, so very much on plan from that perspective. Obviously, our cost of funds and some of that is increasing, which we will either pass along to customers in higher payments or it'll go back to the North American team, from a support perspective, but again, that's factored into our thinking and our guidance. When you look at the GMF business today, about 80% of the originations are prime or near-prime and 20% are sub-prime. That percentage of total originations, obviously, has been coming down as we've been bridging to the full captive and I expect that percentage to go down on a go-forward basis. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. And just one last housekeeping question. I think your North American production was up something like 25,000 units in the quarter. Your wholesales were 64,000. Is the difference rental program units that are being returned? I'm just trying to reconcile the volume benefit with the 600 million of volume \u2013 the earnings improvement from volume that you had in the quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. That would be rental, the difference between that. I mean, obviously, at the end of the day you have production plus imports, less exports, and then whatever happens from a net rental car impact. And the net rental car impact going to auction versus going in, because we've been winding that, obviously, with sales down, is about 50,000 units in the fourth quarter. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. It just looked like a big volume \u2013 600 million is a big volume benefit year-over-year if a part of that is the rental return accounting? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. But remember, the way volume is calculated, it's volume increase at the average variable profit rate, and then obviously mix is impacted because you're selling more rental car fleets, which are lower profit than the average. So, you've got to kind of always look at those two in combination. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh, okay. So you put that into the mix? Great. Okay, thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yup. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt Stover with SIG. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you very much. Excuse me. I wanted to ask about the incentives as we move into next year. I take your comment onboard, Chuck, about GM being pretty disciplined in incentives throughout this cycle and a lot of the increases over the last year related to run-out of old product. However, you did \u2013 or at least third-party sources suggest that we did see an increase in pickup truck incentives. I'm just trying to think about the arithmetic as we look into next year. Should the natural increase that we see in pickup truck incentives not offset the improvements that we see in the other products? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That's a pretty tough question to answer without being able to have foresight on what happens in the truck industry through the whole year. I would say the following, Matt. Our trucks performed very well in 2015. Going against some brand new products in the market, we grew share. The 2015 trucks were more profitable than in 2014. We just launched a significantly refreshed truck at the tail end of 2015. And supply and demand, and especially our supply position remained very, very strong. So, I am not foreseeing a significant headwind year-over-year from a truck pricing perspective. As a matter of fact, last year we were able to actually take price increases on trucks. So I think that sitting here, February 3, that 2016 pricing for trucks will probably be relatively benign year-over-year. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Would you guys be \u2013 I mean, if you think about pressures in the market in that area, you see Ram running incentives way up in the market. Ford's added capacity on the F-150. And would you be willing, in the context of that, to hold tight on share? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: The truck industry itself, very, very competitive. Obviously, it's not a place where you want to give up share easily. But I would be \u2013 I think we would be erring on maintaining share and maintaining profitability as opposed to chasing incremental share in 2016. Especially because we are running at a very, very tight level of supply and demand right now from a truck standpoint, and our truck inventory, at least, I wouldn't use January 31 days' supply because of the low sales rate, but our truck inventory at the end of December was 60 days, which is like 20 days or 30 days below historical levels. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. And the last question is just on the incremental improvement in costs in the $5.5 billion number. Where are we in that journey right now? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: In 2015, we generated about $2.3 billion from a material cost, and I'm talking about commercial performance, not raw materials, and $300 million in logistics, so about $2.3 billion. We also picked up a couple of hundred million dollars in Global Business Services and other SG&A initiatives. So, we're about $2.5 billion against $5.5 billion, a little bit more than 40% of the way through the year. And we expect to make another significant step in 2016. And I'd also suggest that that was our first run at this. We continue to look very hard across our entire cost structure, including global benchmarking, manufacturing costs, SG&A costs with external sources. So, I wouldn't be surprised if that $5.5 billion doesn't change over time as we work our way through the next couple of years. Matthew Stover - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Thank you. I appreciate that. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Any color on South America? You were pretty close to breakeven this quarter. How should we think about the cadence as we go into the next year? And what are the big savings drivers that we went through the year? Is there any sort of seasonal help in Q4? I don't usually think that's the case. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: South America has been and will continue to be, at least through 2016, a very, very challenging environment, very volatile, very difficult to predict. With that said, the actions that we've been taking over the last number of years was done specifically to establish a business foundation that would give us significant opportunities on the upside going forward. I would expect to see some improvement in South America in 2016 versus 2015 based on the run rate savings that we've generated in 2015. We reduced the workforce about 20%. We'll continue to take whatever actions are necessary, but very, very difficult to predict because it's a very volatile environment in South America. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Is there anything, though, in Q4 that is seasonally positive relative to the rest? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Not really seasonally positive. I think we had strong market performance in the fourth quarter. Would suggest that so far \u2013 at least one month is in in January, we continue to have strong performance. But I just think it's really a very, very difficult environment to sit there and say, hey, here's our outlook for the year and provide a specific bridge. Our objective is to improve our performance in South America in 2016 versus 2015. That's our objective. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And how about GMIO ex-China? You're still losing money on a consolidated basis. I believe it was March of last year you were targeting getting South America and IO, ex-China, back to breakeven. Do you think you could do that in the short term and what is the path to profitability there? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, talking again, the South America first. I think we're very well-positioned in South America, especially Brazil, when you talk about the products and the strengths of the product that we have down there that's performing very well. When you talk about the brand and when you talk about the dealer network and then overlay on that, the restructuring and other actions we've taken. To me, South America breakeven ultimately profitability there is totally contingent upon a macro improvement. And I think that's a little bit different than the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia. We are in the midst of executing a number of restructurings as you know. Australia manufacturing take \u2013 reducing our manufacturing presence in Thailand and Indonesia. But, as I've said in the past, one of the challenges that we have in consolidated operations in Asia is the product portfolio, the brand health and the dealer network need to also improve. So that was going to be a longer tale to address all of those issues. So, clearly, we're going to invest only where we can make a viable return over time. We're the taking the actions in consolidated operations to position the business for that. I just don't see breakeven in the near-term. That's more of a longer term issue and those operations that we're participating in and in those markets that we're participating in. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just one last question. The results today had the reversal of a valuation allowance associated with Europe. I guess that's a positive sign for the outlook for European profitability. Any color on what it might do to the overall tax rate, though, going forward on a GAAP basis? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: No, no impact on our effective tax rate from a GAAP basis and we still expect in 2016 for that to be in the mid-20% range. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Ryan. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, I think your practice is to amortize the increased cost of UAW contract over the contract's life, as opposed to Ford's which is to expense much of it in 4Q. And either approach is accepted and yours seems more consistent with the matching principle, but by not taking a single charge it also makes it a little bit more difficult for us to gauge the actual cost increase. Is there anything you can say now about the cost of the contract? And what we should think about putting it in our models in 2016 versus 2015? And finally, I remember Mary saying at the conference in October that GM wouldn't sign anything that wouldn't allow you to generate 10% margin in North America. So maybe just kind of cast in the light of your overall margins in North America. Thanks. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well. Okay. So, going through the last point first. The agreement that we have with UAW most definitely will not impede our 10% margins in North America. And again, step back and think about our U.S. hourly workforce cost in the U.S. is $5.5 billion. So, look at that in the context of the agreement that we reached and everything else. You're talking about economics that are a couple of hundred million dollars a year. And clearly, as we think about productivity, other efficiencies that we're driving through operations excellence and everything else, our expectations are that we're going to not only offset. I would suggest work to more than offset the incremental impact of the UAW agreement, which at the end of the day, means no impact to our 10% margins. The other important thing is we do have more flexibility associated with the UAW agreement which improves our downside protection going forward because we can react much quicker to the market. So, overall, relatively immaterial economic impact in the context of the overall GM North American results. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's great to hear. And then my last question is just on China. On slide 27 you talked about increasing market share in China. And that compares to the narrative earlier in 2015, right, that the domestic Chinese manufacturers were gaining market share at the expense of some of the foreign JVs, maybe because they had greater availability of Crossover utility vehicles or strength in Tier 4 cities relatively. So can you talk about how you were able to gain share there on a full-year basis, your product cadence in China, overall and specific to utilities? And then just lastly, still on China, but comment a bit please on the sustainability of the current run rate of sales and what your house view is on the strength in 4Q, whether that pulls from 2016, or whether it pulls from 2017 after the tax incentives expire. Thanks a lot. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, again, going backwards, January, just to answer the last question did we pull ahead sales into Q4. Generally, Q4 is a pretty strong sales month for China. That's seasonally \u2013 there's a lot of launches. As we said, there's a lot of promotions in Q4. If you look at the margins in China, not just for us but the industry over the last three years, Q4 they have a tendency to moderate a bit just because of that. But, with that said, January sales, the industry was up 10% year-over-year and we were up 12% year-over-year based on preliminary numbers. So, it appears that we're starting the year off reasonably well, given the slower growth in China. We grew share in China in 2015 because we launched a number of great products, especially in segments that we have been underrepresented, and that includes Crossovers and SUVs both at SGM and SGMW. The Baojun brand grew hundreds of percentage points of sales on a year-over-year basis and if memory serves, we sold just under 500,000 in 2015 versus something less than 200,000 in 2014. And we have 13 products that we're launching across China in 2016 including Cadillac-locally produced XT5s and other crossovers. So, great products. Strong brands, especially Buick, Wuling. Growing brands like Baojun and Cadillac gives us confidence that we'll be able to grow share again in 2016 versus 2015. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for all that color. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. A follow-up on some of the discussion around how you're seeing the passenger car, particularly the small and mid-sedan market developing in the U.S. It seems like consumers are voting against it. I certainly understand that with your product launches you're going to buck the trend a bit in terms of price, but just in terms of capacity production volumes, A), how are you thinking about that market over the next couple of years? Two, with kind of defocusing, at least in 4Q and 1Q January, on rental cars sales. Is that kind of related to where you think either your capacity or maybe your just retail mix is going there? And then, three, just a strategic question. Since the industry has been through several \u2013 light truck pivoting to passenger car back to light truck, now back to passenger car and then back to light truck cycles, how are you thinking about mid-term flexibility, vis- \u00e0-vis your manufacturing base? And in particular, why aren't there more factories \u2013 and it's not just you, it's most of the industry \u2013 that can flex between the two product lines? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, so the last question first and I'll try to remember all the other three or four. It's really hard to flex between passenger cars and trucks because one is a body and the other one is a frame vehicle and they're completely different manufacturing (58:59). Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I mean, light trucks like CUV, sorry. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Pardon? Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I mean like CUVs versus sedans in the same plant. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Okay, well. Again, different manufacturing processes and clearly, we try to build as much flexibility as possible into manufacturing, but every time you build flexibility, there's incremental investment to do that from a tooling perspective. So, you want to do that as efficiently as possible. I think, again, starting with your initial question, over the next number of years, it's likely that there is a \u2013 more of a permanent shift from passenger cars to crossovers. And that's great for us. We have very strong portfolio and a very strong franchise when we think about both compact small and importantly, medium crossovers. And we're going through entire launch cadence on that. That has been factored into our thinking. It's factored into our thinking when we deploy capital, factored into our tooling rates in the plants and everything else. And we have taken a number of actions when you think about the current strengths of crossovers to get the incremental production. For instance, with the Equinox and Terrain for the last two or three years, we built, we started a flex actively in Spring Hill in Oshawa to support our production in CAMI. So we're constantly looking at the optimization of our production footprint, vis-\u00e0-vis where the market is going over a long period of time. But I think you're right that ultimately, there will be a permanent shift just because crossovers and SUVs are exactly what the name implies, much more utility than the traditional passenger cars. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And so are you still comfortable with the $1,500 profit improvement on Malibu and Cruze, or is that sort of the baseline lower now just given some of the headwinds in pricing and the overall sedan marketplace? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I think that's still directionally correct. I mean, we're one month into the launch. I think, again, looking at the track record of what we've done when we've launched new products that are significantly better than the vehicle that they replace. And clearly, the Malibu and the Cruze are significantly better than the vehicles that they're replacing. We have a tendency to have a track record of growing segments here, growing transaction prices, and improving our profitability. We would expect to do that with these products. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And I see them moving away from daily rental mix as well on those segments? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, certainly. I mean, one of the objectives of moving away from daily rental is to make sure you're optimizing your capacity and generating as high a return as possible. And those vehicles traditionally have carried a bit heavier weight of daily rentals, so we're very focused on retail. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. And again, I want to thank, everybody, for joining us this morning and just quickly want to reiterate that we are going to continue to execute our plan with discipline, to drive profitable growth, to improve our cash generation and deliver improved returns to our shareholders, while funding the technologies that will drive our future and allow us to do that over the long-term. So, again, thanks for your participation today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded, Thursday, April 21, 2016. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Executive Director of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy C. Arickx - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast on the Internet. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we've included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Randy, and thanks, everyone for joining the call. I'm extremely pleased to report that GM delivered a very strong performance in this quarter. So let's take a look at the numbers. As the highlights and year-over-year improvements include, first, revenue of $37.3 billion, up $1.6 billion. Q1 record, EBIT adjusted of $2.8 billion, which is up $0.6 billion, Q1 record EBIT-adjusted margin of 7.1%, up 1.3 percentage points, and Q1 record earnings per share adjusted of $1.26, up 47%. Our net income was $2 billion; this is also up a $1 billion. And in addition, our record 28.5% ROIC on a trailing four-quarter basis demonstrates the positive results of our disciplined capital allocation framework. If we look we've returned $0.9 billion to shareholders as of March 31, and this really underscores our commitment to enhancing shareholder value over time. I think it's also important to take note that in Q1, we saw improved performance in all of our segments, led by North America, continued strength in China and breakeven results in Europe. We've had positive developments for Chevrolet and Cadillac, which are our two global brands. To start with, in the United States, Chevrolet retail share was up a full point year-over-year to about 11%. Malibu's best Q1 retail sales since 1980 in the U.S. and in March, 85% of Malibu sales were the all-new models. In addition, we are launching the Cruze and very excited about that reception in the marketplace. In China, the Malibu XL flagship sedan is also key to growing the brand in China from a Chevrolet perspective, and again this vehicle is getting good reception. And from a Cadillac perspective, in the first quarter, our ATPs were the highest in North America in our history, and we're very excited about the Cadillac CT6 and the Cadillac XT5 that are now launching in both China and the United States. From a North America perspective, U.S. retail sales are up 7% year-over-year, largely on Chevrolet and Buick performances. U.S. retail market share grew faster than any other automaker, up 1.1 percentage points to 16.6%. And ATPs of $34,600 exceeded the industry average by about $3,500. And ending total dealer inventory was down 13% year-over-year. If we move to China with our joint venture partners, we delivered over 963,000 vehicles, up slightly from Q1 2015, thanks to the growth in SUV and the luxury segment. The Buick Envision sales more than doubled and when we include the Baojun 560, total SUV sales jumped 148%. We're also very excited about the new Buick LaCrosse sedan that was introduced, that can continue to build on the strength of Buick in China. And our Cadillac sales continue to raise, up 6.1% in the quarter, on top of 17%, which was the full-year increase last year. In Europe, we broke even in Q1 and we are on plan to breakeven for the calendar year. And this is really driven by Opel's product offensive. Opel/Vauxhall sales were 309,000, up 8.4% year-over-year, outpacing the industry and this is really on the strength of the Astra, which was made Europe's 2016 Car of the Year. Market share was up in 15 of the 21 markets and these are \u2013 the increases are in most of the major markets across Europe. And we still have two very important product launches in Europe this year, the Astra Sports Tourer and the Mokka X. In South America, operating performance improved because of our continued work and especially the focus last year on rightsizing the business, while protecting the new product pipeline. And if you look at GM Financial; GM Financial grew its captive presence with GM customers and dealers in all regions with North America increasing its penetration of GM retail sales to 37% in the quarter. This is up from 21% in the first quarter of 2015. And across the company, our operational excellence program, which is really driving Six Sigma and continues improvement in every aspect of the business, is well underway and it's playing a key role in the $5.5 billion cost efficiency challenge that we have outlined and that we expect to achieve by 2018. The success of the core business has enabled us to make smart investments in shaping the future of personal mobility. On the autonomous front, we announced our intent to acquire Cruise Automation to further accelerate the development of autonomous vehicle technology and position General Motors in a leadership role. In car sharing, we introduced Maven, which combines and expands our multiple car sharing program under a single-brand, which includes Maven City and Maven+. Maven City offers cars on demand in key cities driven by on OnStar-powered smartphone connectivity that really provides the customers an ownership-like experience. And Maven+ is a completely dedicated private fleet for residential community. We started this in New York City, as I've talked about it in the past. We're going to soon be adding Chicago and this will give us the potential to reach more than 5,000 residents. On ride-sharing, as you know, we also announced the strategic partnership with Lyft. And it's a four dimensional approach that enables us first to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous cars. And we also introduced Express Drive and this is a short-term rental program on the Lyft platform that makes General Motors cars available to Lyft drivers at affordable rates. It also exposes those passengers and drivers to our products and gets more seats in seats. We have the first launch, which is in Chicago, and demand is eight times the supply. We plan to add hubs in Boston and Baltimore and Washington in the near future. Another aspect of the alliance in the partnership that we have with Lyft is being able to combine the Lyft experience with our vehicle connectivity leadership and this really provides a better experience for the customer. And we also see many opportunities to jointly expand both of our business and present cross-marketing opportunities, and you'll see us taking advantage of those as we move forward. From an alternative propulsion perspective, we also revealed the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV at the Consumer Electronic Show, it's going to achieve more than 200 miles per charge of all EV range and will cost about $30,000 after government incentives, production will begin later this year. So in summary, our strong first quarter gives us even more confidence that we will deliver the earnings growth we outlined in January. We delivered Q1 record EBIT adjusted, EBIT adjusted margins and EPS adjusted, along with a record return on invested capital. Our aggressive product launch cadence and continued cost discipline will help us deliver on our commitments for the year and continue to drive shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. I just wanted to take a couple of minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter. As Mary said, all reporting segments posted improved results from a year ago, including about $500 million of improvement outside North America. Clearly, we're on track for another record year in 2016, very much in line with the overview we provided back in January. Just a few comments on our results by region. First, let me start with North America. North America continues to put up impressive numbers. We continue to see steady moderate industry growth in the U.S. of approximately 3% and we expect that trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion was a first quarter record, up over $100 million from a year ago, despite over $200 million in restructuring expense and the increased launch-related costs. The success of our important launches like the Chevrolet Malibu and Cruze, as well as material and cost efficiencies will help more than offset higher D&A, marketing and engineering-related costs throughout the year, as we continue to invest in our portfolio and brands. And as we've said before, we expect to maintain 10% plus margins for the calendar year, while delivering improved EBIT-adjusted performance compared to 2015. Shifting to Europe, we are very pleased with the breakeven results in Europe, more than a $200 million improvement year-over-year and we remain very much on track to deliver breakeven results for the full year. We continue to see moderate growth in Europe, where industry volumes were up about 5% year-over-year in the first quarter, and as Mary indicated earlier, Opel/Vauxhall sales outpaced the industry by growing over 8% compared to a year ago. The success of Opel/Vauxhall's recent launches such as the Astra and the Corsa, have contributed to increased wholesales and related top-line growth in the region. We're also very focused on costs where we're utilizing tools such as operational excellence throughout the region and you are seeing some of the results. In regards to earnings cadence for the year, we expect normal seasonality throughout the year, while we continue to manage FX challenges in the region. Moving on to China, another solid quarter with strong equity income of $518 million, about equal to a year ago. While the industry grew roughly 6% in the quarter, our retail sales were roughly flat year-over-year. The quarter was impacted by model changeovers. However, as our launches ramp up, we expect volumes and market share to improve. Our previous guidance, industry growth in the mid-single digit range and our ability to sustain our strong margin performance has not changed and we're very much on track. We also continue to capitalize on improving mix with our strong SUV and MPVs sales, as well as products like the Cadillac CT6 and XT5, while remaining focused on cost efficiencies and driving material cost performance. Turning to South America, EBIT-adjusted improved this quarter versus a year ago by approximately $150 million in a much more challenging economic environment. As you are aware, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging with no near-term recovery in sight. While we're pleased with the developments in Argentina and are seeing positive market signs there, political uncertainty continues in Brazil where industry volumes were down 29% in the first quarter. However, the results of our restructuring actions over the past year contributed to improved results this quarter versus a year ago. We'll continue to take actions to help mitigate the negative headwinds that are impacting the industry and GM's results in that region as appropriate and we are well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it materializes. Finally GMF, we continue to execute our captive strategy and are seeing the results. As Mary mentioned, penetration in the U.S. increased to 37% in the first quarter, up from 21% last year. Revenue grew by $700 million to $2.1 billion in the first quarter, a record, and we earned $225 million in earnings before taxes in the first quarter, another record. Shifting to our capital allocation framework, we continue to focus on driving shareholder value. In the first quarter, we returned $900 million to shareholders, including $600 million in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. We also remain focused on investing in the business. And as Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation will help us build the foundation for driving further shareholder value in the future. And as we indicated earlier this year, we also took steps to further de-risk the balance sheet by contribution $1.5 billion to our U.S. hourly pension plan during the quarter, and just recently finalized another $500 million contribution in April. As you know, the $2 billion contribution was funded with debt, providing the company greater flexibility by pushing out any required pension contributions further into the future. As expected and in line with normal seasonality, Q1 adjusted automotive free cash flow was an outflow of $1.5 billion for the quarter, which was a $200 million improvement versus a year ago. With regard to our total company outlook for the year, we are very much on plan for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company. And we have even more confidence that we will achieve our EPS adjusted guidance of $5.25 to $5.75 for the full year. And we continue to expect growth in adjusted automotive free cash flow to nearly $6 billion in 2016. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : And your first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. A first question just on the pace of buybacks in the quarter. It seemed like it was a little bit light. Obviously, it's a tough working capital quarter, a seasonal quarter for you on cash flow. I'm just curious as we see cash flow ramp up through the course of the year if you continue to see the buybacks as a significant opportunity here? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Sure. And at a minimum what we want to do is complete the committed share buyback program that we announced in the first quarter last year, which was $5 billion through the end of 2016 and per our capital allocation framework, as we generate free cash flow, we are going to buy back shares as expeditiously as possible, but as I said john, at a minimum we want to complete that first $5 billion on our path to the $9 billion upsize that was approved by the board earlier this year. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just a second question as we think of the free cash flow you're showing on slide 23 here. There's a $500 million benefit from equipment on operating leases and I'm assuming that's the gain on vehicles coming back off lease and the residuals performing better than expected. I'm just curious if that is correct and if that's something you think will continue through the course of this year. And what is driving that? Is that just better market conditions or is that better residual performance because nameplates and brands are starting to resonate with consumers? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, John, that is essentially related to daily rental fleet and that is related to fewer units being placed into service. When you look at the impact of daily rental and cash flow, you need to look at both the equipment on operating leases and accrued and other liabilities and inventory. So, it kind of shows up in three different places. We can provide you with a little bit more specificity around that, but that has nothing to do with lease residuals on vehicles that are being leased through GMF, obviously that flows through GMF results. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's... Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: But with that said, we are seeing \u2013 continue to see positive results on lease terminations from a GMF perspective. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just lastly, it sounds like the Baojun brand is helping you out quite a bit in China and it's sort of a great example of a purpose-specified brand in a market. As we think about sort of potentially the need for a purpose-specified brand in the electrical vehicle market, is there ever a consideration to brand the Bolt or the Volt a different brand and come up with a new angle there because one of the electric-specific companies that's out there has got a good cache in their brand and it does seem like there might be some competitive dynamics that would be solved if you came up with a good new brand there. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah, from a brand perspective, I think when you look at the Chevrolet Volt, to start with a few years back, it's done a lot \u2013 I think, to help increase awareness and consideration and positive views on the Chevrolet brand, so we've been building on that, Chevrolet is a global brand, and it's a full range, when you look at the electrification not only just all-electric with the Bolt, but extended range electric vehicle with the Volt, and even vehicles like the Malibu Hybrid. So, I think we look at it and see it as a \u2013 an opportunity \u2013 to a certain extent, Volt and now Bolt EV are starting to have a level of their own, and we think it really complements the Chevrolet brand globally. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congrats. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Itay. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Just want maybe to start with actually a long-term strategic question. You've had a busy quarter with Lyft, Cruze, Mobilize REM and Maven. I was hoping maybe, Mary, you could kind of provide some color on kind of how investors should think about the magnitude of the long-term opportunity that you're pursuing here, particularly maybe in regions where GM has not historically been well-represented. What's the long-term vision for GM with respect to some of these opportunities that you are pursuing? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I'd say, it hard to size them when you look at how many different people are sizing up, is autonomous going to cause the industry to grow, is it going to shrink it, I think there is too many unknowns, but what I would say is, we see a significant opportunity and that's why we're moving so aggressively on all fronts, when you look at the technology that we're putting into cars, as it relates to connectivity. When you look at what we're doing from a propulsion perspective, not only dramatically improving our technology from an internal combustion engine perspective, but the investments and the leadership position that we have with the Chevrolet Bolt EV to be the first automaker that has the type of range of 200 miles plus at an affordable price of $30,000 after incentives. Then when you look at autonomous and we believe that we'll see autonomous in the marketplace first in a ride-sharing activity for a whole host of reasons of being able to control and grow and learn, we think that's a huge opportunity across the globe to your point. So, I can't specifically size it, but I think it's extremely significant, that's why we're pushing it so aggressively and it builds on top of a strong core business. So, again, I think that'll unfold over time, but we see it as significant. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for Chuck. I know we are still early in the year, the Cruze and Malibu launches, but just how are you feeling, Chuck, around the $1,500 variable profit goal for the year on those metrics? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. We're very much on track with that Itay, based on the reception so far and our expectations and the launch pricing and the delivery of cost as we launch these products. So, we're very much on track. And by the way, continue to be on track along the same dynamic in Europe, with the improved profitability on the Corsa and the Astra that we talked about before. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. Thanks so much, everyone. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Spak with RBC. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. First one is in North America. I think, if my notes are right, this is the first time in maybe even two years that the carryover pricing wasn't a drag. And I guess I just want to sort of confirm what's in that, what's not in that. So the K2 platforms are now in that and is maybe within the carryover. Pricing is sort of still okay there, but some of the others a little bit of a drag. Is that the way to think about it? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, obviously the K2 has been in carryover pricing since the end of 2013, early 2014 as we move through that launch cycle. So, when I look at carryover pricing, I think there is two dynamics. Headwind was really the rundown of model changes. We are getting ready to launch the new Cruze and the new Malibu. From a carryover pricing perspective a positive is, we continue to see price opportunities on full-size trucks and full-size SUVs that we're taking advantage of. So, as we look at the year, it feels to me that carryover pricing will be perhaps a bit less of a headwind than we've seen in the last couple of years. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then the second one is just to follow up on South America, which is clearly a challenged environment. I believe earlier this year you were still looking for improvement there. I don't know exactly what you're thinking in terms of your political expectations for what's going on down there, if things have changed or not, but are you still on \u2013 given the work you've seen there, are you still on track to see some improvement there and maybe you could just clarify is that from a margin or an absolute dollar perspective? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, when we looked at how the year was developing or our expectations for the year in 2016 versus 2015, what we said is we could see a scenario where we would see slight improvement in aggregate on a year-over-year basis depending on how the macro situation developed. I would say our first quarter results are certainly encouraging from that perspective, I mean we improved $150 million on a year-over-year basis in a much worse macro environment. And I have to hedge my input or guidance for the rest of the year because it's really difficult to forecast what's going to happen in Brazil. Down 29% in the first quarter, but the team continues to take action. We've got a strong product lineup, we're getting traction on cost and it's a good start to the year, but let's see how the rest of it plays out. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : All right. So environment worse, but your internal performance better than expected? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: At least through the end of the first quarter, yes. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hi, Pat. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Maybe just starting on some of the technology stuff, Cruise Automation, obviously there's been a lot made about the amount that was spent on that, right. I think it was over $1 billion reported in the press and that was a pretty big premium over the private valuations that were discussed in those same articles. Two questions to that. Number one is what are you exactly getting out of that, that made it such a sought after asset? And then maybe more broadly, I mean what does it tell you about sort of the nature of innovation, right? It seems like part of why it's surprising is a small outfit like that can come up with technology that a large outfit like you guys want. And so what does that say about kind of the nature of partnerships as we look to go on this very aggressive technology path? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. Pat, first off, as everyone knows the transaction hasn't closed and we will provide additional details on the acquisition when the deal closes. We still expect that that will happen in Q2. So when you look at that though, there is a lot of technical capability within General Motors. And when you look at the specific technologies that are necessary, which there are many and there's still, I will say, critical development on the mainline, the expertise and the work that's already been done by Cruise, we saw as something that would really accelerate our ability to lead from an autonomous perspective. And I think from a shareholder perspective, we are always looking at ways that we can lead and get there more quickly and make the decision of do we partner, do we buy or do we develop internally. And as we looked at the capability, we clearly thought, and our vision of the future again of where Cruise was headed, we were very much aligned similar to the way we were with Lyft and we saw this as a huge opportunity to really accelerate our performance in autonomous. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And I guess just building on that, within the technology, autonomous driving, cyber security, V2V, are those things that ultimately you want to really have full control of in-house, or do you see yourselves working with partnerships for the foreseeable future just given how fast all of this is evolving? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think as an OEM and looking at the whole autonomous experience, we want to make sure we control the key areas where we can differentiate the experience for the customer and the entire customer experience. So, but within that there are strong partnerships. We continue to work with Mobileye along with other partnerships. But I think what you need, where we are going to place the emphasis on is controlling the key aspects of the whole value chain. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. If I can sneak one last one just on leasing. I know that you said, Chuck, that leasing was, the residuals were performing well. The Manheim of course has turned a bit. What are your like underlying residual assumptions for your lease book? Are you assuming some kind of decline in residuals, or how is that sort of working into that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes certainly, used car pricing has been at all-time highs over the most recent couple of years and from a planning perspective, we expect moderation in used car pricing. That's built into both the auto company as well as GMF's expectations, and we're seeing that play out kind of as we expected. So, no material exposures, no material risk and as I said, as we anticipated a moderation in used car pricing is built into our baseline plan. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot guys, and congratulations on the quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Pat. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Pat. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Had a couple questions on North America. First, I'm trying to just triangulate how pricing and costs may look going forward and maybe just to kind of level-set me, was there roughly a $400 million year-over-year tailwind from the non-recurrence of that, the rental sales delays from last year and about a maybe $150 million cost benefit from the pension change this quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That's directionally correct, picking out those two specific drivers amongst many, yes. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So I guess it's pretty impressive that you are suggesting that pricing actually improves over the course of the year, even as that factor on a year-over-year basis, I would expect would fade into the back half? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, what's going to help the pricing for the rest of the year, Rod, is obviously new majors, the Malibu, Cruze, XT5, amongst others and that's very consistent with what we guided before that we expected to see a increase in new major pricing over the rest of the year. And the full-year impact of the pricing actions we've taken over the last number of months on full-size SUVs and trucks and kind of cycling through some of the support that we've had to provide on passenger cars as we launch these new cars is going to have a benefit from a carryover pricing standpoint. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So you're saying it's not really just Malibu and Cruze because it looked like to offset that on an annualized basis, you'd need to improve the pricing by like $3,000 on those vehicles. You're suggesting that there's other vehicles that you've been taking price up on. Is that right? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Sure. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then the North American fixed cost number, you showed in your deck $600 million. I'm assuming that that includes the $150 million from the pension, so it was like $750 million in the quarter. Is that a reasonable run rate that we should be thinking about for the rest of this year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: No. And again, when you look at the puts and takes, first quarter this year versus first quarter of last year, clearly we had that fleet loss headwind last year in the first quarter. This year we had the SAP program, which we've talked about very clearly, which was in the range of $240 million, you already brought up the pension. But in addition in the first quarter, we had launch-related costs from both a marketing and a manufacturing perspective in the range of $200 million. We've very clearly talked about an increase in engineering expense in 2016 versus the prior year to support our very aggressive product launch cadence. And that obviously has had an impact in Q1, but as we've talked about in the past, broadly speaking, starting in a company level, Rod, we said that incremental material, logistics performance, savings and manufacturing in GBS would more than offset increased fixed costs associated with D&A, marketing and engineering, as we went through that product launch cadence and that's playing out as we expected from a total company level. In North America, we cycle through and we are talking to you early next February, I would expect that to be relatively flattish, when I think about material cost performance, logistics performance and the net fixed cost increase year-over-year. So, nothing fundamentally has changed. And my last comment would be, take this in the context of, we will and we're still very much on track to generate 10% plus EBIT margins in North America in 2016. And obviously, there will be puts and takes on all the drivers, but I think that's the fundamental message. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And just one last thing, if you can comment on this, it seems like a number of companies, including GM, are performing really well in Europe, better than expected, but there's a bit of caution maybe partly because of the concerns about Brexit. Is that something that is sort of characterizing your outlook that just the uncertainty there is affecting your view and is there \u2013 do you have any thoughts on what the implications of that might be? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, as we sit today, very strong first quarter, significant improvement versus last year, I would say ahead of plan through the first quarter, we're still committed to drive that business to breakeven this year. But versus where we were at three or four months ago, I'd say the biggest kind of cloud or headwind out there is the currency environment and what's driving that is the weaker pound sterling, which obviously isn't being helped by the Brexit situation. And I'd say that's the biggest risk that we have amongst many, but that's the biggest risk that we have right now that we're working to manage through. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, kind of continuing on North America. Looking at your 10-K, it looks like when you talk about variable profit, it shifted even more to trucks. It went from 1.6 times the average to 1.7 times and cars deteriorated from 40% to 30% and even CUBs deteriorated. I guess a few questions around that. One, will the actions in terms of products around Malibu and Cruze, and I assume the Lambda platform help move this over the next year? And then second, with some competitors seeing the profit pools in large SUVs and pickup trucks adding capacity over the next couple of years, how are you thinking about protecting those profits in the years to come? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, we'll certainly, as we go through the launch cadence, not only on passenger cars and new entries in the Cadillac portfolio and refreshing the oldest crossover lineup, we would expect to see that profit dynamic shift and obviously improve those profit pools in passenger cars and crossovers, vis-\u00e0-vis trucks. The other thing that's just mathematically impacting that shift from the 2014 K to the 2015 K is we're selling more vehicles in Mexico and obviously there are more passenger cars there and they're lower priced, lower profit, obviously lower cost, and that's having an impact as well. Relative to trucks, the way you protect your profit pool in trucks and SUVs, great products, great brands, continue to take advantage of that, align supply and demand and continue to drive cost efficiency. And our trucks, well into their lifecycle, continue to perform very well. We had just under 38% retail share in the first quarter. We continue to lead in the industry, we just launched a refreshed truck, which will carry us to the next generation truck, and we feel very confident that we'll be able to protect those pools, because we've got great products. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And just a follow-up on sedans, how \u2013 and we'll see GM Financial later in the day \u2013 are you dealing with the fall in residuals on sedan prices? Is it, A, any noise from the dealers that they need trade-in allowances? I'll ask GM Financial later on how it's showing up in the lease returns. And then as you work with your rental car partners, any shift from risk to program cars on that, or \u2013 and are they beginning to ask for lower-priced cars, or are you leaving that for the competitors? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, as I mentioned earlier, Brian, overall, lease portfolio continues to perform well for GMF, obviously trucks and SUVs are performing very well; cars are performing not as well as they had been, but at a portfolio level, we are okay. We talked about very specifically our strategy to reduce our daily rental fleet sales, and that's really focused on repurchase because at the end of the day, what we're trying to do is, reduce our exposure to the used car market, continue to focus on retail deliveries, which drives better residuals ultimately and better owner loyalty, so that's part of the strategy as well. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. This is Neel Mehta standing in for Adam Jonas. Mary, the company has been making a number of investments, both organic and strategic, in shared, electric and autonomous. These are serious moves that are creating a pretty formidable collection of proprietary high-tech assets and software engineering capability and intellectual property. Is there any argument that can be made to support this collection of tech along with the existing OnStar infrastructure to exist as an independent entity separate from the parent company to perhaps help maximize value to shareholders? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, first, talking about the connectivity. I mean, I really think when you look at putting the customer at the center of what they want, they want that in today's business. So, it's vital to have integrated into the vehicle from a tech perspective to meet and exceed the wants and desires of customers today. From an autonomous perspective, I appreciate your comments, I think we are looking at it very seriously and with the extensive technology capability we have inside the company along with scale and understanding how to do and execute vehicles with this type of technology safely, I think it is something that really it is an opportunity for us and that's why we're moving so quickly on it. But I think right now, when you look at it, it's looking at how the business is going to evolve and we'll look at that over time, but the technologies I see are \u2013 many are very core to selling vehicles today. And even on autonomous, that's a journey, there is an evolutionary path and a revolutionary path and we're working on both. Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Understood. And one follow-up, if I may. What does management think of the idea of creating a brand that is 100% focused on electric propulsion, whether it be an all new brand or say taking Cadillac and focusing on all further development just on EVs? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I touched on this before. But when you look at it, first of all, we have two global brands, Chevrolet and Cadillac, and there is also pure EV like we have with the Bolt EV that will be coming out later this year, we have extended range electric vehicles with the Chevrolet Volt. But then we also have a lot of electrification, the Malibu Hybrid and we'll be launching over 10 new electrified vehicles in China. So to us really the electrification is something that we integrated in the portfolio that allows us to build not only our capability and spread it broadly and reach more customers, but also to build those brands so they're viewed appropriately as technology leaders. And I think we continue to do that, so we see it as core and integrated. Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh great, thanks for taking my question. Just first question on the free cash flow. If you look at working capital and accrued and other liabilities, it looked like it was a $2 billion outflow in the quarter versus just $900 million last year for those two items. Is there anything unusual and should that be a nice reversal into Q2? And then could you just remind us on the pension funding, once you do the $2 billion, you are done for the year, so this is essentially just swapping pension for debt? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Again going back to the comment I made earlier, I think look at working capital separately, which was a $400 million impact versus $600 million in the first quarter of 2015. When you look at accrued and other liabilities, that's the other line that is impacted by reduced customer deposits associated with daily rentals, so as we sell less daily rentals, we get less customer deposits. As we de-fleet, it has an impact on operating leases, so you got to kind of look at those two lines together and net-net, it was a $1.1 billion impact in the first quarter of this year versus $1.5 billion last year, which is a $400 million improvement broadly speaking. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And the pension funding though, once you do the $500 million, it's done for the year. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, we borrowed $2 billion. We will have contributed $2 billion. We're done, I mean obviously that was as we talked about it, a risk management approach to push out some of the timing on the liabilities into a 20- and 30-year timeframe and push out mandatory contributions from maybe 2019 and 2020 to the early 2020s, 2022, 2023. We would expect as interest rates increase, when they increase that that will help close the remaining gap at least from a U.S. perspective going forward. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. From the credit side, you talked earlier, it sounds like you don't see a big impact from used car prices on your lease portfolio. Any color on subprime risk in terms of how much of GM Financial is subprime, and how are those loans performing? A lot of concerning headlines about subprime default. I mean is the performance within your portfolio pretty consistent though? Because I think there's probably an industry mix issue out there. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well one, our subprime portfolio originations have been relatively constant over the last number of years, so we're not growing that, that's first. Two, AmeriCredit, now GMF, subject matter experts in subprime and managing the risk associated with subprime. Third, our delinquencies and credit losses associated with subprime have been very stable over the last number of years. We see no incremental risk associated with that. And then finally, we're running today originations as we execute our captive strategy, 80% of originations are prime, near prime. So, again very stable levels of subprime activity at GMF. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Very helpful. And just one last strategic question. Some of your competitors are talking about battery pack cost of $190 per kilowatt hour for both the cell and the pack. Can you match that kind of cost today and does that sound reasonable where the technology is today from your perspective? Any thoughts there on the EV costs and the competition. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah, we've talked about with the Bolt EV and with the strategic work that we do with LG and with some other key suppliers, so we think we're on a path with the Bolt as we launch and get to scale of being in an industry-leading position of $150 and then continuing to improve that down. So, we work very closely on that. We think it's key, and not that we talk about it specifically with numbers, but we've seen dramatic improvement from the first generation of the Volt to the second generation of the Volt that is carried into the Bolt EV and we'll continue to drive that down. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And the $150 though, is that for the cell, or is that all in cell and pack? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I believe it's all-in, but I think when you say all-in, there everybody may have a slightly different definition of what they mean when they say all-in depending on how they have architected the vehicle. We can provide more detail on that, but again I think there's some variation in how people are defining that. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the great quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Ryan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, so first question is just on China. Your margin there has been remarkably stable, right, relative to I think investor expectations. It would fall given the softer pricing environment. So can you talk about how you've been able to keep that margin steady despite what looks like kind of 6% type declines versus maybe more normal 3% type price declines, whether that's due to mix, volume, cost, something else given that you don't provide a China-specific walk. And then what are the drivers going to be going forward for the rest of the year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, nothing has changed vis-\u00e0-vis the China fundamentals versus what we've been talking about for the last year or so. Fundamentally price continues to be a challenge. Last year it was in the range of 4% to 5% negative price headwinds. On carryover, we expect that same level this year. That's what we've seen play out so far in the first quarter. And we're offsetting that impact through improved, significantly improved mix and you saw some of those results. The Envision as an SUV, sales up significantly; the Baojun, 560, we're launching critical new products like the Cadillac CT6 and Cadillac XT5. So mix has been a mitigant to the price headwinds, as well as carryover material performance and kind of when I look at those two together, they kind of offset the price headwinds and where you see the benefit, at least on an aggregate equity income or profit perspective is volume. And we would expect to see that play out. Obviously, we continue to focus very much on cost efficiency, both material logistics and fixed cost, but broadly speaking favorable volume, favorable mix as we improve our Cadillac portfolio and launch more crossovers and MPVs. Favorable material performance offsetting or more than offsetting price headwinds as well as fixed cost increases, we bring up new plants. That's the broad strokes, Ryan. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. And the last one is just a quick question on auto finance given that you've already commented on used car prices and subprime penetration. Maybe just round that out, could you talk about what you see as the sustainability of some other trends that have been supportive of SAAR like loan duration and lease penetration? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, we expect for us \u2013 specifically, we had pretty strong lease penetration in the first quarter, driven by again some of the model wind-down efforts around Malibu, Cruze and the SRX. We would expect to see that moderate, we'll be somewhat below industry average because trucks don't lease at the same levels and obviously we're overweight in trucks. So, we would expect to see that kind of continue. We're taking a number of actions to make sure we optimize residuals, we talked about the Express Drive, rental hubs, anything that you can do \u2013 the factory pre-owned collection, anything you can do to take that supply out of the auction and generally will help residuals over time and clearly that's a focus that we have going forward. Ryan J. Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. Congrats again. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, thank you very much and thanks everybody for joining the call this morning. I have to say I'm extremely proud of the team from what they were able to accomplish this year, but we know we have more opportunity as we go through the year. We're going to continue with the discipline and detailed focus on strengthening the core business and the adjacencies, but also taking advantage of growth opportunities and our ability to lead as personal mobility is transformed and redefined. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Thursday, July 21, 2016. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have included the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. And then we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer, to assist in answering your questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I am extremely pleased to report that GM delivered strong earnings in the quarter that included record EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins in North America, record sales and strong margins in China, profitability in Europe, and records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, earnings per share diluted-adjusted and return on invested capital. Let's take a look at the numbers. Net income increased over 150% to $2.9 billion as revenue rose 11% to $42.4 billion. EBIT-adjusted was up 37% to $3.9 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.3%, up from 7.5%. Earnings per share diluted-adjusted was $1.86, up from $1.29. Automotive adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion, and we had a record ROIC of 30.5% on a trailing four-quarter basis, and this continues to demonstrate the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. Given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second part of the year, we now expect 2016 full year EBIT-adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6.00 per diluted adjusted share, up from the $5.25 to $5.75 range we announced in January. As I mentioned, our strong quarter was underpinned by outstanding performances in North America, China and Europe, so let me just touch on those briefly. In North America we gained 0.4 percentage points of retail share in the U.S. in the first half of the year. This is the highest of any full line manufacturer and I think it really indicates that our focus on more profitable sales is working. We had the best Q2 light truck retail sales in nine years and the best mid-size retail pickup sales in 11 years. Average transaction prices on full-size pickups are up $2,700 per unit to date versus the Q2 2015 performance, and our ATPs across all models and brands are up about $1,500 per unit. Expected continued momentum in H2 will be driven by the launches of the Cruze, the Bolt EV, the LaCrosse and the Acadia. And we will also have improved availability of pickups and crossovers. As we look at China, we are on track to sustain our strong margins this year. Our H1 sales are up 5.3% year-over-year to a record 1.8 million units, and this is really due to a really great mix of MPVs and SUVs, and also luxury vehicles that customers are signaling that they really like. Brands continue to grow. Buick and Baojun set quarterly records, with Buick up 40% and Baojun up 78% year-over-year. And our Cadillac sales are up 16% year-to-date. The GM SUV deliveries almost doubled in the quarter, and this continues to be led by two really strong products : the Baojun 560 and the Buick Envision. In Europe, the team posted its first profitable quarter since the second quarter of 2011. It was a great team effort across every single aspect of the business. Opel and Vauxhall outperformed the industry with a 7% year-over-year sales increase to 621,000 vehicles in the first half of this year. And we have more products coming in the second half with the new Zafira and the refreshed Mokka X. In addition to the top line growth we've reviewed so far, we are also on track to exceed our target $5.5 billion in cost efficiencies by 2018 when we look at it compared to the 2014 baseline. This will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering, and the technology investments we're making as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. In fact, this year alone, we expect approximately $2 billion in cost performance from non-raw materials and logistics. So again, I think you can look at it and see extremely strong performance across the entire business. We are also \u2013 as we do strong performance and continue to work to improve the core operations, we are moving very quickly to leverage our technical expertise and to lead and define the future of personal mobility with a customer focus. On the autonomous front, we completed our acquisition of Cruise Automation, and we began testing self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads with safety drivers. And this started in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cruise provides the unique software capabilities, and when you take that software technology combined with our own expertise, it is really accelerating our work in fully autonomous driving. We've also rapidly grown our shared mobility services. Maven city and residential car sharing has grown to now to five markets, including New York, Ann Arbor, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C., and GM and Lyft Express Drive on-demand car sharing has expanded from Chicago to Boston, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. And Express Drive members have driven more than 2 million miles on the platform in just four months. And they are getting to experience the quality, safety and technology that our products and our brands have to offer. Later this year we'll install Express Drive fleets in Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Our demonstrated commitment to innovation and our autonomous work are really changing perceptions about General Motors and helping us, and specifically our Cruise Automation operations, recruit the kind of talented men and women from the tech sector that we need to really increase and drive our innovation and performance. So in summary, we had an outstanding quarter, and I am extremely proud of the team. And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. I just want to take a few minutes to provide some perspective on the quarter and the first half. In addition to the outstanding second quarter that we just posted, we also had a very strong first half for the company. EBIT-adjusted results for the first half grew to $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3% in the first half, up 160 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad based, with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first half of the year. To demonstrate the strength of our business over time, we have now delivered EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion and nearly 8% margins over the last four quarters. Our strong first half results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China, and a return to profitability in Europe. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to $5.9 billion for the first half, up $1 billion year-over-year. North American EBIT-adjusted margins continue to be strong at 10.5%, up 80 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the 2016 calendar year. As an additional proof point that demonstrates the sustainability and strength of our business, North America has achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for four of the last five quarters, and over the last four quarters has delivered $12 billion in EBIT-adjusted with 10.7% margins. And fundamentally supporting our business is the U.S. light vehicle industry that is tracking in the low-to-mid 17 million SAAR range year-to-date, up 1.2% compared to the same period last year. We continue to believe the industry will remain strong. As for the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1 billion for the first half, about equal to a year ago, and net income margins were 9.6%. However, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions in South America and many parts of our international operations continue to be challenging. The team continues to work to offset these pressures, and we will continue to take the necessary steps to set up these regions for future success. A proof point is South America. In the first half of 2016, we narrowed losses by $170 million, despite a much more challenging economic environment fundamentally in Brazil. Moving on to Europe. The region achieved its second straight quarter of break-even or better results. In fact, not only was the second quarter profitable, but the region recorded EBIT adjusted of $131 million for the first half, up over $400 million on a year-over-year basis. Of course, one of the largest uncertainties we have in Europe is the impact of the referendum in the UK. And let me provide some commentary on Brexit. Clearly, things are still fluid, and there are a lot of unknowns. It is important that negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU are concluded in a timely manner, and all businesses will certainly benefit from free movement of goods and people, and continued free movement of goods and people. Certainly we've made substantial progress towards our target to break even by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization, and recent launches like the Astra and Corsa. Prior to the result of the referendum, we were on track to break even for the year, as evidenced by our positive first-half performance. The result of the vote has adversely impacted the British pound, and the uncertainty has put a strain on the UK automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an impact of up to $400 million to the second half of 2016. However, it's important to note that the team remains focused on making progress on our turn-around plan in Europe. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.2 billion for the second quarter and $1.7 billion for the first half, both about equal to a year ago. Important to note that capital spending was $1.1 billion higher in the first half of this year versus 2015 as we make investments in our portfolio in line with our previously communicated plan. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is expected to more than double in the second half of the year, and we remain very much on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. We also remain focused on investing in the business and increasing shareholder value for the long term. As Mary discussed earlier, our strategic investments in Lyft and Cruise Automation help us to build the foundation to lead and define the future of personal mobility for our customers. We're pleased to report that we closed on the acquisition of Cruise Automation during the second quarter. The deal consideration at closing was approximately $600 million, with $300 million paid in cash during the quarter and the remaining $300 million paid through the issuance of new common stock. Additionally, we entered into other agreements associated with retention of key employees and performance-based awards contingent on continued employment and/or reaching certain milestones from a technology and a commercialization perspective. Despite nearly $800 million in cash outflows associated with our investments in Lyft and Cruise in the first half, as well as higher CapEx, our automotive cash balance increased $1.6 billion to $20.1 billion, bringing our balance back in line with our target. Turning to our capital allocation framework, we continue to focus on driving shareholder value in the short and long term. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the first half, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $300 million in share repurchases. Please note, because of the seasonally challenging cash flow in the first quarter and our desire to get back up to our target cash level of $20 billion by the end of the second quarter, we expected that our stock buyback program would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Because we are in a seasonal cash flow business, I would focus less on smaller levels of stock buybacks in a quarter and more on the overall plan. We will deliver on our commitment to buy back $5 billion of stock by the end of 2016. In fact, we intend to complete the $5 billion stock buyback commitment within or ahead of the original timeline. Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016, as Mary indicated earlier, given our very strong first half performance and our current outlook for the second half of the year, we now expect 2016 full year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be in the range of $5.50 to $6.00 per diluted adjusted share. We expect the second half of the year to be strong but slightly below H1 results, primarily due to uncertainties associated with Brexit. As we've shown, we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we are in great position for improved full-year profit and margin growth versus 2015, which would be another record year for the company. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Congratulations. Had a couple questions. First, on North America, clearly some very strong pricing positives this quarter. Just wondering if you can comment on how we should be thinking about that for the rest of the year, and specifically what's the thinking behind the more aggressive posture on pickup incentives. And then on Europe, presumably you've got some hedges that are offsetting the pound impact this year. So how should we be thinking about the kind of carry-over effect as some of those hedges begin to roll off? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Thanks, Rod. Starting with North America. Second quarter, strong pricing on both new launches as we expected and guided earlier in the year, as well as carry-over pricing and we took advantage of continued strength in trucks and SUVs. I would expect to see overall pricing moderate on a run-rate basis in the second half of the year. We'll continue to have strong pricing on our new product launches, but carry-over pricing on a half-to-half basis will be a typical headwind. I would talk about that in the context of we still expect very strong performance in North America in the second half and are still driving to 10%-plus margins. But that's kind of the big picture on that Relative to truck incentives and the incentive programs in early July, I want to just make sure, that is absolutely not a shift in our focus and discipline around incentives. That was nothing more than a tactic to kick off the model year 2016 sell-down as we get ready to launch both the model year 2017 trucks and SUVs as well as new products. So that's more of a tactic versus anything else. And again, you have to look at that in the context of our expectations for the second half of the year. On Europe relative to hedges, we did have some hedges in place that we put in place earlier this year that would cover some of the pound sterling exposure. The guidance that I provided on the second half of the year, kind of the up to $400 million headwind, reflects our \u2013 if the current economic conditions were to be sustained for the rest of the year. And the biggest driver of that is really the weakness of the pound sterling. That reflects any impact of the hedge roll-off as anything else. So that's an all-in number right now. Again, assuming that the current conditions persist through the rest of the year. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is there any carryover effect as we think about the hedges rolling off into next year? Does the impact worsen? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, look. It is early days, and very uncertain. The way I think about it is, in the second half of the year, again, with no mitigating actions or anything else, the biggest impact is the pound sterling. That could be up to $400 million. It's roughly in the $1.30, $1.31, $1.32 range. You pick the day. I think, all other things being equal, multiplying that by two would be kind of a calendar year impact just looking at that specific driver. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just lastly on mobility. How should we be thinking about GM's position regarding any future investment in Lyft at this point? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So Rod, I'm not going to \u2013 there's been a lot of speculation. I'm not going to continue to speculate. But what I would say is that with the Lyft alliance, it is accomplishing everything we set out for it to do. In fact, it's exceeding our expectations. When you look at Express Drive, and I talked about how we're expanding the launch, that's something that is obviously positive from a Lyft perspective, but very positive for us because it gives us an opportunity to take vehicles coming off lease or coming off rental and put them into this, which is a better place to put the vehicles and also allows us to grow our residuals. Also, we are very committed to being among the leaders or leading in autonomous technology. Clearly the Cruise Automation was a big piece of that, and the fact that we've already got cars on the road I think speaks to that. And we do believe that autonomous will first be tested out in the marketplace in a sharing type environment, and the alliance provides us the opportunity to do that. So the alliance is delivering what we need it to. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good morning, Itay. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So maybe just one financial and one strategic question. First, Chuck, just on the financial side, back to the $400 million Brexit impact. Can you just talk to what you're assuming for the UK and overall European auto market in the second half of the year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would say, again, very early days. But if I was sizing up the $400 million, I would say it's primarily the pound sterling. The UK market, our initial assessments for the second half, it could be up to 5% to 10% reduction. But it's very, very early days. And I would say our perspective, again, is the largest majority of that potential impact is pound sterling-related. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, then just a quick one on North America. What is the net impact from the auction sales in the quarter? It looks like it probably helped your volume delta on slide 14, but hurt the mix. Do you have a rough number of what the net of those two are? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I mean, obviously, one of the reasons that we're executing to the retail-focused strategy is retail vehicles are more profitable than daily rent, and there's all kinds of long-term benefits, so \u2013 which would imply daily rental are not very profitable. And as I looked across the whole EBIT bridge, I'd say it's close to a push, Itay. The favorable volume is offset by unfavorable mix and some unfavorable costs that winds its way through just the variable manufacturing associated with that. So, close to a push. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Then, maybe one strategic question for Mary. As you roll out the autonomous Bolt EVs in San Francisco for the testing, can you give us sort of an early sense on what the game plan is in terms of deployment of your shared level for vehicles in the Lyft network? Initially with the driver, maybe the size and the timing and magnitude of this initiative? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah. We haven't announced the exact timing because we're going to make sure as we develop the technology, we're being gated by making sure that we have safe autonomous technology to put into the marketplace. We expect when we do that and we're working aggressively \u2013 I mean, I think the fact that we have the vehicles and we're able to so quickly integrate the Cruise Automation software into the vehicles I think speaks to the speed at which we're moving. But we do believe it'll be in a shared environment. There will be a safety driver in the vehicle as we demonstrate with miles earned and also customer acceptance. But we haven't put specific timing or quantity on that, more to follow on that as we continue to develop the technology. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thanks so much, everyone. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Itay. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Itay. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Just a first question on slide 14 on North America. I mean, as we look at the daily rental pressure easing in the second half of the year, is that the kind of thing that could actually become a little bit of a tailwind on a year-over-year basis as we get into early next year? And also in the context of these vehicles that you guys will hang on to on the leasing side, I just wondered if you could talk about lease penetration in the quarter, where you can see that going and how you might deal with a much higher level of lease return in the coming years? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Again, I would look at all of these in the context of we're driving this business for sustainable 10%-plus margins. We expect the second half to be strong like the first half was from a North American perspective. Clearly, one of the benefits of the cycling through the daily rental is some of the challenges that we had on daily rental auction losses. So I think that ultimately there is a number of moving pieces in the second half but certainly we would expect to see strong performance. Lease penetration thus far in the first half of the year for us has run in the 28% range or so, a little bit above historical levels. We would expect to see that moderate over time. And one of the reasons that we're so focused on building Express Drive, reducing daily rental and everything else is because we know that lease returns are going to increase, the used car market is going to normalize, and we're taking proactive actions to improve our residuals, improved our used car values for that timeframe. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's very helpful. And then a second question on the buybacks. We have the $5 billion commitment by the end of 2016. I'm just curious if you could just remind us where you are to date on those buybacks? And as we think about the potential to do more with the incremental $4 billion authorization, what sort of is the timeframe we should think about for the incremental $4 billion on top of the $5 billion? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. So we've purchased, to date, $3.8 billion. As I just noted, we are committed to completing the initial share buyback of $5 billion per the committed timeline, which was the end of 2016. We will do that as quickly as possible here in 2016. The increased authorization was through the end of 2017. Again, our capital allocation framework, relatively transparent to the extent that we are appropriately investing in the business and we maintain our $20 billion target cash and our strong balance sheet, available free cash flow will come back to shareholders. So, that will be the gating on how quickly we execute the second $4 billion. I'd also point out, and I tried to make note of that in my comments, we are dealing with seasonality from a cash flow perspective, so we always need to think that share buybacks will generally be weighted towards the second half of the year versus the first half, just because of the low seasonality in the first quarter. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Incredibly helpful. And then just lastly, Mary, GM has got a long track record of coming up with great technology way ahead of what is generally perceived in the market, but then, the commercialization and monetization of that technology doesn't always really come through. OnStar is a great example of a product that is now gaining steam, but it's been around for a long time. As you're working on all these new projects, I'm just wondering how you think about ultimately, really commercializing and monetizing above and beyond what you're doing right now. I mean, it seems like you're way ahead of the curve on sort of the testing phase, but just curious how you think about commercializing and monetizing these efforts going forward. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think you can look across a couple of technologies. First, we continue on the journey with electrification, and I think launching the Chevrolet Bolt EV later this year, getting that into the marketplace, seeing the customer reception, when you really start to erase range anxiety with a 200-mile drive \u2013 200-mile capability and with, we believe, the industry's lowest cell cost. So that's something we're putting into the marketplace, capitalize on the fact that we think we have, in partnership with LG, demonstrated the cell technology \u2013 which, by the way, we own the IP for our cell chemistry \u2013 putting that into the marketplace. We're going to look to see how quickly that expands from an electrification perspective. From an OnStar, agree, I think we've in the last couple years really accelerated, have a true leadership when we look at having OnStar with that connectivity across four continents. And we're continuing to look at ways to monetize that and that's something that's accelerating. And then with autonomous, to your point, that's one of the reasons we did the Lyft alliance is we recognized early that the fastest way to get the technology into customers' hands, and to really learn and be driven by what customer expectations are is to get it into a ride-sharing fleet and get it out there. So I think we're demonstrating different behavior with how we're getting the technology and the innovation and the technological advancements we've done into the marketplace more quickly. And I will also tell you, that's something I focus on every day. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. A couple of questions, somewhat related. First, it was kind of a soft SAAR last month. DSRs have been down on a year-over-year basis three months in a row. How are you seeing sort of the sales outlook just in terms of U.S. SAAR for the remainder of this year and then flowing into 2017? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. We have maintained our view that the U.S. industry is going to remain strong, in the mid 17 million kind of range through the rest of this year and kind of into next year. When we look at the leading indicators from an economic perspective and those indicators that really drive the auto SAAR, they continue to remain strong and favorable. And again, we would expect to see this improve in the second half and then continue to be strong in 2017. That's our baseline assumption, Brian. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And secondly, thinking ahead to a potential eventual downturn, what is your commitment to the dividend that you're paying now? You didn't buy back stock in part, we understand, because you wanted to maintain a $20 billion cash balance, but in a downturn, that might go down. Just how committed are you to the dividend through a downturn? Or would you seek to maybe limit the dividend and focus more on share buybacks? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I think that's a hypothetical question, Brian, because it depends on the downturn, the depth of the downturn, the perspective on the view of the downturn. Clearly, as we think about a moderate downturn and we think about our cash balance and everything else, what we would like to be able to do in a typical moderate downturn, maintain investment and maintain the dividend without drawing on the revolver. All right? If those are the facts and circumstances at that point, I think that would be a guiding behavior or a guiding tenet that you can think about. But it really depends on the facts and circumstances of the downturn. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And kind of moderate, are you thinking sort of minus 10%? Minus 20%? Minus Great Recession numbers? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, Great Recession isn't moderate. So I would say, if you look historically and from a U.S. perspective, a moderate downturn is 20% to 25%. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But so you would be willing to have cash go below $20 billion and use the balance sheet cash? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That's why we have it. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, that's why we carry it. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And I guess it gets to when I think of your slide on investment case, and maybe this is a question more for Mary, should investors be looking at you more as an earnings growth play, or more as a dividend yield investment? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah, I really think it's both. I mean, I think when you look at our core business that we continue to invest in, the fundamentals of having great cars, trucks, and crossovers that customers are signaling they want to buy, we're segment leading, winning a lot of awards, continuing to look at how do we capitalize on adjacency, on connectivity, on GM Financial, so strengthening the core businesses, and growing with using adjacencies and also in some other key markets. And then on top of that, being very selective in those estimates we're making, so we can take and build on the expertise that's fundamental in this company of integrating technology into vehicles and putting them out on the roads, that potentially have the opportunity to dramatically change \u2013 I'll say, the current business from an earnings perspective of what that new business is worth. So we are working on both. I would be very happy if people thought of us as delivering and doing both. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. This is Neel Mehta standing in for Adam Jonas. Just two questions for you. First, taking a look at the broader industry, it seems like GM has been fairly disciplined with respect to capacity additions in North America. Wanted to get your assessment on the overall industry's discipline. Is there any concern out there that we could see pricing headwinds down the road if there's too much capacity in the industry, even if SAAR remains relatively healthy and stable? And then the second question is, there's a growing concern out there regarding off-lease supply, particularly as we head into the 2018 timeframe. Can you talk about GM's potential remarketing strategy around these vehicles? And could your Express Drive or Maven programs be disposition channels for off-lease vehicles in the future? Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Relative to industry capacity, pricing, and everything else, as you look over the last number of years and just track incentive spend as a percent of transaction prices, it's inched up a little bit as we look at the trend over the last number of years. Nothing alarming. It appears that, from our perspective, the industry has continued to be rational from that perspective. Our base case is that's going to continue. As a matter of fact, one of your colleagues just wrote a research report that would indicate that the OEMs are displaying a lot of incentive discipline, and that could ultimately have a bit of a headwind from an overall SAAR perspective going forward. So we still continue to see that. Obviously, there's puts and takes. There's always puts and takes, strong pricing in trucks, SUVs, crossovers, weakness in passenger cars, but by and large, we continue to see overall discipline. We're certainly going to remain disciplined. We're certainly going to continue to focus on capacity utilization. Hence, our focus on profitable retail growth versus fleet. Relative to off-lease supply, I think I answered that question, indirectly or directly, earlier. We are focusing on reducing our daily rental just to make sure that we are not adding to the used vehicle market, because that has a tendency to impact residuals, which then impacts off-lease vehicles. We have our Express Drive program, which specifically will use vehicles that are coming from rental and/or off lease, as the supply for Lyft drivers. And we think that's going to have a pretty significant take up. We have our factory pre-owned collection as well, where we're trying to go directly to customers instead of through the auction, and make available a used car fleet from General Motors Company cars, daily rental, et cetera. All of those are really to make sure that there's good supply/demand balance looking forward. And early days, but generally on track. Neel N. Mehta - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize if I missed this, but any color on the purchase price for Cruise Automation? And any color on what you \u2013 the factors considering in making that kind of acquisition, since it's really more of a technology today? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, from a technology perspective, as we look at autonomous, Cruise Automation is the company that we have been following for a couple of years now. And as we saw the progress, and a very specific technology from a \u2013 call it machine learning or artificial intelligence, that coupled with all the work we were doing, we felt it accelerated our ability to be first or among the leaders as we implement fully autonomous technology into vehicles. And so it was very specific. It was something we'd been watching for quite a period of time. And strategically, we thought it was appropriate and we did a complete make/buy analysis but we thought the work that we had observing would integrate very well and accelerate our efforts. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And how much was the final price? I saw some different varying headlines on it? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: $581 million at deal. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then just a follow-up, not to belabor the UK $400 million cost; that was a little bit higher than I was expecting. Are you including in there any offset from the fact that you have facilities in the UK that now have, at least in the near term, a cost tailwind as you sell into Continental Europe? Or any possible pricing offset as a lot of people in the industry will be facing challenges as you import into UK? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: We have certainly factored in our footprint and manufacturing footprint. The fact is we import a heck of a lot more units into the UK than we export \u2013 manufacture and export out, so we're long pound sterling. There is very little pricing mitigation assumed in that $400 million for the balance of the year specifically because, number one, it's early days. Number two, before you can take pricing action, you have to sell through inventory and the overall inventory levels in the UK are reasonably high across all of the OEMs. And that will certainly be one of the items as we work through this and see how it develops that we will be looking at it, as I'm sure other competitors will as well, as well as cost and other mitigating actions. So primarily, as I said earlier, the $400 million, looking at our overall position, primarily weakness in the pound sterling and some industry headwind. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And lastly, when I'm looking at slide 14 with the North America walk, any color \u2013 you kind of highlight in the comments that mix is mostly the rental impact. I thought with SUVs being so strong, that mix would be positive. Did that more than offset that impact? And any color on the fixed cost and other, the $800 million, is that a run rate we should consider going forward or is this something unusual in the quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I'd say first off, mix for trucks and SUVs, this is a period-to-period adjustment and we've been in a pretty strong mix condition for the last year and a half, two years from a truck and SUV perspective. So the year-over-year comp is relatively flat from a mix standpoint. So, I would look at this mix number as being primarily related to the daily rental volume that rolled through volume. Fixed costs, that is very consistent with what we talked about. Incremental D&A because of our launch cadence and new investments, product launches, incremental launch costs from a marketing standpoint as we launch new products, incremental engineering, again in support of our very aggressive launch cadence. And in the second quarter we had pretty significant manufacturing launch-related costs and manufacturing costs associated with the earthquake as we were running a lot of weekends and everything else to try to make up some of that volume. So I would not take this $800 million and multiply it by four from a run rate perspective. I would expect to see fixed cost on kind of a year over year basis improve in the second half of the year versus the first half, year over year. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. On China, I know the margin is still strong, down year-over-year. And I think you called out significant pricing pressure. And it also seemed like the Baojun brand really stepped out, so that probably didn't help mix. I was wondering if you could just talk about if there's any change to the outlook there for the year. I think originally you said 2016 would be fairly flat with 2015. And then again, plans to make those margins sustainable beyond this year. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, we have not changed our outlook for China. We continue to expect strong performance in China, equity income in the range of $2 billion consistent with last year, margins in the 9% to 10% range. Going forward, as we've talked about since early last year, the market is more volatile, the competition is obviously from a price perspective stepping up. We continue to believe that we can execute our plan including our product launches, improve mix from an SUV perspective, continuing efficiencies to maintain strong margins and strong equity income going forward. And we'll have more to say about 2017 early next year. I would say from where we're sitting today, we would expect to deliver the performance that we talked about earlier this year in China. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then, Chuck, I think you mentioned some European cost savings to be put in place to offset some of the changes from Brexit. Can you provide little bit more color there? Does that involve sort of changing the footprint? Is it sort of straight tightening the belt, or what do you have in mind? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, first \u2013 again, I'll go back to the initial comments I made. This is early days, there Is a lot of uncertainty. We wanted to size up again based on the current economic conditions, what the impact would be for the rest of this year. And, you know that I think, based on today's assumptions, is not a bad planning assumption. We will look across the business, as we've demonstrated that we would do not only in Europe but in other parts of the world, to ensure that we are taking the actions that are necessary to drive these businesses to the kind of performance that we need to generate. The whole laundry list. We will look to optimize channel mix in the UK. We will look to pricing, and to the extent possible, price to offset any lingering FX exposure. We will look to optimize our overall cost structure, whether it's in the UK or Europe, to mitigate these things. And that may or may not involve footprint and others actions it will take. We'll look to optimize our material cost. I mean, we will go through the whole list of drivers. And the team has been doing that for the last three of four years, and we'll continue to do that. And this is another speed bump along the way, but we're just going to have to deal with it. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then last one, sticking with Europe. I think you mentioned UK, again early stage, but could be down 5%, 10%. But based on your comment just now about the inventory levels there and how it's going to take a while for a price increase, is it possible or even likely that demand maybe gets a little bit better before it tails off? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I guess I'm not quite sure on your question. You mean demand... Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Well, if consumers wanted to get ahead \u2013 if consumers wanted to get ahead of a price increase? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Who knows, right? I mean, I think they're probably still digesting a lot of what's going on as well. The indications I'm seeing and reading, housing market has already kind of stalled a little bit over there. Consumers are sitting on their wallets. It's just very early days, and something that we're going to have to monitor very closely. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Congrats again, guys. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. This is Samik on behalf of Ryan Brinkman. I have two questions. The first one is on China. You had, I mean, pretty strong margins there. But what we are also seeing is the regulators push that market towards investing and launching new energy vehicles. So I just wanted to check with you how you're positioning your product portfolio for these incentives that are available on new energy vehicles going on a continuing basis. And also if you have any view on the extension of incentives on smaller engine vehicles in China in 2017. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, from a new energy vehicle perspective, we already have vehicles into the marketplace. And we have a launch cadence that we plan on putting out that will continue to expand on that. Again, leveraging the technology that we have, the low cell cost. So I think you'll see us looking and having a comprehensive portfolio from an electrification perspective, taking advantage of the incentives and the opportunity there, but also very important to meet the regulatory environment. So that is work that's well underway. And then, as it relates to the... Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Look, the announced program is through the end of 2016. Clearly, we're staying engaged to the extent possible to get intelligence on whether that would be extended into 2017 or potentially terminated early. I think there's a lot of uncertainty around that point in time. So again, we have not changed our view that it's going to come off December 31. But that's something that we closely monitor. And if there's something meaningful to report at that point in time, we will. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, and the second question I had is there are some early signs here emerging over the last couple of days that the midterm review for the CAFE standards, you might get some relaxation there as well with authorities, sort of acknowledging that the 2025 targets are difficult to achieve with the current mix of vehicles that are being sold. Any updated thoughts there, any discussions, and is that likely to be a tailwind compared to your expectations? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: We continue to work with the government and provide input from \u2013 as we do this mid-term review, which I think was a very important step when the program was put in place with the new targets to have this mid-term review. We clearly have identified a portfolio where we can meet. But a lot \u2013 what everyone has to remember is that it also depends on what customers actually buy. And when you look at the current environment, that drives it as well. So I think we're going to have a good discussion as we do this interim review. But I want to reiterate, we have done a lot of work to have the right portfolio. But I think we also have to make sure that the targets comprehend that customers ultimately choose what vehicles they're going to buy. Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge Research. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congratulations again. Wanted to ask on South America, if I may. Just an update on the endgame there. It looks like you've done a great job with respect to cost controls. Seems like there's some cushion there. You've narrowed losses over time. But it also seems, at the same time, that you're transforming into this business of new technologies and potentially some new monetization channels. So wanted to understand the prioritization of GMSA as it relates to maybe the next medium-term five-year period or so. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, over history, South America has been a very important business for us and has delivered strong performance. We have a very strong product portfolio there and with a lot of model year refreshes that happened this year that are very, I'll say, economically done from a capital deployment perspective. We have a very strong distribution network. I think the strongest dealer body. When you look across the globe, the Chevrolet brand is incredibly strong. So we have a very strong core business franchise in South America and I think the team has done a very good job over the last couple years of really looking at the market conditions, taking cost out, again on all drivers. It gets to the point that Chuck made when we were talking about Europe. We've run that play. We've demonstrated success in South America of really looking at how to take cost out and how to drive an increase from a revenue perspective. So we see that business as important. Obviously, disappointing right now with the macroeconomic conditions that no one knows for sure how long they last, but they're lingering. But we're well positioned and have seen improvement in the first half of this year from the first half of last year even in a more difficult macroeconomic environment. So, very important business for us and we know that it has huge potential as we move forward. As it relates to technologies, whether it's connectivity we've already deployed and we'll continue to grow that over the next couple of years. We'll continue to also see what the receptivity is from an electrification perspective, and from an autonomous perspective. But it will be customer-driven. Clearly, we have the technology and the capability to do it. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great. I appreciate that color. Just two quick housekeeping items, if I may, as a follow-up. First, do you have any plans similar to your peer, key peer in Ford, to break out your digital strategy or technology strategy as a separate segment? And then secondly, as we're thinking about fixed versus variable cost assumptions, I think Chuck alluded to this earlier, but if we're doing a break-even analysis for the next few years in your U.S. business, what are the right percentages to bake in now considering all the improvements you've engineered over time? Thanks so much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, relative to segment reporting, we have no plans at this time to change our segment reporting. Obviously, that's something that we continuously evaluate as the characteristics of the business changes. So the quick answer is, no, on any change to segment reporting at this time. I'm not going to give you our fixed variable perspective on a go-forward basis. I would say from \u2013 our real focus is to continue to maintain break-even point in the U.S. at a 10 million to 11 million SAAR, and that is driven by variable profit improvement and the overall level of fixed cost. I would say, importantly, when you look at cost, look at North America in either the second quarter or the first half of the year, factor in what we categorize as fixed cost versus the material performance, the commercial performance, cost performance is relatively flat. And we grew our margins, which means that variable margins improved as well. And that is supportive of maintaining a low break-even point. So, I kind of think about cost overall, both variable costs, especially the performance aspects of that, the commercial performance against fixed cost increases. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Well, thank you so much and best of luck in the coming quarters. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our last question for today will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hi. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Hey. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : So just a point of clarification first on, I guess, your implied guidance for the second half when you sort of \u2013 essentially guiding to a little bit of a softer earnings in the second half? Is that entirely the risk from Brexit which you quantified? Or is there anything else that you're looking at, and in particular is there anything in North America sequentially? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, okay. First, we're going to \u2013 our expectations are we're going to have a very strong year. We had a very strong first half, and when I look at second half versus first half, the fundamental driver is seasonality, which is largely, even pre-Brexit, was a European issue. We were shut down in Europe, to a large extent, in the third quarter, and then there's the holidays and Brexit. Those are the two biggest factors of the second half versus first half. North America had a great first half. We expect North America to have a great second half, continued strength. And again, our overall expectations, improved profitability year-over-year, improved margins, improved earnings per share, $6 billion of free cash flow, another record year. And the performance that we generated in the first half is supportive of that, and that's why we took our guidance up as well. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. That's helpful. And then I guess on the Lyft partnership, obviously seems off to a pretty good start. Can you share with us what sort of milestones or maybe concrete obligations of the partnership we could expect over the next few years? Are there any specific things we should be looking for? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think when we put together the alliance it was built on four aspects. One was what we're already doing with Express Drive. Two, the power of using the vehicles that have the capability that OnStar provides. That's already underway. There's an opportunity to cross-market, and I think that's something we're just beginning to look at. Clearly getting Lyft's customers into our vehicles through Express Drive gives them exposure to the cars from a styling, from a technology \u2013 the whole value proposition that we have across our brands in GM products, and then demonstrating autonomous capability in a sharing environment. So those were the four pillars the alliance was on. As I said, those are all on track and are accomplishing exactly what we intended to do. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : That is great to hear. Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you, operator. And I want to thank everybody for participating on the call today. I think if you step back and look, not only this quarter, but what we've demonstrated over the last several quarters, we really have very strong earnings power in this company, and I think, that demonstrates why GM is a compelling investment opportunity. We know the industry well. We know it comes with challenges and twists and turns, but we also know it comes with opportunities. I think we've shown in this quarter and quarter after quarter that we have the right mindset and are holding ourselves accountable to overcome headwinds, to seize opportunities and to meet our commitments with no excuses. The leadership across the company, which I'm very proud of, are pushing themselves to beat the targets we put in front of us. They want to win and they want to continue to drive value for our customers and for our owners. So we'll continue to execute our plan with discipline to keep driving profitable growth, generating strong returns on invested capital, and creating shareholder value as we really focus on putting the customer at the center of everything we do. So thanks again for your participation in our call today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, October 25, 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to Randy Arickx, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2016. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we've included key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide brief opening remarks followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO, and then we'll open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer to assist in answering your questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for joining. GM delivered strong earnings and achieved several third quarter records that included net income, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted-adjusted and adjusted automotive free cash flow. Here are just a few of the year-over-year highlights. Net income increased 104% to $2.8 billion as net revenue rose 10% to $42.8 billion, which is an all-time record. EBIT-adjusted was up 14% to $3.5 billion. EBIT-adjusted margin was 8.3%, up 0.3 percentage points and EPS diluted-adjusted was up nearly 15% to $1.72. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $3.8 billion, up from $0.8 billion last year and ROIC adjusted of 30.6% on a trailing four-quarter basis was an all-time record continuing the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. Given our outstanding performance this year, we are on track to deliver a record 2016 on top of a record 2015 and a very strong 2014. In addition, we expect to be at the high end of our full-year EPS diluted adjusted guidance of $5.50 to $6 per share. We also completed our initial $5 billion share buyback commitment a quarter early and we'll be purchasing additional shares in the fourth quarter. We had very strong performances in North America and China. So let me cover a few of the highlights. In North America, our disciplined retail-focused strategy is paying off. U.S. retail share grew 0.4 percentage points for the highest Q3 share in five years. Chevrolet posted its best Q3 U.S. retail performance in 10 years and Buick's best in 11 years. Our Q3 ATP of almost $36,000 exceeded the industry by nearly $5,000. On the incentive front, although we are operating in an extremely competitive environment, we remain committed to our disciplined go-to-market strategy with a focus on retail customers and Chuck will have more to say about that in just a few minutes. We also announced the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV range of 238 miles at a price of $37,495 before tax incentives. So the final cost to customers can be under $30,000 depending on their tax situation. We also have eight of the 2017 North America car, truck and utility of the year semi-finalist. We have the Cruze from Chevrolet and the Bolt EV, we have the GMC Acadia, we have the Cadillac CTS and XT5 and the Buick LaCrosse, Cascada and Envision. I would also say just yesterday, we had very strong results from consumer reports for Buick. Even with the volatility from a market and pricing perspective as we look at China, China was able to post year-to-date retail sales through September \u2013 and through September GM and its joint ventures delivered 2.7 million units, which is up 9% year-over-year. We had six new launches from our Chevrolet, Buick and Baojun brand. Buick and Baojun set Q3 sales records, driven by the Excelle GT, the Envision and the Verano Notchback and also for Baojun driven by the Baojun 560 and the 730. In Cadillac, retail sales rose a record 79% in the quarter on strong sales of the XT5, the XTS, the ATSL and our year-to-date retail sales for China are up 35%. For Europe, through the first nine months of the year, we broke even. In fact, at the end of H1, we were on plan to breakeven for the full year. Because of the UK referendum and the resulting devaluation of the British pound, we continue to expect that we will incur about $400 million impact in the second-half of the year, and the team is working extremely hard to minimize the effect of this headwind. But, even with the Brexit situation, our Opel, Vauxhall brands continue to show strength. Through September, sales are up 5% year-to-date on the Astra's strong performance. And we also have introductions of the refreshed MOKKA X and Zafira that are laying the foundation for future growth. In addition to the progress I reviewed so far, Q3 \u2013 through Q3, we have realized $3.7 billion of the $5.5 billion target in cost efficiencies by 2018 and this is off a 2014 baseline. These savings will more than offset incremental investments in brand building, engineering, and the technology investments we are making, as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond. Because of the progress we've made, we are confident that we can exceed the $5.5 billion target and we intend to use these additional savings to offset our investments in the future of personal mobility where we see tremendous return potential. We also are seeing positive results on our strategy to consolidate global architectures and powertrains. Production of the Cadillac XT5 and the GMC Acadia. The first two models on our new crossover platform are nearly fully ramped up and the new Buick LaCrosse, Baojun, (7:20) Malibu on the mid-sized platform and the Chevrolet Cruze Hatchback variant is launching on the new compact car architecture. Because these new global architectures and powertrains are so efficient from a mass and a fuel economy standpoint, we can use them for multiple lifecycles and this will enable significant reuse of our capital and the ability to deploy elsewhere in the business. From the perspective of talking about personal mobility, we are leveraging our technical expertise in the core business to lead in the future of personal mobility for our customers. We are expanding our EV leadership with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the Opel Ampera-e. They both go into production this quarter, and they'll surprise a lot of people in terms of performance, range, connectivity and styling. We are also testing 30 self-driving Chevrolet Bolt EVs on public roads in Scottsdale, Arizona and San Francisco with autonomous vehicle trainers. Our Maven personal mobility brand has seen rapid growth through its launch nine months ago. We expect to be in 15 markets by the end of 2016 with nearly 10,000 vehicles, and we've launched three services on the Maven platform, the City, Residential and Express Drive variants. 70% of Maven's customers are millennials that live in urban areas, and nearly 90 employees, 60 who are from outside of General Motors, 40% are millennials and they have collective experience of launching over 40 startups and as a team hold 117 patents. So, we really have an energized team running our Maven business. When we look at connectivity, we are building on our 20-year lead with OnStar. We expect to have nearly 12 million connected customers globally by the end of the year, and we've transitioned the OnStar RemoteLink app to our vehicle brands. Customer engagement is up with 150 million interactions year-to-date versus the 135 million we had for all of 2015. And lastly, we have nearly 500 customers that have enrolled in our Smart Driver service since its launch in July. They can use this service to autonomously (9:32) seek insurance discount for good driving practices. So every winning quarter we continue to demonstrate what the earnings power is of General Motors. The team's performance this quarter is further evidence that we are doing what we say we are going to do. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results through the first nine months of the year. In addition to another record quarter, we also put up some very strong results year-to-date. EBIT-adjusted through September grew to a record $10.1 billion, up $2.1 billion on a year-over-year basis. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 8.3%, up a 110 basis points year-over-year. The positive results were broad-based with all but one of our automotive regions posting year-over-year profit improvement during the first nine months of the year. Our strong year-to-date results were led by record results in North America, sustained strong performance in China, and breakeven results in Europe. And our performance year-to-date clearly demonstrates that we're on track to meet our commitment and deliver another year of strong results. In North America, EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $9.4 billion for the first nine months of the year, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was a record at 10.7%, up 20 basis points year-over-year, and in line with our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the year. In fact, North America has achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for five of the last six quarters. The underlying strength of the U.S. industry continues to support our strong earnings in North America. We expect the U.S light vehicle industry to be in the low to mid 17 million SAAR range for the year. And we also continue to expect the industry will remain strong, albeit in a plateau environment over the next number of years. However, given the recent increased interest in industry incentive and inventory levels, I'd like to spend a few additional minutes to share our view. Cleary, we recognize the industry is increasingly competitive, especially as consumer preferences are shifting away from sedans and more towards SUVs and trucks. We've remained absolutely committed to our disciplined retail-focused go-to-market strategy, and we have demonstrated that by managing supply and demand, and through disciplined pricing. In fact on average, our third quarter incentives as a percentage of transaction price significantly under paced the industry. GM was up 30 basis points year-over-year, but the industry was up 80 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, our transaction prices increased at approximately twice the rate of industry during this time period. Q3 incentive levels were influenced by our sell-down of the 2016 model year vehicles, resulting in a model year changeover pace ahead of where we were last year. Current model year product now makes up more than half of our dealer inventory, which is approximately 15 points better than last year's status at this point in time. Our aggregate dealer inventories are up year-over-year, increasing the availability of our recently launched products, like the Cadillac XT5, GMC Acadia, and the Chevrolet Cruze and Malibu. And given our dealer footprint, our days supply is well-positioned at 79 days, as it's important to have sufficient inventory as we move into the strongest seasonal pickup market, coupled with holiday-related downtime in Q4. Looking ahead to Q4 and beyond, we would expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remains strong and we build dealer stocks ahead of our upcoming crossover launches in 2017. We also expect days supply to fluctuate before moderating by year-end. Having said that, as we've demonstrated in the past, our inventory levels will be dictated by matching supply with demand. We will continue to watch inventories closely, especially cars, and will take actions if and when required. We also expect our incentive levels to moderate in Q4 as we benefit from a higher mix of newer model sales, increased availability of our most recently launched products, and an expected strong finish to the year for U.S. industry SAAR levels. As you may have already seen, incentives as a percentage of transaction price for the industry are trending down in October, per J.D. Power's mid-month data. And our incentives as a percentage of transaction price are also expected to trend down as we progress throughout the month and the rest of the quarter. It's clear our go-to market strategy is working, and we remain confident in the health of the U.S. industry. Okay. Let's move on to the rest of the world. China continues to deliver solid results, with equity income of $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year, about equal to a year ago, with net income margin remaining strong at 9.3%. In South America, as you all know, macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. We continue to work to offset these pressures and take the necessary steps to set us up for future success. Our efforts are paying off. In spite of the challenging environment, worse than what we experienced in 2015, the team has narrowed losses by nearly $300 million this year compared to 2015. Shifting to Europe. Despite the ongoing effects of Brexit, the region posted breakeven results for the first nine months of the year, an improvement of $500 million year-over-year, and the best performance year-to-date since the third quarter of 2011. Clearly, we have made substantial progress towards our breakeven target in 2016. However, we continue to face headwinds related to the UK referendum. And as all of you know, the British pound continues to fall to lows not seen in decades. As we indicated back in the second quarter, we continue to estimate that Brexit could have a negative impact of up to $400 million in the second half of 2016, which includes over $100 million already incurred in the third quarter. The team continues to remain focused on making progress on our turnaround plans in Europe, and we will continue working to partially offset these headwinds to the best of our ability. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $5.2 billion for the first nine months of the year, up $2.7 billion year-over-year. These results include an increase of $1.5 billion in capital spending, as we make portfolio investments in our product lineup consistent with our previously communicated plan. As a reminder, Q4 cash flow tends to be weak due to seasonality, however we remain on track to generate approximately $6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return of capital to shareholders, in line with our capital allocation framework. We've returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through the first nine months of the year, including $1.8 billion in common stock dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion program ahead of schedule. We expect to repurchase additional shares in the fourth quarter as we work towards the $4 billion in share repurchases we committed to completing by the end of 2017. Finally, with regard to our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Given our very strong year-to-date results and our current outlook for Q4, we now expect 2016 full-year diluted earnings per share adjusted to be at the high end of the $5.50 to $6 range per diluted adjusted share. It is clear that we've accomplished a lot already this year, and we fully expect 2016 to be another record year for the company. We're in the process of finalizing our 2017 planning assumptions, and we'll provide you with additional color in January on what to expect for the year. However, we do expect a continuation of strong earnings in 2017, as North America's results will be favorably impacted by our strong launch cadence of new crossovers, as well as a continuation of positive cost efficiencies around the globe. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli, Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. So, Chuck, can you \u2013 just on 2017, I know, it's early for guidance in detail, I think, the slides do still talk about GM expecting a kind of positive earnings trajectory. So the initial thought is that earnings can still go up next year versus this year, and then maybe if you can give us a little bit more detail on the various kinds of puts and takes to think about when modeling 2017? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Itay, we'll have more to say on \u2013 at the Deutsche Bank Conference in January, specifically around the details on how we see earnings shaping up in 2017, but with that said, absent an unforeseen economic development either in the U.S. or China, and we certainly don't foresee any, we would expect GM to deliver improved EPS diluted-adjusted in 2017, which is consistent with what we've been talking about for some time now. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. That's very helpful. And then just secondly, can you help us a little bit more to think about how you're thinking about China in the fourth quarter, given the environment and the tax incentives, as well as what you're kind of seeing in terms of inventory levels and pricing going into the fourth quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well. I would say, there is certainly a little uncertainty around the tax incentive, and the way that will \u2013 when that may end, and that's had an impact on the strength of the Chinese market calendar year-to-date. Absent some announcement by the government, we'd expect Q4 to be strong as well in the range of 9% to 10% up year-over-year. We've seen, so far in October the industry in sales continue to run very well. We still expect to see strong equity income consistent with our guidance to generate about $2 billion of equity income for the year, and pricing continues to be a significant challenge. We've been able to offset that on a year-to-date basis with improvements in mix and continued material cost efficiencies. So it feels to me kind of more of the same in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we've seen in the first three quarters of the year. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. And just lastly maybe strategic question for Mary. I think, last month, John Zimmer from Lyft kind of predicted that the majority of Lyft's rides will be autonomous within five years. I was curious if that's \u2013 that comment is part of your plan with Lyft in terms of the on demand network partnership? And maybe, if you could give us an update on kind of how you're looking at the trajectory on these efforts going forward? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. We are making great progress on the autonomous development. As I mentioned, we have a fleet now running, not only in San Francisco, but also in Scottsdale, so 30 vehicles on the road. And that's important because it's not just the miles, but it's really the experiences and the scenarios that they continue to learn every day and I'm very pleased with the team's performance. As we look at launching autonomous into the marketplace, we believe it will first happen in a controlled environment, in a ride-sharing environment, hence the alliance that we did with Lyft, as well as the work that we're doing with Maven. But as we see it going into ride sharing, that's because it will be geo-fenced, you're going to have limitations with speed and other limitations, and that's why the ownership will stay with the company in these first models as we continue to learn. And so, that path is very much on track, but I will say what is going to gate our launching of autonomous vehicles into the marketplace for consumers is safety. And we are working very hard with the experience that we have to do that in the safest manner possible because it does then really address the issues that we have of over 90% of fatalities in today \u2013 in today's U.S. streets are human error. And so, we think we can make a big dent on that so we'll be gated by safety, but once we feel that we've got the right system, we're working with our regulators, we have the scale to put those vehicles into production extremely quickly. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): That's very helpful. Thanks so much everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. I had a couple questions. One is just, I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit on the outlook for pricing and profitability in North America. Yeah, you've done a very good job of keeping inventories at good levels and have had really good results on pricing. Of course everybody is noticing some increasingly aggressive actions from competitors, Ram (23:50) incentives are at 16% of average transaction prices. This quarter we're seeing a number of retailers talking about margin compression in new. This morning FCA talked about over 600,000 units of additional truck capacity in 2018, and I think, IHS is projecting something like 13% increase in GM production in Q4. So I was hoping, just in the context of all these things that we all see, can you talk about, number one, the GM production outlook and maybe a little bit more on the levers that you can pull to sustain 10% margins in North America as we look out to next year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, sure. Let me start kind of at 10,000 feet and work my way down a little bit. I already spoke to our inventory level, and we feel our inventory level is appropriate given our dealer footprint, and what's really driven the increase in inventory which is filling out inventory on newly launched products and new entries that we didn't have before like the CT6 or the Envision as an example. And continuing to work on inventory for our compact crossover so that we have sufficient supply as we look to change those models over in 2017. From a pricing incentive perspective, clearly the market in general is getting more competitive and there is some aggressiveness from a truck perspective, but I step back and look at the overall strength of our three-truck strategy, the light duty, heavy duty and mid-size trucks, we've been able to maintain discipline around that, grow retail share and increase our transaction prices in spite of some of this, and I think, it's fundamentally driven by the very, very strong product, relative to the truck capacity coming on stream. We could sell more vehicles, if we have more vehicles from a truck perspective today, and hence one of the clear focus areas on the retail side of the business. You also need to peel the onion a bit on where are we \u2013 where is the industry actually adding capacity, is it in trucks, is it in SUVs, is it in crossovers, because again we believe we're well-positioned. We have dominant share in full-size SUVs and our full-size pickup trucks continue to perform very well. To your last point or how do we continue to see earnings be sustained from a North American standpoint, and I think, there's two or three fundamental drivers to that, Rod. Number one, we're running at different play and it's generating different results. We're very focused on retail in a very disciplined way. Our retail market share is up, we're less reliant on less profitable daily rental, and that's showing up in our results. We also have our very, very strong product launch cadence, so this year we fundamentally rolled over our entire passenger car portfolio, and next year we'll start the strong launch cadence of completely refreshing crossovers, small, compact and mid-size over the next 12 months to 18 months; and that's critical, that's a lot of volume, it's highly profitable and we expect to see that. We also expect to see continued improvements from a cost standpoint. North America fundamentally enjoys the large benefit of that $5.5 billion of cost efficiency, and as Mary indicated, we're looking to drive that even higher and that's going to be fundamentally from a material performance, logistics performance and we'll continue to streamline manufacturing and SG&A. Taking all that together, we're confident and constructive that under a plateaued industry environment that we can continue to sustain strong margins in North America like we have done over the past couple of years. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. And could you confirm that what IHS is calling for vis-\u00e0-vis GM's Q4 production; and on a separate track, if you can maybe talk a little bit about scenario planning for China? Right now your volume is up 9%, there's been some margin pressure, which you guys have pointed to, but you're keeping earnings flat. I'd imagine that some \u2013 to some degree there is some demand pulled forward. So if we were to think about a flat market in China or something significantly flatter, what would \u2013 how would that effect GM's equity earnings outlook? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Let me \u2013 when you're talking about fourth quarter production, are you talking about total or trucks or what? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: IHS is calling for North America production in the fourth quarter for GM, last I checked I think it was an October update of being up 13% year-over-year. I'm not sure if that's correct, but it seems like a fairly big increase just given the trends that we've been observing? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. We worked through the launch cadence of our recently launched products, we would expect overall production to be up in the fourth quarter marginally from the third quarter, and obviously what plays into that are the Christmas holidays and everything else, but we would expect production to be up. Relative to China and the specific questions around planning assumptions in China, we've been able to maintain strong equity income and strong margins through continuing to launch new products, improved mix, and material performance which is fundamentally offset price headwinds. Obviously, this year the industry is running stronger than we expected, because of some uncertainty around the purchase tax incentive, if that was to end and the government was to announce an end to that, our planning assumption would be that \u2013 there could be some volatility in maybe the first quarter and second quarter of next year, but then we would still expect the industry to continue on that growth path towards 30 million units and as we've talked before, a little bit more volatile growth pattern and in the kind of low single digit range over the next number of years, again it really depends on what's announced from the government's perspective, we have no insight on that. We certainly expect the pricing dynamic to continue and that's why we're so focused on our product launch cadence and I would say similar to the U.S., our product launch cadence in China is heavily weighted towards SUVs and crossovers over the next number of years as well as Cadillac products which is going to help from a mix standpoint. All that said, more to say in January around specifics, but we would expect China equity income to continue to be strong. We would expect margins over time to be compressed. They're at somewhat unnaturally high levels at from an industry perspective for the foreign OEMs, but still be generating strong overall equity income. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a first question on truck pricing, because there seems to be some hyperbole around elasticity of demand to pricing. I'm just curious, when you think about pricing on trucks and what you're seeing in the competitive environment, I mean if one competitor cuts price, do they tend to pull forward their own demand or do they tend to conquest sales, I'm just trying to understand what's going on here, because it really \u2013 there seems to be a belief that price cutting can drive significant conquesting and I'm just curious how you think about that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think that you really need to peel the truck market down almost cab type by cab type and trim level by trim level, because price elasticity in our view becomes less relevant the more you move up from a trim level perspective and a cab level perspective. First, truck buyers are the most loyal of any customer. The loyalty rates of truck buyers are north of 60% and generally you are in the 50% range, so that's first, you are dealing with that aspect. Second, where there seems to be the most elasticity is at the very low end of the market. So, regular cab work type trucks and things like that, and I think that, you saw some of that play out last year when one of our competitors was very aggressive and we were losing share at the lower end, but still generating strong profits and good transaction price growth. And I think that's what we're seeing play out. So, I wouldn't paint the whole truck market pricing dynamic with one brush, you almost need to look and peel that onion back a layer or two layers. We're still performing exceptionally well up-level crew cab \u2013 our new up-level additions and higher trims that we're rolling out, and we've seen improved transaction prices and improved, actually, profitability on the current truck platform on a year-over-year basis and \u2013 despite some of the challenges at the lower end of the market. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that's very helpful. Then just a second question, could you just give us your leasing levels in the third quarter in the U.S., or sort of a percentage of sales? And what you think the industry roughly was in the quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. The industry was \u2013 and this is broad strokes, John, but I think directionally correct, in the 27%, 28% range, and we're a little bit lower than that from a leasing perspective in Q3. 24% for us, and that's down from highs earlier this year of close to 30%. So, typically we would be a few percentage points below the industry average just because of the mix, less trucks are leased. So \u2013 but that's kind of where the dynamic's at \u2013 and what we're seeing is, lease penetration at an industry level is up kind of the same amount that subvented financing is down, right. As the market is dealing with low interest rates and people are still looking for payments that they used to get through subvented financing. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it, that's helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, on cap allocation, I personally would pretty much agree with the way that you're going after this. But clearly what we're seeing in the stock is there \u2013 the market is maybe disagreeing with cap allocation and where we are in the cycle. I'm just curious, would you ever consider storing more of this cash on the balance sheet to create a larger buffer and maybe calm some market concerns which appear to be out there, given what the stock is doing, and maybe taking advantage of a buyback or redistribution of capital to shareholders as the cycle progresses and maybe goes to the downside, or are you going to stay in the stalwart path of sort of $10 billion roughly of net cash and excess free cash flow above and beyond that will just be redistributed through buybacks? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. We did a lot of work around our original capital allocation framework in the targeted $20 billion of cash. We looked at the business. We looked at what it was going to take to run the business through the cycle, to ensure that we can continue to invest appropriately through the cycle, because that's one of the lessons learned, and to ensure that we could maintain the dividend through the cycle, through a typical 25% downturn. That is the basis for our targeted cash. We will continue to reevaluate that depending on market dynamics, but \u2013 and we do on a regular basis, but there was a lot of work to come up with that $20 billion. And fundamentally, we're making all the investments that we want to make from a capital spending perspective. We're making the investments we want to make from an innovation technology standpoint. And at the end of the day, $20 billion is what we really need to run this business and manage it through a cycle, maintain the dividends. So under that construct, what's available from a free cash flow perspective should come back to our owners, and we also have a revolver. Obviously, our intent was not to draw that in a downturn, but that's an emergency backstop in the event of some unforeseen issue or a deeper-than-typical downturn, and that's available to us as well. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I am sorry, Chuck, just one follow-up on that. I mean, you talked about $20 billion of gross cash. You didn't mention the net cash. I mean, is there a potential that you would consider taking on some leverage to buy back the stock? I mean, right now the market cap is 2.8 times your trailing EBITDA, it's pretty inexpensive growth basis right now. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Going back to our overall capital allocation framework. First and foremost, invest appropriately in the business through the cycle to drive, sustain 20% plus return on invested capital and invest in the future for technology and innovation. Second, maintain an investment grade balance sheet, and we're targeting to run the company at a single A rating, because we think that's the right thing to do from a financial risk management perspective and to support GM Financial, which will ultimately lead to significantly improved earnings at the finance company, but also at the car company. So, we don't \u2013 we feel today, when you look at our overall external debt and our \u2013 the position of our underfunded pensions, that we have the appropriate amount of leverage. We do not want to overlay financial leverage on top of operating leverage in this business, because that's another lesson learned from the last significant downturn that we went through. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question, which is on Europe. I think that the guidance back in July was maybe $400 million of Brexit impact in the back half of 2016 or $800 million annualized, but it looks like you called out just $100 million in 3Q or more like $400 million annualized. So, with a quarter's worth of results in Europe post-Brexit, do you now have a different assessment of the annualized financial impact? September SAAR in Western Europe, I think, was like the strongest since May of 2009. I wonder if maybe when you guided to the annualized impact back in July, if perhaps you had assumed lower industry volumes that have yet to, at least so far, materialize. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Let me go back to what we talked about in July, because I think it was you that asked the question, Ryan, when we were talking about the $400 million impact in the second half of the year and you kept pushing me on, what's the calendar year impact. And I think I said early days, but an indication would be, take the $400 million and multiply it by two, right. A full year impact of the second half, pound sterling only, without a lot of insight on what was happening from an industry perspective and everything else. And I'll circle back to that in a minute, but I just wanted to kind of set the foundation for that $800 million. It wasn't a well-studied kind of guidance. It was a general directional answer to a conservation you and I were having on the last earnings call. We did guide to the second half impact of $400 million. We are holding to that guidance. What manifested itself was $100 million in the third quarter. So, that would leave a residual $300 million in the fourth quarter on the basis of our crystal ball today on where we're landing from a pound sterling perspective. The reason, it was more backend loaded, obviously, we had some hedges in places that helped in the third quarter to mitigate that to a certain extent. And the pound is we can further, since we provided that guidance. So, we still expect, for the second half of the year, in the range of $400 million headwind associated with Brexit, primarily related to the pound sterling and that's primarily now a fourth quarter issue, about $300 million of that residual would fall into the fourth quarter, which will certainly make our challenge of breakeven in Europe very, very difficult especially when you think about the seasonality of earnings and everything else. Just looking at the pound sterling impact itself. Pick an exchange rate, at the end of Q2, we were at $1.28, $1.29. The last I checked this morning, we are at $1.22. There is a several hundred million dollar headwind on our long pound sterling position that in and of itself in 2017 if I was picking a point today would be significant. But there are number of actions that we're working through with the European team to mitigate as much of that as we can. More to come, in January, but certainly the environment in Europe is challenging and uncertain, and very volatile at this point in time. From an industry standpoint, I agree with you that performance in Western Europe has been strong and strong through the third quarter and frankly it was even strong in the UK, but again when you look at the sales, there were a lot of fleet sales in Q3, a lot of very unprofitable fleet sales in Q3. We didn't necessarily participate in it, but there is a lot of inventory being kind of unloaded. I would expect and we still expect to see the industry pull back as we exit this year and go into next year to a certain extend as OEM start to price. We raised prices 2.5% on October 1, our intelligence suggests Volkswagen followed, not to that full level, but followed as well. And that \u2013 in and of itself along with consumer sentiment issues should \u2013 will drive some pullback from an industry standpoint. So, we'll have to see how that plays out. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful color. Thank you. My final question is on consolidated international operations, looks like the loss there narrowed quite a bit sequentially, that was actually the biggest difference versus our model. So what is the plan and sort of the cadence to walking this region back to say breakeven? Maybe remind us of the timing and the magnitude of the savings coming from winding down manufacturing costs in Australia and if you could share if there are any other catalysts or step changes in profitability in the region that investors might have to look forward to? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I would say, our approach in all of our operations, including the consolidated operation is to put in place, a path to drive these businesses to viability and appropriate returns, and if not to take action. And exiting manufacturing in Australia was one of those. We should be through that by the end of 2017, all else equal that would be worth a $100 million to $150 million a year in savings from a manufacturing cost perspective once we exit that activity. Again scheduled at the end of 2017. We've already exited or significantly downsized our vehicle manufacturing, car manufacturing activity in Thailand. We ceased manufacturing in Indonesia. I would suggest we are looking at all of our operations there and as we've indicated in the Q, there could be additional significant restructurings, depending on whether we can identify the path forward, because we're just not going to absorb the kinds of losses that we've seen there on an ongoing basis. So, I would suggest there is likely more actions to come. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, Mary. I got one for you first and I'd be particularly interested in your answer to this question as an engineer by training and profession. So, as the ADAS \u2013 and the question is about ADAS, cars still with steering wheels but a lot safer, and our dialog with suppliers and regulators, especially as these systems mature in the market and they get the data to show the vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian empirical data the reductions are very significant, sometimes 30% or 50% depending on the accident. My question for you is, Mary, how much does it cost per unit to make your vehicles order of magnitude like a third safer, 30% or 50% safer? Is it hundreds of dollars, is it a thousand, or is it in the thousands of dollars, just order of magnitude? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, Adam, we don't really disclose that type of pricing from a technology perspective. What I would say is if you look at our vehicles, there's tremendous safety features on them already, whether it's airbags or the lane detection, emergency braking, rear object detection, and even when you back up from a perpendicular perspective. And a lot of the technologies on the vehicle today that we have put on and offset to a large extent the technology for safety are finding cost improvements, material cost improvements and just overall design and efficiency of the vehicle. And the way I look at it is all this technology is making the driver safer today on the roads. We'll continue on that journey, but I think the real step function happens with autonomous, because you really then get to a point, again, if you've implemented autonomous very safely and really understand all the dynamics that will happen, there's an infinite number of situations that drivers and our vehicles will see and how you respond to those is going to be critical. That's where you get the step function improvement. So I don't see it as it's $300 gets you this, $500 gets you this. That's not really the way we look at it. We continue to look at how do we incorporate the safety technology into the vehicle, looking at affordability today, and I would call that the evolutionary path, and then autonomous is more of the revolutionary path, and we're working to drive those costs down, but again we have ensured those in detail. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. The reason why I ask is because, although fully autonomous is a noble initiative, and it's coming and to get the real 95% to 100% type reductions, it seems we can't \u2013 if there are technologies that are vastly easier to implement and more affordable in an ownership model that can lead to a 50% reduction, that's worth implementing as well. It just raises industry questions about the insurability of the vehicles that you're selling today without these systems and the value that they would have in the secondhand markets. We'll continue that discussion. Maybe, Chuck, a question for you then lastly. You mentioned the goal of $6 billion of adjusted auto free cash flow. When I look year to date, though, and take the $10 billion of automotive operating cash flow and I take out CapEx, I get a number of $3.2 billion. So I guess when you say adjusted, there are some changes you're making to that number; because you're not implying you're going to make almost $3 billion as free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Is that fair? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. The noise in that is pension. So... Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So we funded that with debt, so you just add the $2 billion, so the $3.2 billion you get $5.2 billion of free cash flow ex-pension contribution. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Because I guess the big investor question we're getting is, that is a competition for the cash, right. And even if it's not every year, they are with some regular frequency. So like last year you made $5 of earnings; but the free cash flow per share, including the pension contributions and a lot of other unusual stuff, was about $1.30. So there was a big gap. You're narrowing that gap this year. Maybe if you include the pension funding, you get to close to half like (49:13) to maybe if you do $6 plus of earnings and you do $3 of free cash flow a share, but you still have that gap. So the question, Chuck, is will this gap be narrowed so that your $6 or so of earnings can really reflect cash earnings as well? And what are the factors you think that can drive the narrowing of that gap? Thanks. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. First, just, let's go back to the pension just to be clear, that was a debt-for-debt funding, right. And for display purposes, on a GAAP basis, it's taking out of operating cash flow, obviously free cash flow would add back in because it's debt-for-debt. So the $5.2 billion is the right adjusted free cash flow number and consistent with our $6 billion target free cash flow at the end of the year and that's what we'll apply to our capital allocation framework. When you look at our overall difference between EPS and cash, obviously, we have cash taxes, and that's going to be and have been roughly $1 billion a year. Capital spending is higher than D&A, because we've underspent for a number of years and it's going to take a while to catch that up. And pensions; at the end of the day, we have pension income that is non-cash that gets reversed. So I would say that, as we look forward, the way I think about it is our conversion ratio should improve on a go-forward basis, because incremental EBIT is highly levered to cash flow on a go-forward basis and that's what I've talked about before. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So the gap has got to be driven by operational improvement. There is nothing else in the adjustments that you see improving that gap. That's how I'm interpreting that. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, over time, there will be puts and takes. D&A is going to obviously catch up, and our cash tax rates or our ultimate cash tax payment will increase versus where we are today over time, and we'll start to accrue GMF dividends. But over the next two years or three years, it's going to be operational improvement and leverage. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. A quick housekeeping question and then a more strategic question. Housekeeping is, Chuck, you had mentioned fourth quarter production could be sequentially up. Just to clarify, IHS forecasts a lot of (51:53) 14% year-over-year in 4Q in North America. That's down somewhat sequentially just given the holiday. So just wanted to clarify what you're expecting. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So we expect sequentially 2016 Q4 versus 2016 Q3 to be up slightly, maybe 3% on a FUS basis, right, our factory unit sale basis, which would be production plus imports versus 2015 Q4, it looks like we'll be up 150,000 units or so, all things equal, on the basis of our outlook right now. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. The more strategic question is China over the summer has made more noise about new energy vehicles. Europe, culminating in the German Bundestag floating an idea of eliminating ICE sales by 2030. So (52:57) just three propositions. One, do you think there is a realistic possibility that China and Europe actually get the EV penetrations mid next decade, well ahead of the U.S.? Two, given their penchant for favoring the home team, how are you positioned? And in particular, we hear most of what you're doing around electrification and autonomous for U.S. markets; but how are you thinking about those internationally? And three, how do you think it's going to affect the mid-term to longer term profitability of those regions? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So clearly, we believe that China is going to lead in the penetration of electric vehicles into the market, and that's why we've announced that we have 10 new energy vehicles coming out. I would say we're also the only OEM that actually manufactures batteries in-country right now. Clearly, we have the strength of the products that we have available to sell globally, with the second generation Volt as well as the Bolt EV and the Ampera-e, along with many other electrified products in China. So we definitely see that trend. I think one of the things, though, and this is where we also have an advantage with our PATAC Engineering Center, that we can really leverage the supply base and that volume in China to really help us globally from a electrification perspective, and we intend to do that. I would also say, from a European perspective, we definitely are seeing more of a move, and we'll be announcing the Ampera-e next year that, with some of the different issues associated with emissions, there is a much stronger interest and focus on electrification. We clearly think the highest market will be China. I think we'll see progress in both the U.S. and Europe. I would also say, though, we've got some very good diesel products that we're launching, both cars and trucks, that are getting very good market reception. And so I think it's too soon to exactly call how the penetration is going to be, but definitely probably more significant than we thought maybe a year or two ago. And clearly, we've got to get the scale and get the engineering work done, that we can have minimal impact from a margin perspective. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And I guess, similar for autonomy, do you think China will accelerate and, maybe not surpass the U.S., but pull even with it, just given the density of the populations in the urban centers? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Again, there's so many issues that have to be resolved to be able to say who is going to be first. Not only is it getting safe technology deployed \u2013 and I think we're in a excellent position, that we intend to be among the first or the first with safe autonomous vehicles. And then we do have the capacity to build those at scale. But you have to look at how the regulatory environment will impact around the globe, and in China, there are certain restrictions to mapping technology as well. So I think there is a lot to play out to right now call who is going to lead. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our final question today comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. The first question was just on the incentive spending commentary in North America \u2013 or in the U.S. I guess, that you mentioned earlier, down as a percent of ATPs in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. And you mentioned the October data point. But, first of all, isn't that always the case at this time of year as the model mix changes? I guess what I was wondering is if you could give us a sense of, if you believe, on a like-for-like basis, incentive spending for the industry and for GM will be flat, up, or down on a year-over-year basis in the quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I guess I would just look at the trend year-to-date. The trend year-to-date is that the industry, the incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price through the first three quarters of the year is up on a year-over-year basis. Off the top of my head, 60 basis points to 70 basis points, so somewhere from a 10.6% to 11.3%, we're generally in that range as well, maybe 11.4%. I would expect, and you're right, typically, depending on how the model changes are going for all of the competition, Q4 has a tendency to ramp down a little bit, because you've launched the new model of your vehicles, for us specifically, because we're in really good shape from that perspective, but we'd expect the industry broadly to follow that same trend. But I'd also expect on a year-over-year basis, it will be up, consistent with what's happened in the first nine months of the year. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Okay. And then one quick one on the free cash flow guidance, which I know you reiterated for this year; and I think back in January over 16 to 18, you called for a $6 billion to $7 billion range. A, I guess I want to understand if you think that range is still valid? And then I know, Mary, at the beginning of the call, you said some investment might be funded by greater-than-expected cost efficiencies. But can you give us an indication of how much within that $6 billion to $7 billion is actually a headwind from spending on items such as electrification, autonomous, or other ventures? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, one, we'll have more specific guidance on beyond 2016 in January, but generally speaking, we would expect to generate strong cash flow over the next number of years, and we haven't changed our perspective on that. And this year's $6 billion is, we're on track to deliver that. Relative to this, the second question, and I'll let Mary speak to it as well. But free cash flow is after we make investments and everything else. So, obviously, if we expect to continue to maintain strong cash flow, that's after we've funded investments in autonomous or engineering for autonomous or future technologies, just as \u2013 broadly speaking. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: That's absolutely correct. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. I guess what I was wondering is, said another way, how much higher would it have been if you weren't making investments (59:35)? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I kind of figured that was your question. And I'm not quite ready to \u2013 think we're ready to go out and start to saying, we're investing X on autonomous vehicle or future technology engineering, because you got to kind of \u2013 what technology are you speaking to specifically? I would suggest, versus the previous plan as we really started to ramp up. Our activities around autonomous vehicles, the amount that we're spending does not have a B attached to it. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: And I would also say, the efficiencies that we're seeing when you can reuse our contextures that we have on \u2013 that are launching or have on the road right now and you look at the development costs to do the next-generation architecture versus reusing, that's all as I mentioned, investment that can be redeployed in the transformative technology. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks lot, guys. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Randy Arickx. Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.: And I'll hand it over to Mary for closing remarks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Great, thanks. Thanks, everybody, for participating. I hope you can see we are working hard to make sure the core business is operating in a very disciplined fashion and we have the opportunity for continued strong performance. And that is key because we are then investing in the transformative technologies that we've just talked about, building on our leading connectivity, building on the strong options that we have in the marketplace now and we'll continue to launch with the Volt, with Bolt EV and with other electrification products, as well as our work in fuel cells. We are being very aggressive from an autonomous perspective and leveraging the knowledge that we have to do that safely, and then also from a sharing perspective with both the alliance with Lyft and with Maven. So we understand this is a ever-challenging global marketplace, but I hope that you see that we are a very focused and disciplined leadership team and we're going to continue to execute our plans and drive profitable growth. I really appreciate everybody participating today and I look forward to talking to you next year. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you disconnect your lines. Thank you. Have a nice day.",

GM delivered a second straight year of record earnings in 2016, setting records for net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margins, EPS diluted-adjusted and automotive-adjusted free cash flow. Highlights and results for the full year include net revenue of $166 billion, up 9% year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted of $12.5 billion, up nearly 16% from a year ago. EBIT-adjusted margins of 7.5%, up more than 40 basis points. Net income of $9.4 billion, EPS-diluted adjusted of $6.12, up 22%. EBIT adjusted of $12 billion in North America, up from $11 billion and EBIT-adjusted margins of more than 10% for second straight year. Automotive-adjusted free cash flow was $6.9 billion, up $4.7 billion. ROIC adjusted of nearly 29% was up 1.7 percentage points, demonstrating the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. And we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders in 2016 through a combination of share buybacks and dividends. By nearly every measure, 2016 was a great year. And this morning, we are announcing record global sales for the fourth consecutive year at nearly 10 million vehicles. This underscores the progress we are making in strengthening our brands and putting the customers at the center of everything we do. Our results last year were largely driven by growing retail share in North America, another year of record sales in China, and strong margins in both regions, so let me go a little deeper into each of the regions. First, in GM North America, GM's U.S. brands sold more than 3 million vehicles and gained a 0.5 percentage point of retail share in 2016, the largest of any full-line automaker and this is thanks to the disciplined go-to-market strategy we've been utilizing. Chevrolet was the fastest-growing U.S. brand led by strong gains in mid-size pickups, small crossovers and large SUVs, gaining a 0.5 percentage point of U.S. retail market share. In the U.S., full-year GM average transaction prices were about $35,400, about $4,300 above the industry average, and up $750 over the 2015 average. Full-year incentive spending as a percent of ATP was 12%, well below domestic and many other global competitors. And on the quality front our progress continues. Consumers Report recommended 12 GM models in its annual reliability survey and Buick was the first domestic brand included in the survey's top three brands. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the first Chevrolet Bolt EV to dealers and customers in California with an EPA estimated 238 miles of range it has won multiple awards including the 2017 North American Car of the Year, Motor Trend Car of the Year and Green Car Journal's Car of the Year and others. More launches in hot crossover segments are coming in 2018. We have the Chevrolet Equinox and Traverse, the GMC Terrain, which will join the newer entries like the GMC Acadia, the Buick Envision and the Cadillac XT5 to form one of the industry's precious line ups in the very important SUV segment. In China, China drove record sales and strong margins in a very volatile environment. GM and its joint ventures delivered nearly 3.9 million vehicles, up 7% over a record 2015. Cadillac, Buick and Baojun deliveries reached all-time high. GM launched 13 new models in 2016 and we plan to introduce 18 new or refreshed models across five brands this year. Cadillac retail sales were up nearly 46% for the year. The brand sold more than 100,000 vehicles, driving global sales up 11% to a 30-year high. And Baojun sales rose 49%, with strong products like the 730 MPV, and the 560 SUV, and the new Baojun 310 hatchback. As we look at Europe, without the negative impact of Brexit, we would have achieved breakeven in 2016. However, we're not satisfied with these results, and the team is focused on mitigating the effect through further cost efficiencies and by leveraging the momentum of a fresh Opel/Vauxhall portfolio. Opel/Vauxhall full-year sales rose 4% on the strength of the Astra, which was the European Car of the Year, along with the Zafira and the MOKKA X. Sales improved in 18 of 22 markets, including Germany. For 2017, we are planning seven launches including the Ampera-e. In South America, we see an opportunity for significant year-over-year improvement because of our continued work to restructure the business. Chevrolet continues its market leadership in our key market of Brazil, where we successfully launched 12 products in 2016, and for the second consecutive year, Onix was the top-selling vehicle. In Q4, GM led the entire region with 16.8% market share, and calendar year share was 15.9%, up a 0.5 percentage point year-over-year. So let me make a few comments also about the future of personal mobility. We made remarkable progress last year in technology and innovation, especially in the game-changing technologies that are helping us redefine personal mobility. We launched Maven, our personal mobility brand and scaled it up very quickly. It is operating in 16 cities and its Express Drive program for Lyft drivers has about 5,000 vehicles with plan to add several 100 Bolt EVs in California. And we are learning a great deal about developing transportation-as-a-service in urban markets, due to our work with Maven. By mobilizing in-house talent and acquiring Cruise Automation, we're now making progress on autonomous as well. We're testing more than 40 autonomous Bolt EVs on public roads in Metro Detroit, San Francisco, and Scottsdale. And last December, we announced that we plan to be the first high-volume OEM to build fully autonomous test vehicles in a mass production assembly plant. And in terms of connectivity, OnStar celebrated its 20th anniversary, reaching 1.5 billion customer interactions and putting nearly 12 million OnStar-connected vehicles on the road globally and entered into an industry-first partnership with IBM Watson to launch OnStar Go. So, if I look at where we are as we start 2017, I'm very proud of the progress we've made and I'm confident that we can do even more and build on our momentum. As we shared last month in the Deutsche Bank Conference, in 2017, we expect earnings per share diluted adjusted of $6 to $6.50 per share. We also expect to improve revenues and maintain or improve EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins. In addition, we expect to generate about $6 billion in automotive-adjusted free cash flow. Based on our outlook, our board approved an additional $5 billion in common stock repurchases. This increase in our stock buyback program is further proof that we are committed to driving shareholder value and we remain committed to generating strong business results that will eventually be appreciated by the market. Our projections for improved performance in 2017 are based on a number of factors. First, we have continued strong sales and income in North America and China. Economic indicators show significantly improved optimism in the U.S. economy and we believe auto sales will continue to be at or near record levels. We also have an intense focus on material, logistics, manufacturing, and general administration costs. Frankly, we're looking at cost in all areas of the business. Last month, we raised our 2018 cost efficiency target from $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. We also have growth of adjacent businesses like GM Financial, Customer Care and Aftersales, OnStar, and Maven. And finally, our strong vehicle launch cadence. We expect our percentage of global volume from new or refreshed models to grow to 38% in the 2017 through 2020 timeframe, with more than half in the popular crossover truck and SUV segments. We appreciate that there will be headwinds, but I am confident that we have the right strategy and the right team to manage them with integrity and to drive achievement of our commitments. As I said when we gave our full-year outlook, we are here to win. So now, let me turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. I'd like to provide some perspective on the quarter and our results for the full year, as well as provide additional insights into our 2017 outlook. Solid and as-expected Q4 results capped another record year of earnings as we exceeded the commitments we outlined for 2016. EBIT-adjusted was a record $12.5 billion, up $1.7 billion year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted margin was a record 7.5%, up 40 basis points year-over-year. Net revenue was a record $166.4 billion, up $14 billion year-over-year. Our strong results for the year were driven by record results in North America and GM Financial, sustained strong performance in China, and continued improvements in South America and Europe. And it was these strong results in 2016 and our outlook for 2017 that gave us confidence to announce the additional $5 billion in common stock repurchases. We are committed to returning all available free cash flow to shareholders with a focus on share buybacks. This is best reflected in our recent decision to maintain the current dividend per share and reallocate the released cash from a smaller share count to make additional share repurchases. Turning to the fourth quarter, we generated $43.9 billion in net revenue, $2.4 billion in EBIT-adjusted and delivered a $1.28 in earnings per share diluted adjusted. This is very much in line with our prior guidance. In North America, revenue was a record $119 billion for the year, up $12.4 billion year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted grew to a record $12 billion for the year, up $1 billion year-over-year. Our EBIT-adjusted margin was 10.1%, achieving our target of sustaining strong margins of 10% plus for the year. In fact, North America has now achieved 10% plus EBIT-adjusted margins for two straight years, and we expect to once again generate a 10% plus margin in North America in 2017. In Q4, North America generated $2.6 billion of EBIT-adjusted off a record $31.3 billion of revenue, down $200 million year-over-year. Volume and price were net positives, which were offset with costs, mix and FX. We continue to view the U.S. industry as healthy and supportive of our strong earnings outlook. The U.S. light vehicle industry finished the year with a 17.5 million units sold, and we continue to expect the industry to remain strong into 2017 and over the foreseeable future. We remain absolutely committed to our disciplined, retail focus go-to-market strategy, matching supply with demand, and being thoughtful about our sales to daily rental companies. This strategy is paying off through higher retail share, higher transaction prices and better residuals. Retail share for the full year was 16.8%, up 50 basis points versus 2015. We will continue to focus on retail share with additional planned reduction of daily rentals of approximately 30,000 units to 50,000 units in 2017. Moving to incentives and transaction prices; for 2016, we significantly outperformed our closest competitors on incentives as a percent of ATPs. GM incentives were up 80 basis points year-over-year, while the industry was up a 100 basis points year-over-year. Furthermore, GM's average transaction price has increased at a faster rate than the industry in 2016. Year-end day supply is well positioned at 71 days, in line with our target of 70 days. Looking ahead to Q1, we expect aggregate dealer inventory levels to remain higher than a year ago, as the industry remained strong and we built dealer stock ahead of our upcoming crossover launches. Having said that, we will continue to manage inventories with discipline and take the necessary actions as demonstrated by our recent shift reductions to match current production with demand. Okay. Moving on to the rest of the world, China continues to deliver solid results with equity income of $2 billion for the full year, about equal to a year ago. While we see slower growth in China for 2017, we are confident our new launches will improve our mix and enable us to continue to deliver strong equity income. After years of depressed conditions in South America, we're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel. We have worked hard at restructuring our business and lowering our breakeven point. Our efforts continue to payoff. The team narrowed losses by nearly $250 million this year compared to 2015 in a more challenging environment. We anticipate continued improvement in South America throughout 2017. Shifting to Europe. As Mary stated earlier, we're not satisfied with these results. Despite a $300 million impact from Brexit, we reduced losses by $550 million year-over-year, and would have achieved our breakeven objective absent Brexit. However, Brexit is a reality and we need to take renewed actions to get back on the path to a sustainable business and we will. Heading into 2017, we would expect relatively flat performance versus 2016 as we work to mitigate the Brexit impact. A few comments on GM Financial and our Corp segment. GM Financial posted record revenue of $9.6 billion and record earnings before tax adjusted of $900 million, up $100 million year-over-year. Earnings assets grew 36% to about $77 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth. We anticipate continued earnings before tax growth in 2017, as we execute the full captive strategy in the United States. In the Corp segment, costs were about $400 million for Q4, which resulted in costs of about $900 million for the year. The increased costs in the quarter were primarily related to our investments in autonomous and mobility. These costs will continue to be captured in the Corp sector. We expect a similar level of total quarterly corporate sector costs throughout 2017 as we saw in Q4. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, adjusted automotive free cash flow grew to $6.9 billion for the year, up $4.7 billion year-over-year. These results include increased capital spending of $1.7 billion, as we made investments in our portfolio, in line with our previously-communicated plan. Q4 adjusted automotive free cash flow grew by $2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by timing in working capital, including rental car activity and sales allowance accruals. We anticipate this effect to partially reverse in 2017. However, we still expect to generate approximately $6 billion in automotive free cash flow this year, consistent with the guidance we provided at the Deutsche Bank Conference. Our strong cash flow generation and earnings growth continues to support a significant return on capital to shareholders, in line with our capital allocation framework. We returned $4.8 billion to shareholders throughout the year, including $2.3 billion in common stock dividends and $2.5 billion in share repurchases, completing our initial $5 billion authorization one quarter early. In Q4, the company also completed the first $1 billion of the next $4 billion authorization. We expect to complete the remaining $3 billion in 2017. Last month, we announced the third share repurchase authorization of $5 billion to be completed as expeditiously as possible. The underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans improved by $3.2 billion in the year to $7.2 billion, due primarily to improved return on assets and contributions of $2.1 billion. Now I want to share more details on our 2017 outlook. As we outlined last month, we expect to deliver full-year 2017 EPS diluted adjusted of $6 to $6.50. Looking at the earnings cadence for 2017, for the full company, we expect the quarterly earnings to be more evenly distributed throughout the year than in the recent past with a slightly stronger Q1 and slightly weaker Q3 due to K2 production downtime. In North America, we expect to generate another year of 10% plus margins, primarily due to strong material cost performance and pricing driven by our new crossovers, partially offset by carryover pricing and increased content in our new launches. We see a significant opportunity for growth in adjacencies in 2017, specifically GM Financial, where we expect to once again improve earnings, as we continue to grow our U.S. captive capability. As we look around the world, we see an opportunity for improvement year-over-year in South America as the macro conditions improve, especially in our key market of Brazil, and we see continued strong profit performance in China. We expect these key drivers will lead to another strong year, maintain our improved EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margin and generate higher revenues compared to 2016. The company also expects to generate about $15 billion in automotive operating cash flow and $6 billion in automotive adjusted free cash flow. Lastly, I want to say a few words regarding recent news. We are supportive of efforts by President Trump and Congress to implement tax reform that improves the competitiveness of American companies. GM continues to share job creation ideas and industry information with lawmakers to help them create proposals that will be positive for the U.S. economy and keep vehicles affordable. Within the topic of tax reform, boarder adjustment tax is an area that has drawn the most attention and speculation. As you can appreciate, at this stage there is a significant uncertainty as to what proposals will actually be enacted and we expect to have more dialogue with you over time as details emerge. At this point, we can offer high-level insight into our assessment of the industry and GM's current sourcing picture. Our analysis shows the U.S. auto industry on average derives in the mid-50% range of its content from non-U.S. sources. Ours is lower. If current proposals are enacted, we expect to be less affected than some others. We're also taking a holistic view in considering other favorable elements of tax reform. For example, we would receive a benefit from our meaningful annual U.S. exports. Importantly, we expect our cash taxes to remain low over the next few years. We believe foreign-exchange, GDP growth and how costs and benefits are allocated through the supply chain are among the major variables that will ultimately dictate the economic outcome for GM and the industry. We'll continue to work with our government on tax reform measures that support U.S. manufacturing and the U.S. economy. So to sum it up, quarter in line with expectations, a record full year in 2016 and we will continue to meet our commitments in 2017 as we have done over the past three years. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a first question on the 2017 guidance, particularly in North America and when we think about this, the changeover costs for the crossovers is going to be met with some upside revenue because the product will actually launch. But when you look at the truck changeover on the actions you're taking in the second half of the year, getting real benefit on the revenue side is not going to occur until 2018, I'm just curious, if you can kind of delineate what level of pressure you're expecting from those truck changeover costs in the second half of the year, and really when you expect the benefit from the revenue to occur as we get into 2018? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, John. Good try to get me to answer when we're going to launch the next-generation truck. That's going to happen.... John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : What's coming? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. No doubt. What I would say, when I look at North American in total, again starting with the overall guidance, we expect another strong year of 10% plus margins in North America. The big drivers again with the puts and takes, volume and mix roughly are going to be flat. Volume will be down year-over-year, partially due to our taking action on passenger cars, and partially due to the ramp-up of the new crossovers and some of the changeover of the trucks, but mix will be favorable fundamentally offsetting that. Price will be favorable and costs will be favorable. Those two will largely or more than offset FX. Those are the biggest drivers in 2017 for North America. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, it sounds like the truck changeover costs are relatively low then in the second half, but are still a little bit of a headwind. Is that a fair characterization? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. I would say that as we're going through this launch cadence, whether it's trucks or crossovers or the vehicles that we launched this year or some of the impact in fourth quarter in North America related to Duramax, you always have some of those. I wouldn't say that they're materially different in 20 \u2013 the cost themselves in 2017 versus 2016, the bigger impact is on the volume side. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And then, secondly, I was just wondering if you could talk about your lease penetration in the fourth quarter and the full year in 2016. What generally sort of your marketing plans are between sort of lease subvention and marketing or incentive dollars in 2017 and what you're seeing in the industry, because it seems like there are some divergent views among the automakers, I'm just curious what you're seeing? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Lease penetration in 2016 in the fourth quarter was roughly 25%, 26%. That feels like the right number for us relative to overall penetration when you look at the makeup of our products whether luxury mix, truck mix and generally that would be running at an appropriate level from an industry perspective. With low interest rates, feels to me from an industry perspective that leasing is filling some of the gap on subvented financing and that's been running very low. So the biggest drivers are cash deals, and then leasing, and then standard \u2013 kind of standard payment term is very low subvented financing at this point. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly, I know this is kind of a tough question to answer at this point because we're not even sure what policy issues are going to be. Policy has got to actually settle in North America. But, Mary, in your discussion with Trump and the new administration, are you hearing anything about sort of a recognition that there could be sort of a response overseas, particularly in China, which is a very important market for you, sort of near-term and long-term, that might not be so great for your business. Is that being taken into the calculus as these decisions are being made or is this more just U.S. focused in the discussion so far? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think if you look at, there's a wide range of topics whether it's tax, trade, regulations and there's a lot of, I'll say, information being shared just to level the foundation. For instance, I've shared a lot of information about the dynamics in the auto industry and how all those things would be impacted. So, I would say, right now it's very constructive dialog and the administration really listening to the input that we have and to kind of put things in context. So that's where we're at right now, John. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Mary, I just got two questions for you. First on safety, Toyota has targeted a 100% of their vehicles sold in the U.S. to have active safety in AEB of some form as standard by the end of this year. That's their goal and sounds like they're on track to do that. When could we expect GM to make AEB standard on all of its vehicles to ensure the safest possible baseline technology available to all consumers regardless of their ability to spec up to the higher-trim levels? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, Adam, we're looking across the whole portfolio, we made the commitment with many other OEMs from a \u2013 it's a perspective for the emergency automatic braking. We're looking across and so we have the commitment made, we're looking across each of those product lines to look and see what we think is best from a customer perspective of what they are going to value, clearly it will be available, but giving the customers some choice there. So I don't have the specific rollout in front of me, but I know the team has worked across the entire portfolio across all brands to implement those plans. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Second question is more structural. Since your IPO, the S&P is up 95%, GM stock's up around 6%, I'm not trying to pick on you, because Ford stock's down over 20% from your IPO date in 2010. So there is clearly an OEM business model problem being discounted by the market and it does appear to go way beyond just GM. But look, your stock's really cheap and you admitted earlier in your comments, you think underappreciated by the market. Question is, is there something radical or structural like a change of business unit structure, legal organization structure like what Alphabet has done on the Google, something more radical that needs to be done to address the strategic concerns and risks discounted by investors or to otherwise unlock hidden value. I realize that's a very ethereal question and I ask it this way deliberately and respectfully just to see how you respond, Mary. Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Adam, so when we look at it, I kind of divide it into two pieces. One, we come to work every day looking to how do we drive shareholder value and long-term value for all of our shareholders. We believe and we've got a track record of demonstrating performance and meeting our commitments for three years now. We're going to continue to do that with our outlook for 2017. We've identified how we can continue to make this business better. I think we have more opportunity, but then also the way that we are investing in the future, which I think is huge opportunity with transportation-as-a-service, building on the platform for transportation-as-a-service is connectivity, we have a lead with OnStar and as we continue to roll that out very quickly around the globe and continue to not only provide that connectivity in each of our vehicles, but to build on what we can do with that connectivity, I believe we're just scratching the surface of what we can do with the data we have in the vehicle and continuing to add vehicle for customers. So, I think that's a huge opportunity. Clearly on electrification, we've got a lead with the Bolt EV having that vehicle in the marketplace, getting great reviews, it's not just a great electric vehicle, it's a great vehicle and that's the feedback we're getting from customers that gives us the foundation to really push forward in electrification and be very successful from an electrification perspective leveraging our global scale, so that's something that I think is a huge opportunity. Autonomous and transportation-as-a-service and sharing clearly the work that we're doing from an autonomous perspective and really looking from the traditional business to miles travelled, and how we can participate strongly. And that's why we've made the investments and have made great progress last year, really accelerated our progress on autonomous. And we released a video a week or two ago showing the progress and that progress is happening on a weekly basis, not monthly or quarterly. So, I look at how we're working to make sure we're as efficient as possible in the basic business of cars, trucks and crossovers around the globe, but then looking at all the opportunity that technology has to transform this industry. And I think we're well positioned. And that's what we're working hard on every day because I think that will change the dialog and change the calculus of how this company is valued. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on your comments on the potential for a border tax adjustment, could you frame the kind of cost increase you might expect if a border tax were implemented? And would you need to do any structural changes? I know some of your pickup capacity is down in Mexico; would you have to relocate it? I mean how are you sort of thinking about the planning if something actually does go through? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well. One, I think it's too early to speculate on the potential implications of the border adjusted tax. That's one part of tax reform, there's a number of moving pieces. And what we want to do is engage constructively around how we can best work with the administration to make sure that this is good for the economy, good for manufacturing footprint. As you can imagine, very, very complicated dynamic with supply footprint, manufacturing footprint, long lead investment, so a number of moving pieces here that we want to participate in and engage in around transition timing and other aspects of this. So again, too early to speculate on what the potential implications are. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : But do you think you're better at the position than the industry, what you said in your comments? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: When I look at the percent of import content, yes, we are better positioned than the industry on average. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And in your comments, I don't think I got this right, you said in the auto other line, the Q4 run rate of $400 million would continue, I think that implies around a $500 million year-over-year increase in other auto. One, is that correct? And then when we're thinking about adjusted EBIT being higher what are the main pieces that would offset that increase? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think you're thinking about it correctly. As we talked about the expenditures that we'll be making on autonomous vehicles will be in the corporate sector, as we look to start to provide more visibility around that, especially as we start to monetize that opportunity on a go-forward basis. And the puts and takes on that as you look at the overall results, I would expect aggregate profitability to be better in North America. I would expect profitability to better in South America, in GM Financial as well, and relatively flat in Europe, relatively flat in China. Those are the big drivers. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And just lastly, in your outlook, what is the raw material impact is that \u2013 how much of a headwind should be expect... Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: It is a headwind in 2017, I would say, in the low hundreds of millions of dollars at a corporate level at this point in time, not a significant magnitude, but certainly factored into our outlook. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just a follow-up on the last question. So, Chuck, I think you mentioned in 2017, North America cost should be favorable, if we tie that back into slide 16, is that sort of a fixed cost being favorable or is that the net of fixed as well as material carryover being favorable? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: The net of the two. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: The net of the two. Great. And then just as we think about the autonomous costs in 2017 and the fourth quarter, are there any metrics you can share in terms of by the end of year where you think you're going to be in terms of the size of your fleet, in terms of testing and other kind of metrics that we should be following as we track your progress? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yes. Not at this time, I think as the year unfolds, you'll hear more about that from us of what our plans are and some of those milestones that we'll be sharing. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And just lastly, I mean maybe for you Mary on the same topic, as you meet with the administration, I know there's a lot of discussion on tax and policy, what are your early thoughts on how the administration's looking at autonomous and future driverless cars and ride sharing, any initial thoughts on how they're approaching that element of it? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think we've had a very constructive and positive conversation about the regulatory environment and clearly putting safety at the forefront and doing the right thing for the environment. But looking at the opportunities of how do we streamline and how do we enable technology. So I think it's been a very positive dialog that has covered in a general sense autonomous. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hi, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a couple of questions. First, maybe for Mary, in your discussions in Washington about border adjustments, I'm wondering if there's been any discussion about a phase in of any changes at this point given the reality of the lead time required for any changes to the industrial footprint. And in addition to the border adjustments, do you see any potential changes to tariffs and your ability to bring in trucks without significant tariffs? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So in the conversation that I've done a lot, as have others recognizing we had an automotive industry focused meeting as well as the strategy and policy meeting, but to really make sure everyone is grounded and understands the complexity of our supply chain as well as the capital-intensive long lead nature of our business. And I think that understanding has been well received. Clearly, as Chuck said, there is a lot of moving pieces right now. We want to \u2013 and that's why we're at the table and also working at all levels of the administration to make sure we're providing the input because let's recognize the number of jobs that we do provide here 100,000 jobs. If you look at the number of vehicles that we sell here versus the number that is produced here, it's almost 80%. Now there is puts and takes with exports, but a very high percentage of products are built in this country. So we've been really providing all of those facts and then clearly talking about if there are shifts that they have to happen over time. So that's the input that we've given and I would say it's been very constructive. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And just two questions on the outlook for 2017. First, at a high-level, obviously you're expecting a little bit of improvement in North America, and flat China, you said that a few times, Chuck. And presumably you're taking into account the headwinds in North America, the non-recurrence of the inventory builds and pricing maybe on legacy products, raw materials, D&A, and in China, you talked about the 5% price deflation that you're expecting. A big offset to that is the cost savings that you're expecting, the $1.5 billion. I was hoping you can maybe give us a little bit more color on the price and mix benefit that you're anticipating from the new product, the magnitude of the pipeline that you're anticipating, and how that kind of plays a role in your bridge? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: In which sector would you like me to start, North America or China? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: North America and China. I guess whichever you want to do first. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. So, from a North American perspective, yes, we would expect aggregate profitability to improve year-over-year. As I indicated earlier, we expect volume to be a headwind and mix to fundamentally offset that, so the favorable mix associated with some of our recently launched products. Pricing will be favorable. Again related to our crossover launches, largely reduce sales allowances. And then, overall fix will be slightly favorable when you look at material on carryover versus fixed. Fixed costs are going to be relatively flat year-over-year. So, and that will offset some FX headwinds primarily related to the Mexican peso. So, those are the big drivers. In China, it's the same kind of dynamic that we've been talking about. Mix will be favorable, pricing will be \u2013 we're assuming another 5% headwind. Carryover material and mix will largely offset the pricing and cost. And cost should be slightly up in China as we get the full-year ramp of some of the recently-opened facilities, but the dynamics over the last couple of years aren't changing in China. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And just \u2013 that's really helpful. And just lastly in your outlook for GM Financial, how are you thinking about the impact of the higher borrowing costs and lower residuals in the forecast? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Factored in. I mean we factored in the expectations from a used \u2013 at least ALG and others expectations for what's happened with used car pricing. So, a continued normalization of used car pricing obviously we factor into our pricing and cost of funds expectations continuously rising interest. So, that's factored in. I mean going back to the conference we were at in January, we laid out all of the downsides and headwinds that we saw in 2017 and what we're doing to mitigate that in the context of our guidance. And the fact as you mentioned, we're part of that pricing dynamic, continued investment and new technologies, the pricing environment in the U.S. and China, for example, raw material headwinds in 2017 versus 2016. FX, from a global perspective, I mean that dynamics is not getting any better, but when you look at the things that were under our control, cost, our product launch cadence, which will improve mix and pricing. We again are confident that we're going to see strong results again in 2017. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. It's been asked a couple of times, Rod just asked it too. On leasing and residual values, how did your leasing percentage progress throughout the year? I think you said 26% for the fourth quarter. It sounds like you don't expect to see a slowdown in that or a pullback in leasing, as you're going into 2017. Part of that I imagine is because you're driving the higher prime business through GMF and expect to continue to keep that high. But really wanted to dig into what is the residual value forecast that you have going forward in your model for 2017 earnings? We've seen Ford and now Toyota take down the residual value forecast. Maybe they were just a little bit more aggressive on what residual values would look like before it had to come down. But trying to understand what you're baking in from a price decrease year-over-year for those vehicles? And then understandingly I know you're pulling back on daily rental, but that's only half the story. If you're continuing to drive lease penetration in the same rates that you are at some point in time, is there not going to be an increased supply of your vehicles coming off lease that could be detrimental to residual values in the 2018-2019 timeframe? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Just to try to answer those in the order that they came in, David. As we move through 2016 calendar year, our lease penetrations came down. Early, you may recall, earlier in the year first quarter, second quarter 2016, lease penetrations were up in the high 20s% and we moved them down to where we ended. As I said, mid-20% is the appropriate level and that's something that we would continue to manage. Relative to our lease residual exposure or our thinking of lease residual, I've covered this before vis-\u00e0-vis some of the competition, we've got a different mix because GM Financial has been leasing vehicles and been the captive lease provider only for the last couple of years. We have a significantly different mix, lower penetration of passenger cars, higher penetration of trucks and SUVs, and I'm not going to give you specifics on what we're assuming from used car. All I would say is, we're anticipating continued moderation and normalization of used car pricing, not inconsistent with third party type data that you could get out there over the next two to three years. I would say, in total, in the range of about 7% over the next two to three years, but I'm not going to give a year-to-year specific. And one of the fundamentals relative to how we're running the business residual modeling (45:34), we're working with GMF, our Express Drive 100% of our vehicles being remarketed by GMF is so that we can efficiently absorb and distribute in a way that is not detrimental to residuals the vehicles that are coming off lease. And that's one of the reasons we've significantly reduced our daily rental sales as well. So taking in balance, I think we've got a reasonably balanced view of what's going to happen from a residual perspective over the next number of years. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then taking your comments on GM pricing, obviously you expect it to be up in the back of product cadence. What are you anticipating for the overall market and how could that potentially change your view. I asked that because during this 3Q 2016 earnings call, I think we were talking about lower sequential incentives from 3Q 2016 to 4Q 2016. However from the data that we look at, it seemed as if GM incentives did go up sequentially in the fourth quarter, and that's partially being market driven. Given where you ended the January month with your days sales of inventory for passenger cars, as well as for light trucks, I mean, are you anticipating seeing the market continue to drive incentives higher. Obviously I think you guys pulled back a little bit in the quarter and that's why your sales were a little bit lower than where some of us expected. But just trying to understand where you see the overall market going from a pricing perspective, relative to your expectations where you have a product cadence that should be driving positive price? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. I would say the following, over the last number of years the pricing environment has been moderating. If you look at overall incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price, it's been inching up on a consistent basis, which is certainly not unexpected where we are in the cycle. We continue to be very disciplined, our actual incentive spend compared to the industry has come down back, three or four years ago we were running at 110% of industry, in the 2016 calendar year, we're closer to 103% or 104%. And I think that just highlights the strength of our product lineup. I would expect to see incentive spending inch up again in 2017. We said that we expected continued pricing challenges or competitive pricing environment in the United States and China. Within that though, when you look at our launch cadence, let's remember, in 2016 we had the oldest compact and mid-crossover lineup in the industry and still performed very well, that's going to be completely refreshed, which should provide an opportunity. Trucks continue to perform very well, demand is strong, we're running all of our plants on three shifts, full-on. So, supply and demand in balance. Where we have challenges is our cars and we're aligning supply and demand on that by cutting production. So, on balance, a more challenging pricing environment, but we think we're well positioned within that given our product launch cadence. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. It's very helpful. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman, JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just regarding the increase in corporate and eliminations expense in 4Q on autonomous investments, is that due to an actual acceleration in these autonomous investments or potentially to newly or increasingly accounting for them in the corporate and eliminations line or both, and then how should we think about these investments tracking going forward, roughly at the 4Q level or maybe something less? And then I imagine there is still no change right to the guidance that your cost cutting program over the next several years is expected to more than compensate for increased investments and all emerging technologies like electrification, mobility and autonomy such that net cost savings will be a net driver of higher EBIT going forward, is that right? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: The last point that is correct. To your first question, that Q4 I would say was run rate when we have ramped up the AV Engineering and Cruise Automation at roughly plus or minus $150 million a quarter. We weren't spending very much at all until we got into the fourth quarter and I would expect to see a run rate similar to that in 2017, roughly $150 million a quarter, that will we believe be sufficient because we've already got the architecture with the Bolt to put us in a strong position from an AV standpoint and when you look at the overall corporate sector you've get that year-over-year roughly $450 million increase plus there is some incremental legal expense in 2017 versus 2016 related to the ignition switch activities, and as I think about that beyond 2017 who knows, but that should start to moderate beyond that. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great, thanks. And then just my last question is on China. After the earnings there tracked very strong but the margin just a little softer. Is it still the case that the causal factors broken out in the GMIO EBIT bridge in slide 20 that those exclude non-consolidated operations with all of the change in equity income due to whatever causal factor in that other category? And then if so, can you speak directionally to the impact of volume mix, price cost in 4Q? And then, how you would expect these drivers to net out going forward? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So, the EBIT bridge is on a consolidated basis, so we exclude China. We report China equity income, the drivers of China equity income in 2016 similar to 2015, pretty similar volumes positive, mix is positive, pricing has been a 5% headwind, material cost performance has been a positive. And then as we ramped up plants, the fixed cost has inched up; net-net, in that dynamic we've been able to maintain the equity income, but you've seen the margin compression which we've talked about before on a go-forward basis, due primarily the pricing that the margins were going to compress and we saw that play out in 2016. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And how do you expect that to track maybe in 2017, these different drivers? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Sure. I think the drivers of the industry over there are very, very consistent, higher volume, better mix, pricing is going to be a headwind kind of in the same zip code in the 5% range, material cost efficiency will be a tailwind. And then, between their cost down, efficiency up and full run rate and the plant's fixed cost will be up slightly on a year-over-year basis, but generally consistent with what's been driving the business the last couple of years. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for squeezing me in here. Chuck, the first question is, in the fourth quarter, in North America, of the $1.2 billion in volume, how much of that was \u2013 if you could dimensionalize it from the stocking up, especially since I believe on a year-over-year basis and you know for the comp purposes in the fourth quarter 2015 you were still destocking? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, for the fourth quarter 2016 versus 2015, inventory build because you've got to look at the change and the change was about a 100,000 units and when I look at the net impact of that, about a $100 million, volume was up, but mix was unfavorable because a lot of that stock was building up stock of passenger vehicles, which we're now addressing. So that's kind of the impact in the fourth quarter. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, right. And you said volume a headwind for 2017, is it fair to assume you still have a little bit of stocking up and then it starts to tail off in terms of cadence. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Absolutely consistent with what we talked about back in December. We will be building inventories, we moved through kind of first half of the year. We'll be addressing the passenger car part of this with the shift reductions that we've announced. But we'll build inventory of our crossovers leading into the launch as well as trucks and then inventory will normalize in the second half, very similar to the dynamic we had when we transitioned from the GMT900 to the K2 and then we would expect to end 2017 in the same zip code as 2016, roughly 70 days' supply. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then on the autonomous and mobility cost not to beat the dead horse, but I mean you're bringing out in corporate. If you were to somehow allocate it by region, is most of that in North America? And then related, where are your electrification costs or how are those been allocated, are those also in corporate, or are those to the regions? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, the electrification costs depending on, they end up in the vehicles themselves and if it's engineering costs associated with electrification, it goes to the region fundamentally based on engineering resources deployed. The reason that we're separating autonomous is because we would expect over time, as we continue to move that business along with Maven forward into a commercial piece of the business that we want to make sure that there is visibility around that on the commercial side of autonomous vehicles, because we would expect to commercialize that obviously. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Are you willing to share how much in 2016 roughly you think you spent on electrification? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That would have been part of our overall engineering expense. So certainly a portion of the engineering expense, but I'm not going to break that out separately. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : And our final question today will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. A couple of quick questions. First, can you comment a bit, we beat the border adjustment tax to death, but prior to NAFTA there was a thing called a Chicken Tax, which my \u2013 maybe just could you comment on, my understanding is that still in effect and preventing imports of things like the Colorado and whatnot from Thailand. Would that also apply in the chance that NAFTA goes away to Mexico and if so have there been discussions given the importance of pickup truck lines to dare we say red states about whether that makes sense to apply to the pickup trucks coming up from Mexico? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: As it relates to trade overall or NAFTA, it is just really too soon to tell, but I mean I think, we've got a seat at the table and are providing input, because clearly we don't want to create a situation where we impact jobs in the United States, which will quickly happen when you look at how integrated the supply base is and how things go back and forth. So, it's really way too soon to speculate, what we're looking for is fare free trade, because we believe that with every country because we believe the strength of our product line will allow us to do well around the globe. So, in all the conversations we're making sure people understand possibly some not understood or aspects of the business, so a very informed decision can be made. As Chuck said, we do support overall tax reform, but the details are key and that's why we're having such an active voice in making sure the business is understood, the jobs we provide et cetera. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And second for Chuck more on a quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year level. When you look at the pricing majors minus material majors that was a net $200 million positive, your majors were mostly cars in 2016 and 2017 they are going to be CUVs. Do you expect that roughly $200 million a quarter pace to continue, could it expand or the other extreme is there payback as maybe some of the cars which seem to be driving some of the inventory position need to come out of the system? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I would expect that our pricing dynamic if you're speaking specifically in North America will be year-over-year on new will be a little bit more robust than the $200 million a quarter in 2016 based on the crossover launches. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. So, I just have a couple of quick closing comments here and I want to share a couple of key takeaways. First, the company is producing strong financial results and I think we've given you a lot of reasons and specifics of why we plan to continue to do just that in 2017 and realize stronger financial results. We believe overall, GM is a better and more disciplined and more focused company and you'll see us continue to drive that focus across all 220,000 employees around the globe, because we believe there are more efficiencies that we can deliver higher quality and continue with strong product as well as our investment in the future of mobility. All of this to drive strong shareholder value. We are taking the steps to make sure in the very important area of the future mobility that we have a leadership role and we're building on a strong foundation in many of these areas. And overall if you step back and look at 2016 as a whole, we're demonstrating that we can do what we say what we're going to do and continuing to build that track record of delivering on our commitments. So, we look forward to a very strong 2017 and I want to thank all of your for participating on the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Motors Company first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Friday, April 28, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Randy Arickx, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Randy Arickx - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us, as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we've got the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, General Motors' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide some brief opening remarks followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO, and then we will open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the legend regarding forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, to assist in answering your questions. Now, I will turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Randy, and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us. GM delivered a very strong quarter that set several Q1 records, including net revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, and EPS diluted-adjusted. Year-over-year results include net revenue of $41.2 billion, up from $37.3 billion; net income of $2.6 billion, up 34% from $2 billion; EBIT-adjusted of $3.4 billion, up from $2.7 billion; EBIT-adjusted margin of 8.2%, up from 7.1%; EPS diluted-adjusted of $1.70, up from $1.26; and EBIT-adjusted of $3.4 billion in North America and an EBIT-adjusted margin of 11.7%, both of those are Q1 records. Automotive-adjusted free cash flow of negative $600 million is an increase of $800 million. And our ROIC-adjusted was 29.7% on a trailing four-quarter basis, reflecting the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. And we returned about $600 million in dividends to shareholders in the quarter. Our strong core business continues to drive our earnings growth. The strategic investments we have made in brands and in our operations are delivering outstanding new products with higher quality, stronger ATPs and positive third-party recognition, and they were produced with much greater efficiency. In addition, we continue to generate outstanding EPS performance by focusing on key markets with leading franchises, relentlessly pursuing efficiencies across the enterprise and allocating capital to maximize returns and mitigate risk. This means taking action in difficult markets to either restructure or exit the business. As you know, last month, we announced the sale of our Opel and Vauxhall brands and GM Financial's European operations to PSA Group for about $2.2 billion. This transaction is a win for the stakeholders of General Motors, Opel/Vauxhall, and PSA Group because it will enable each company to capitalize on its respective strategic priority. For GM, the sale is another step in our ongoing work to transform the company by strengthening our core business, investing resources in higher return opportunities including the future of personal mobility, and returning significant capital to our shareholders. We expect the transaction to close later this year and immediately improve our EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins, and adjusted automotive free cash flow as well as de-risk our balance sheet. We can lower the capital balance requirement under our capital allocation framework by about $2 billion and use it to accelerate share repurchases, subject to market conditions. The sale will also allow GM to participate in the future success of PSA through warrants to purchase PSA shares and to collaborate with PSA in future technology development and deployment. Through these actions, we are establishing GM as a more focused company and aligning our business for strong, sustained performance and growth. If I turn and look at GMNA and GM China, they really drove our Q1 results. So, let's take a look. In the U.S., we have been introducing new and refreshed crossovers across our brands and we posted our best Q1 retail sales since 2008. Retail market share was up 0.3 percentage points to an estimated 16.9%. Chevrolet had its best first quarter since 2007 with year-over-year sales up nearly 2%. Buick and GMC retail sales, each were up nearly 4% with their best first quarter in 13 years. GMC sold its millionth top-of-the-line Denali model, which has contributed significantly to the brand's strong ATPs. Buick, once again, made Consumer Reports' list of top recommended brands. Crossover sales rose a combined 21% and truck deliveries were up 0.5%. Average transaction prices were over $34,000 and were in line with last year, and exceeded the industry by about $3,000. Now let's turn to China. I was just there last week for the Shanghai Auto Show and we actually had our GM board meeting there as well. We were there and participated in the launch of new models for the Buick and Baojun brands. In the quarter, GM China maintained strong equity income and margins, despite pricing pressures and a 5% sales decline in the quarter, partially due to an increased purchase tax. Record March retail sales by GM and its joint ventures were up 16% year over year and helped temper the slow start to the year. GM China launched four models in the quarter, the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback, the Chevrolet Camaro, the Baojun 510 SUV, and a new variant of the Buick GL8 MPV. Baojun and Cadillac achieved Q1 records, with deliveries up 25% and 90% year over year respectively. Half of the 18 new and refreshed models that we introduce in China this year will be in the higher margin SUV, MPV, and luxury segments. GM continues to expand its electrification portfolio in China with plans to introduce more than 10 new energy vehicles between 2016 and 2020, including hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles. GM in China launched the Cadillac CT6 PHEV late last year and last week launched the Buick Velite 5 extended-range EV. In addition, Buick will introduce, at least, one all-new locally produced battery electric vehicle model before the end of the decade. In South America, we expect significant year-over-year improvement in 2017, despite initial industry weakness. Chevrolet continued its 16 years of leadership in the region with sales growth of nearly 11%, outpacing the industry and market share of 15.7%. Losses were unchanged year over year and we remain confident that we are well positioned for growth when the market fully recovers. In Brazil, Chevrolet has maintained its market share lead for 18 consecutive months. In our ongoing work to lead in the future of personal mobility, we are making progress in autonomous vehicles, electrification, and connectivity. We just announced we will invest $14 million in a new research and development facility in San Francisco, where Cruise Automation will expand development of self-driving vehicle technologies. Cruise will hire more than 1,100 employees during the next five years and link them with our global engineering talent across the globe. We are running our autonomous vehicle program like a startup to give us the speed that we need to stay focused at the forefront of these technologies and the market applications. As autonomous car technology matures, our talent needs will increase, and Cruise's presence in the Bay Area gives us access to a world-class talent pool. These are men and women who want to be part of a fast-moving technology company that can also manufacture autonomous vehicles in scale. This month we announced Super Cruise. This is the industry's first true hands-free highway driving technology. It will be available later this year on the 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan. Super Cruise is the first assisted driving technology that will use precision LiDAR map data in addition to real-time cameras, sensors, and GPS. When engaged, Super Cruise accelerates, brakes, steers, and keeps the car centered in the lane, even in stop-and-go traffic. And a camera-based driver attention system exclusive to Cadillac ensures drivers keep their eyes on the road. Super Cruise is a very promising technology that lays the groundwork for a safer future. On electrification, we are maintaining our industry lead in reducing battery cell costs, key to bringing affordable electric vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt EV to market. We are ahead of the impressive battery cell projection cost we established two years ago, and our internal focus is to make GM the first maker of profitable, highly desirable, range-leading, and obtainable electric transportation. Advancing our lead in vehicle connectivity, in March we became the first mass-market automaker to offer an unlimited data plan. Since then, we have sold more than 100,000 unlimited data plans across our four U.S. brands. GM has more than 5 million OnStar 4G LTE-connected vehicles on the road today, more than any other automaker. Now if we look at the calendar year 2017, given the used car pricing, a softer than expected industry in South America, a more challenging pricing environment in the U.S. and China, and more pressure on commodity costs, there is absolutely no question the global environment is feeling tougher. Having said that, this management team is focused on taking the actions necessary to deliver the commitments we made in January, including EPS diluted adjusted of $6.00 to $6.50, and EBIT-adjusted margins greater than or equal to 2016. Our pipeline and mix of new products are strong. In the U.S., 10 all-new or recently redesigned crossovers are expected to drive sales and market share higher this year. At the same time, we continue to adjust passenger car output to meet consumer demand. We'll realize full-year sales of popular crossovers like the Cadillac XT5, the GMC Acadia, the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the Buick Envision, and a refreshed Buick Encore launched in 2016. They'll be joined this year by the next-gen Chevrolet Equinox and Traverse and the GMC Terrain, Buick Enclave, and the all-new Regal Tour X crossover wagon. Our intense focus on cost efficiency continued. In January, we increased our savings target to, at least $6.5 billion through 2018, which we expect will more than offset incremental investments in engineering, brand building, and technology. And we are always seeking additional opportunities to streamline the business and identify further savings. Our solid quarter follows three years of record-setting performance and a track record of taking bold and decisive actions to execute our strategic plan, put the customers at the center of everything we do, and deliver shareholder value. And, with that, I'll turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. As we expected, we had a very strong start to the year, generating first quarter records for revenue, EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, and EPS diluted-adjusted. In North America, we once again had a record first quarter for revenue, EBIT-adjusted, and EBIT-adjusted margins. Revenue increased 11% to $29.3 billion, up from $26.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016. EBIT-adjusted of $3.4 billion was up over $1.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2016, which included $200 million in restructuring expense. EBIT-adjusted margin was 11.7% for the quarter, up 3 percentage points year over year through improved pricing and reduced cost. The first quarter was driven by strong carryover pricing, primarily on our pickup trucks, as well as the aforementioned cost performance. While our majors were not a significant source of EBIT improvement in Q1, as the majority of the launches last year were in challenging car segments, we see our crossover launches driving favorable price performance throughout the balance of the year. As we have said, our crossover launches are significant opportunities for the company. Our lineup will go from arguably the oldest to the newest portfolio in the industry, as we launch the Chevy Equinox and Traverse, the GMC Terrain and the recently unveiled Buick Enclave in 2017, following on the Cadillac XT5, Buick Envision, and the GMC Acadia in 2016. Shifting to inventory, as I said during the January DB conference and in our recent Office Hours webcast, we expect to build inventory in the first half of the year, which will then decline in the second half, very much driven by product launch cadence and scheduled K2XX downtime. And through the first trimester of the year, we are very much on plan. Admittedly, passenger car inventory remains heavy and we have been working to bring that down to more appropriate levels by cutting production, and we remain committed to match supply and demand. We expect to end 2017 with inventory in line with 2016 at about 70 days' supply, with significantly reduced passenger car levels. Our expectation is that the industry SAAR [Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate] will remain in the mid-17 million-unit range, and we are on plan for a third straight year of 10-plus percent EBIT margins in North America. Shifting to Europe, revenue was $4.5 billion, down $200 million year over year, primarily due to foreign exchange rates. EBIT-adjusted was a loss of $200 million, driven primarily by foreign exchange due to Brexit. This compares to breakeven for the first quarter of 2016. As Mary mentioned, we see significant opportunity from the exit of GM Europe, which will immediately improve our overall EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins. In addition, we have been spending approximately $1 billion a year in CapEx in Europe. We would expect this to be fully recaptured and create about $1 billion annual improvement in adjusted automotive free cash flow, all else equal. Once we satisfy various legal and regulatory conditions to close, we will report our Opel/Vauxhall business and GMF European operations as discontinued operations, potentially starting as early as the second quarter. Moving on to China, China had another strong quarter with equity income of $500 million, about equal to a year ago. Wholesale volume in the first quarter was essentially flat versus the first quarter of 2016. We continue to see pricing pressure, which was offset by improved mix with stronger Cadillac volumes and Baojun launch vehicles, as well as continued cost efficiencies. The industry was down roughly 3% in the quarter due to the partial expiration of the government's purchase tax incentive. However, there is strength in luxury, SUV and crossover segments where we are well positioned. Despite the slow start, we still expect low single-digit industry growth in 2017 in total. Given continued growth expectations, our strong launch cadence, continued mix improvement and cost efficiencies, we expect another year of strong equity income in China. Turning to South America, revenue for the quarter was $2 billion, an increase of about $600 million year over year. Our EBIT-adjusted loss was $100 million, essentially flat versus a year ago. The macro environment in Brazil was not as strong to start 2017 as we had expected, as the industry was down 2% in the first quarter. In spite of that, GM volume in Brazil was up to 8%, resulting in a market share increase of 1.5 percentage points. We started to see some positive signs for the industry in Brazil in March, and we still expect year-over-year profit improvement overall in South America. A few words on GM Financial, the corporate sector and free cash flow. GM Financial generated a quarterly record revenue of $2.9 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2016, resulting in record earnings before taxes of $300 million, up about 16% year over year despite the pressure we've seen in used-car values. We estimate the 7% decline seen in recent months will continue through the rest of 2017. Obviously, used-car pricing impacts us in many ways, including pressuring our residual values, increasing the cost of leases for our customers, and reducing off-rental auction pricing. This is why we have put such an emphasis on strengthening our brands and reducing our reliance on rental car sales. And while a decline in used-car pricing puts pressure on GMF, we still expect GMF and our other adjacent businesses to be tailwinds for the full year versus 2016. Corporate costs were $300 million, up $100 million year over year, as expected. As we previously indicated, corporate costs will remain higher throughout the year, as autonomous and mobility investments are included in this segment. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was a seasonally expected burn of $600 million for the first quarter. This is an improvement of $800 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The improvement was driven primarily by improved automotive EBIT-adjusted. With regard to our total company outlook for the full year, Q1 was strong. In fact, it was our strongest Q1 in history and very consistent with our expectations entering the year. This strong start puts us very much on plan for full year profit margin equal to or better than 2016. We're also on track to generate approximately $6 billion of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the full year. While we were restricted from repurchasing shares in the first quarter, due primarily to the pending GME transaction, we expect to execute up to $5 billion of share repurchases, pending the close of the GME sale and resulting reduction of $2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. These repurchases are expected to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our first quarter was a strong start to the year we expected and puts us on track to achieve our EPS-adjusted guidance of $6 to $6.50 for the full year. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Our first question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Hi, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Can you hear me? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: A couple of questions just focused on North America. The pricing is very impressive especially relative to the market and, I guess, I'm wondering of what your view is on, at what point the $1,100 to $1,200 per vehicle decline in auction values actually starts to become a headwind for affordability and mix and start to affect new vehicle pricing for you. And then also on North America, that fixed cost savings number of $300 million in the quarter, can you give us some idea of what the net opportunity for fixed cost reduction might be this year or next? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, clearly in the first quarter, speaking about the pricing, that was largely related to truck pricing on carryover trucks and that was a number of pricing actions that we took last year. So, I wouldn't expect to see that kind of run rate through the rest of the year on carryover pricing, Rod. With that said though, we do expect, as we've talked about before, overall pricing to be favorable for the year as we launch our new crossovers and that's going to drive obviously in that tailwind through the balance of the year. Relative to impact of used-car pricing on affordability and everything else, obviously, that's one driver of affordability, continued availability of low-cost interest is another driver, continued low gas prices is another. Clearly, that's something on our radar and something that we're very focused on and that's why we're intensely focused on driving cost efficiency, because the market's just going to become more competitive as we go forward. Again with that said, we're very constructive and optimistic and confident around our 10% margin objective for the year. On the cost front, if you look at North America in the quarter, we had $700 million year-over-year improvement in cost, $200 million of that was absence of restructuring charges. You may recall we took the SAP, the attrition program last year in Q1 as part of the 2015 UAW negotiation. So, kind of recurring was the $0.5 billion of savings in the first quarter and that $300 million was really absence of launch cost, because we were relatively light. I would expect that to amp up as we go through the rest of the year. Both from a manufacturing and a marketing perspective, we've got a heavy launch cadence. With that said and looking at total cost, from a fixed cost perspective, material cost performance, warranty, our overall cost, we expect cost performance to be a favorable tailwind year over year, something north of $1 billion. And again, as we've talked about repeatedly, we are very, very focused on driving cost efficiencies and it's starting to show up in our results from a North American perspective. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you, and just one last one, you're achieving this performance in North America, despite some pretty significant drags, obviously, still from passenger car, and it's very apparent when you see the contribution margins in the K. Could you give us a sense of the range of options that you're contemplating for that business, and is there a very sizable opportunity still left in improving the performance in North America through reconfiguring that or coming up with some creative solutions for that business? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: When you say that business, Rod, are you referring to passenger cars? I wasn't sure of your question. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Correct. Obviously, more than 100% of your earnings in North America is coming from the trucks. So, there's obviously a significant drag here, and there are a lot of options for that business each short term and long term, but how are you thinking about the range of alternatives? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah. First, I would say, if you look at the cars, the Cruze, the Malibu, specifically that we just launched last year, they are on very efficient architectures; architectures that we'll use for multiple generations, not only from a light-weighting efficiency from a performance perspective, but also efficiency from a cost perspective. So, that's one opportunity that we're already putting in place \u2013 or we've already put in place. The brand building that we're doing is very important, also looking at the material cost performance that we continue to drive, and then really looking at configuring the vehicle and making sure we have the right vehicle offering to best satisfy and create the value for the customer. There's also opportunities with OnStar and the performance and what we can drive into the vehicle there. So, there's several things that we're looking at and that we continue to work on as we continue to improve the profitability of cars. So, we're very focused on doing that and are making good progress. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: If I could just add a couple of points to what Mary said, Rod, number one, we certainly, as Mary said, see opportunities to drive improvement in profitability in cars and it's like a key focus area for us here in North America. But the cars that we just recently launched are more profitable than the vehicles they replaced. And we continue to make progress from that perspective. Secondly, and I think speaking more broadly about passenger cars globally and not just North America, our execution of our global emerging market program which will fundamentally replace emerging market architectures, 11 or 12 separate architectures with one. Engineered and co-sourced in China with 2 million units of scale is going to drive huge benefit in passenger car profitability at a company level. And just to give you a data point, 90% of South America's volume will come off the GEM architecture once it's rolled out, which is a huge opportunity from that perspective. So, very, very focused, big opportunity for us. We continue to make progress in North America, more to do and I think the global emerging market program that we'll be starting to launch in 2019 is going to be another significant enabler to improve our quality of earnings. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So just first maybe for Chuck on the 2017 outlook, when we think about the strong result and some of the industry headwinds you've mentioned, is there any kind of early bias around kind of high end, low end of the range? And then also kind of how we think about the cadence of earnings in the remaining three quarters of the year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Let me answer the cadence part first because this is consistent with what we've talked about, again going back to January and then in the Office Hours, we would expect earnings \u2013 unlike typical years, you guys know Q1 is relatively weak, Q4 is relatively weak, Q2 and Q3 relatively stronger. We would expect this year, kind of a more evenly cadence level of earnings generally. Q1, obviously, stronger than typical and Q3 is going to be weaker than normal and that's because of the significant downtime that we're having related to launch products. We've got somewhere in the ZIP code of 13 weeks of downtime in Q3, a little more than half of that's related to full-size pickups and SUVs getting ready for the next-generation launch. There was some crossover downtime as well as Bowling Green for Corvette. So, I think from a cadence perspective, in North America we'll drive this largely, Q3 would be relatively weak compared to the past years, from an overall cadence perspective. What was the first part of your question? Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just in terms of any bias around the low end, high end of the range? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I think we're very confident in the guidance that we provided of $6 to $6.50 for the year. And Mary just indicated in her remarks that, we expect revenue to be up and EBIT and EBIT-adjusted to be greater than or equal to 2016. So, we fundamentally haven't changed our view. And again, the comment that I made, we expected a strong Q1, we delivered a strong Q1 and that's consistent with the guidance that we provided earlier in the year. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. And then just secondly, maybe kind of a long-term strategic question. In the past, you'd talked about targeting first to scale with autonomous ride-share services, you've also recently talked about profitable electric vehicles. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about that in terms of what the timing is for the two goals and how you benchmark GM relative to some of your peers and competitors out there. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: First to talk about autonomous vehicle, we continue to make very strong progress with Cruise Automation. We've given the Cruise Automation team with the right resources that we've added, responsibility not only developed from a technology perspective and integrate with the core engineering elements of General Motors, but also the commercialization. And so we really are running that as a startup. We haven't put specific timing out there, but I think what we've said several times it will be sooner I think than most people think and we're aggressively working on that and you'll hear more from us as the year evolves on that. So I'm very pleased with the progress we're making. And also, I think one of the key things, there's a lot that is said right now about autonomous vehicle development. But when we are doing our development in downtown San Francisco, also in Scottsdale, also now in Detroit, downtown San Francisco is one of the most complex environments, and the progress that we're making with zero incidents as we take many routes around that city I think gives me confidence that we're on a very good path. As it relates to electrification, when I look at all the assets that we bring to electrification, and this is why Mark has challenged the team, that we are the first OEM that is profitable in electric vehicles again from a technology, from a performance, and from an affordability perspective. And I think we have a steady ramp of products that you're going to see over the next couple years in electrification, but as we continue to evolve our BEV architecture, I think that will be the step. We are ahead of the curve on our cell costs. We started at \u2013 just a couple years ago we were at $145. We're now below our curve as we get to our goal of being under $100. And so that is progressing very well. The experience that we're seeing with the Chevrolet Bolt EV and the great response we're getting, because that is a car that is not only an electric vehicle, but it's fun to drive and it's really a technology platform. So when I look at what we've already got into the marketplace with our leadership position in the actual cell technology and the scale that we can leverage across the globe, specifically China, which will be the first and we believe largest electric vehicle market, I think that well positions us. So I'm not going to give you specific timing on either, but autonomous sooner than you think. And on electrification, that will really as we continue to evolve the BEV architecture. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful, Mary. Thanks so much, that's all I had. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks. Congrats on the strong quarter, by the way. Just a couple questions on international operations. First on China, you showed an interesting chart at the Detroit show that illustrated your average wholesale price has been steadily rising there in recent years despite the increase in discounting. Mary mentioned in her remarks Cadillac was up 90% in 1Q. So, can you maybe give us an update in terms of how your average prices are trending, how you expect them to trend in 2017? What's going on especially in the period after the purchase tax there stepped up from 5% to 7.5% in terms of discounts, peer pricing in light of those discounts, and then your actual average prices which also take into account mix? I think that can be very helpful for investors forecasting profits for the remainder of the year in China. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: A number of questions buried in there, Ryan, so I'll try to address them all. As we did show in Detroit, as mix continues to improve, and it's driven in both channels, both through SGMW and SGM, SGMW because they launched the Baojun brand with a number of crossovers, which obviously generate better price than the very small commercial vehicles. And on the SGM side with the growth of Cadillac and the launch of crossovers, we saw that increase in average revenue per unit, and we'll continue to see that on a go-forward basis. If you look at Q1 results, we had equity income that was fundamentally flat year over year, our net income margins down slightly from 9.7% to 9.3%. and what we're seeing play out is very significant improvements in mix that's fundamentally offsetting carryover price headwinds and improvement in carryover material cost that's fundamentally offsetting fixed cost increases as we've started to run more of our plants on a full line and fully utilized basis over there. And I would expect as I think about the rest of the year for that trend to continue, as it has over the last couple years because the Cadillac brand will continue to get new portfolio entries. Luxury is running strong. We've got a number of crossovers that we'll be launching over the next period of years, this year and next year, at both SGM and SGMW. So that's a trend we would expect to continue to play out. Relative to the industry, obviously there was a pull ahead into last year, as customers expected a pullback on the purchase tax. Payback in the first quarter, the industry was down 3%. We would expect to see the industry grow, as I mentioned, in low single-digit margins and some of that could be back-end loaded because I think there will be another reaction as customers expect a full pullback on the purchase tax by the end of this year, but that's our expectation. As we entered the year, we anticipated that carryover pricing was going to be negative 4.5% to 5%. I'd say through the first trimester, it's been a little bit north of 5% at SGM. However, again the results speak for themselves. We've been able to offset that with improved mix and cost performance at SGM and SGMW. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, that's very helpful. And then just lastly for me, I'd like to probe a little bit on the consolidated side of IO. It looks like the losses there grew year over year to $184 million, despite you're having taken some aggressive actions to try to right-size the operations and more selectively compete. Can you walk us through the actions that you have announced to date and the degree to which the associated savings are or are not already reflected in the results that we see? So for example, like Australia manufacturing, I think that still hasn't wound down, so maybe some more tailwind. The actions that you've announced in Thailand and Indonesia, are those savings reflected in the 1Q numbers? And then just beyond what you've already announced, even as some of the savings still are to come, is it fair to say that the remaining savings would not be quite enough to get you to profitability there? And if that's so, then what additional levers remain to be pulled like in India or Korea? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Let me talk to the Q1 results for a second. Clearly, we're running against a challenging environment, specifically in the Middle East. The biggest driver of the year-over-year deterioration in GMI more than accounting for the year-over-year deterioration is a contraction of the Middle East industry given low oil prices and we saw reasonably profitable vehicles there. So, that's the big driver. You're right, the impact of Australia, we won't start to see that until we exit 2017 and get into 2018. When we fully wind down manufacturing, that will be kind of we'll cease production in October timeframe there. So, that's something we'll see run rated in 2018. The Thailand downsizing of passenger car profitability and Indonesia ceasing manufacturing, clearly those savings are included, but in the big scheme of things, not necessarily a big driver. I mean, it's tens of and twenties of millions of dollars, not hundreds of millions of dollars. I would suggest when you look at the rest of the region, the best thing I can say is stay tuned. We continue to evaluate our operations there, and I think the lens to look at that is, if we can't find a path to a sustained long-term return in markets, we will take decisive action and that's something that we continue to evaluate and, again, I would suggest stay tuned. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, that color was helpful. Congrats again on the quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Oh, great. Thanks for taking our questions this morning. Chuck, I just want to understand the first one for me in North America, as we think about the movement into 2Q and 3Q for your inventory levels and into 4Q, are we at the right levels at the end of March, the last data point that we saw? Should we see levels come up even further heading into the end of the second quarter, should they be coming down? And I ask this because I think overall, at the end of March, it was about 98 days, 108 for pickups, 89 for SUVs and 101 for passenger cars. Should we see passenger cars start to come down throughout the second quarter, SUVs drift up and maybe pickup trucks coming down? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: The way I would think about it generally is, our expectation \u2013 again, this is a bit of a forecast because it depends on the strength of the industry and everything else as we go through Q2. But our expectation is that the overall level will be at a roughly 90-day supply at the end of Q2 roughly. Passenger cars will be down significantly, will still be at somewhat elevated levels on trucks and crossovers because of the downtime that I talked about before in Q3. And what we're driving to as we get to the end of Q4, as we've discussed before, is overall inventory on a days supply basis generally in line with 2016, roughly 70 days and our kind of objective is cars at about 50 days when we exit the year and obviously trucks will be a little bit more than 70 and crossovers will be kind of in that ZIP code, because we typically carry more than 70 days of trucks. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you. And then just following up on that, the China pricing discussion, I mean, it sounds like it was a little bit worse than you had expected in the first quarter, obviously, did a very good job of outperforming that on the cost side. But as we progress through April, are we seeing a sequential acceleration in that negative pricing environment, given at least, I think, the industry inventory levels are a little bit elevated year over year or have you seen kind of a steady state in that 5-plus percent range, but not accelerating the negative 6%, negative 7% pricing headwind. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: It's been relatively steady through April so far. Not a surprise is the industry contracted and it's a very competitive environment and people were \u2013 competitors were being very aggressive from a pricing perspective, it's kind of just steady as she goes in April. Our expectation though is, we work our way through the rest of the years, this should moderate a bit, but that's not our baseline planning assumption. We're planning around and driving the business around something in the mid-5% range from a year-over-over carryover pricing. But it should moderate as we start to see growth again because just naturally, it might take some pressure off the supply and inventory dynamic that we saw in the first quarter. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. And just last one from our end. As I think about, you're a couple of months into now the Chevy Bolt launch, you've been manufacturing this vehicle. When you compare that to maybe some of the other passenger car launches, how much easier it is really to manufacture that vehicle, that pure electric vehicle versus your internal-combustion engine portfolio? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: From a componentry perspective, to your point, it is a bit simpler to put together. It is in one of our very efficient plants, the Lake Orion plant in Michigan. And so, when we look at the launch, it's on track, we're currently selling in eight states, California, Oregon, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Washington. We'll have some remaining northeastern states that will launch in May and then later in the year available across the United States. So, we're right on plan with where we expect the Bolt EV and also important that it will have some global launches as well. So, again it's in one of our most efficient plants. It's been engineered to be very efficient to build, so we're right on track and we're pleased with the progress on the vehicle. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you both very much for the time. I appreciate it. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good morning. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : I just wanted to follow up sort of on the cost question. I mean, I think there are some people out there that still fear that you guys are sitting in the sort of the hypothetical downturn war room and you press the big red button, it says pricing and incentives on it. But I just wonder if you could sort of remind us and sort of talk about the other levers that you would pull along before you would ever push that button to really address sort of what might be some decremental margins and what kind of cost cutting you would do at least temporarily to offset the volume downturn. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So, assuming there's a volume downturn, right, because this is still... John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : I said, hypothetical, yes. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hypothetical. So, clearly and first, again, I like to start these things at 10,000 feet and work my way down. We are very cognizant of that we operate in a cyclical industry, and we're eight years into expansion and it's not like we're sitting and waiting for a downturn to be prepared. I mean, day-to-day we are very focused on acting like we're in a downturn from a cost performance perspective and really taking a hard look at cost. With that said, if there was an event-driven downturn, immediate opportunity is to reduce costs, obviously, marketing. Marketing costs are a significant \u2013 I view it as significantly variable, right, depending on where the industry's at. And you could scratch out of that pretty easily something north of $1 billion. As we've talked about before, our manufacturing cost is much more variable now, and I think perhaps people still have the mental model of pre-bankruptcy where, as you took volume out, the manufacturing cost was very sticky. That's not the case now. We've got roughly 30% of our workforce that is short term that would not carry an unemployment benefit. And as we go through the next couple of years, that's going to increase to 50%. Clearly, as we see a downturn, there is a component, I hate to even bring it up, but incentive comp and profit sharing, that's a significant opportunity for reduced cost, it doesn't make any of us happy, but that's a fact. And we are continuing to look at opportunities through operational excellence, Global Business Services to drive savings in GBS. And one point related to this, we've talked about the sale of Opel/Vauxhall to PSA. We are engaged right now in an enterprise initiative to look at how this simplification of the business will allow us to take significant structure out of the business, whether it's corporate staff, whether it's engineering, because the portfolio is going to be more simplified, really across the business and we think that's going to generate significant cost savings. I would say, again stay tuned as we work through that. We will communicate it and likely it will have an upward impact on our $6.5 billion target. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Absolutely. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : That's very helpful. Then just a second question, obviously, there's a lot of pressure on leasing right now or there's a lot of push on leasing to sell vehicles. And one of the big challenges, I think, the dealers are having is, a lease payment is a lot cheaper than a six-year loan payment. So, the consumer is gravitating to that, not recognizing some of the back-end cost. Just curious as you look at leasing, what kind of other instruments are you passing along to your dealers through GMF to help deal with this, because I think the dealers are kind of struggling with this. I mean, it seems like \u2013 it sounds like the automakers are pushing it, but the consumer is pulling it in a huge way and it's creating this, sort of this lease bubble. I'm just curious what you're doing with GM Financial and your dealers to help get cars sold via loan as opposed to lease? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I mean there's a number of different drivers, obviously, and I agree with you, with low interest rates kind of the subvented financing is not as effective as it would be with normalized interest rates. And that's what's kind of driven a few folks over to leasing to chase that monthly payment. We work very, very closely and collaboratively with GMF to try to optimize across our overall incentive spend and mitigate the growth of leasing and mitigate our exposure there. And one thing, a specific tactic is down payment assistance on APR, instead of allocating the money to leases, we allocate the money to provide down payment assistance. That's had a significant impact in a relatively short term in driving more standard APR business to GMF. So, it's those kinds of tactics that we deploy. And we look across all of the tactics, whether it's leasing, whether it's our subvented financing, cash offers, down payment assistance, loyalty offers, I mean there's a number of tools in the toolbox and it's really to optimize kind of the overall mix of sales on spending and not create imbalances as we go to market. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, just one last question. I mean there's some companies out there that are pure electric car manufacturers that are basically raising no cost capital right now, which is difficult to compete against, I mean not so difficult for you right now, because volumes are incredibly low with those companies. But when you think about potentially separating pieces of the company, Mary, is there a potential to do that, not just to necessarily unlock value for shareholders, but to get access \u2013 what this is \u2013 the sort of a seemingly voracious demand for this growth in the new car future that's being given no cost capital, so that you could get some access to that cheap capital as well? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: We constantly evaluate that and I think the steps that we took at the beginning of the year with what you see, we're doing in autonomous, are leading in that direction. So, we're looking to create the right business model, demonstrate \u2013 we're in a little different position with how we come at this and just to get to the core business and some of the \u2013 just a different perspective that people have on this company. But that's why we are being so aggressive in autonomous, so aggressive in electrification. And frankly aggressive with leveraging our 20-year lead with OnStar and having connectively in the car and unlocking the data monetization opportunities as well as just leveraging the data to provide a distinct and better value to the customers, so they buy our vehicles. So we continue to evaluate that. We want to put a few more I'll say proof points on the board and demonstrate that we are, I believe, best positioned, especially in electrification when you look at our track record, our scale, the leverage that we have across the globe. So we're going to continue to push on that. And as we evaluate, we'll look at the right time to make sure that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, of which is having the right availability of capital. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, everybody. Hi, Mary. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Hello. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: It's incredible. It's been already three years since \u2013 or more than three years since you got the CEO role. And I think you've probably done more in three years than a lot of other CEOs have done in 30. That's been a real whirlwind. And so please accept this question in the way it's intended. But there's been \u2013 I just want to know if you care to comment on some of the press speculation that as President Trump looks to bring in some expertise, including expertise from industry, to help him with strategy and infrastructure and transportation that your name has come up very high, if not at the top of the list. Just any, do you care to comment on that? Again, I'm not suggesting that your services aren't incredibly valuable in your current seat, but just it is a relevant topic for transition. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Adam, thanks for your comments, and I am 150% committed to General Motors. In my 37-year career, this is an incredibly exciting time because not only do I believe we are putting the best vehicles on the road that we have in my career here, but when I look at the opportunities that we have with autonomous, with electrification, with connectivity, I'm very passionate about it. And so I'm 150% dedicated to this company and continuing to demonstrate that General Motors can be the industry leader in transforming transportation and also being very responsive to the environment, and I think we're well positioned to do that. So that's where my focus is and will be going forward. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, Mary. That's very clear. Just my follow-up question, second question, China, I believe you're still number one in that market in terms of the broadest definition of light vehicle sales in China. Now in a market where U.S. tech firms like Google and Facebook are not legal in China due to data privacy issues, thinking on your business as your cars become pretty quickly data capturing, HD mapping machines, collecting passenger information and making life-and-death AI decisions, do you see any risk, Mary, however long term to your ability to continue to position, to maintain that position in a Chinese future mobility model with the obvious data privacy issues which that regime might naturally feel sensitive about from an economic or national security perspective? Thanks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So you bring up a very good point, one that we're very cognizant of, and so we look at what the landscape is. We do have OnStar deployed quite successfully in China right now. But we also think there are opportunities that we're exploring of how we work in that whole ecosystem because it is a very different ecosystem, not only because of some of the issues that you've raised and the different companies that really are leading in that market, but also because of where the country is and how they're adopting technology and in some cases skipping whole generations of the way developed markets use the technology in going right to an end game solution. So when I was there just last week, we spent quite a bit of time on that topic and developing the plan of how we're going to pursue that, very specific to the Chinese market, that environment, and the potential people we might work with there as we continue to evolve the OnStar platform in that country. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And, Mary, you currently have full access to all consumer data from OnStar in China? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Through our SGM. Yes, SGM has that. The way we view data, Adam, is that the customer owns it. And so if someone signs up for this service, they give us permission to how we're going to use that data. So again, complying with all the laws and regulations in each of the countries, that's the way we use it. But through our joint venture, SGM, we do have access to that data, as we set it up with permission from the customer. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, Mary. Take care. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on one of the initial questions on the mix and pricing in North America. And I guess I'm a little surprised with the directionality of both. The quarter's sales release indicated ATPs were about flat. So how is pricing so positive? And on the flip side, we know that truck production was quite strong and fleet was cut. Why was mix negative? I'm not sure if it's a definitional issue that falls in those buckets. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: First, transaction price is unadjusted for mix. At the end of the day, it's a compilation of everything. So when we looked at the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year, from a transaction price perspective, we sold a heck of a ton more Cruzes in the first quarter this year versus last year. So, that is why we can have favorable EBIT pricing or profit pricing on trucks, but transaction prices are relatively flat. And then I think if you look at the North American EBIT bridge, you see the other piece of this equation play out. Mix was unfavorable, fundamentally because we sold a lot more Cruzes in the first quarter of the year this year than we did last year as we are launching the product. So that's the overall answer to that question, Colin. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And can you give any color on commodity mix? What is your expectation for headwind this year and if there was any impact in the quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: As we entered the year, on my little chart that I showed at Deutsche Bank and Office Hours, there were tailwinds and headwinds, and on one of the headwinds was commodity pricing and we expected to see a few hundred million dollar headwind year over year, and we built that into our expectation. For 2017, I would say as we sit today through April, that headwind is greater than we thought by another few hundreds of millions of dollars, I mean, $200 million to $300 million. Obviously, we're taking actions to mitigate that. And in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis, broadly speaking, commodities were about a $200 million headwind. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And just lastly in your comments you mentioned that battery costs are $145 and trending better \u2013 cost coming down faster than expected. Is the $145 \u2013 that's just the cell, right, that's not cell and pack. And then at what levels do you think you need to get to, to make an EV more compelling than the internal-combustion engine? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Right now when we talk about it, we have a cell cost per kilowatt hour that's around $145 and that's for the Bolt EV and we're working that \u2013 what we showed a couple of years ago, we're working on a path to get that, like I said, around $100 or below $100 and we're ahead of the curve on that. You have to look at the whole vehicle, how it comes together, the scale, the different offerings, is it in sharing environment. So, when we drive to that profitability, I can't just say we got to get it to act because you've got to really look at, there's many other levers that get us to be profitable in electric vehicle. Now, we're going to keep working aggressively on the cell cost and leveraging our scale. To drive you the profitability which is I think where you're asking the question, getting below $100, we'll get there and then we'll set another target. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thank you very much for taking my questions, and congrats on a good quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our final question for the day will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. I want to follow up with Chuck and Mary on again sort of this whole issue of big data. A question for Chuck is, in 2015 you outlined an incremental $350 million impact by 2018 from 4G LTE. Wondering where you're tracking to that, is it part of the cost savings we came through this quarter? And then for Mary, you've talked about the car architectures being relatively set, but on the other hand, it's pretty clear at least to some of us that big transformations needed in the vehicle data architecture, the connectivity. And just where are you on that and how do you expect that to evolve? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: To the first question, yeah, back in 2015, we said we expected OnStar to improve profitability and it was part \u2013 let me just start with \u2013 most recently we've talked about one of the drivers of improved profitability on a go-forward basis around adjacencies and within that, between the 2015 timeframe and 2019 timeframe we talked about roughly $2 billion of improvement in profit adjacencies. It's split between three areas, Customer Care and Aftersales or service parts, GM Financial which made up about half of it, and OnStar. So, if I was sizing the opportunity, I'd split the $2 billion, $1 billion GMF and $0.5 billion each roughly between OnStar and CCA. We're still driving towards that. We're still executing towards that. I would suggest in the results that we've seen thus far in North America relative to OnStar, it's been relatively limited because we're building up the foundation and building up the capability and it goes across many dimensions. 4G LTE is part of it, monetizing the data through vehicle management and onboard diagnostics is another piece, the application framework is another piece, but we're still very, very focused and constructive on driving that profitability because we think it's a huge opportunity. And Mary mentioned, we haven't even started to scratch the surface yet on data monetization and that wasn't factored into that outlook. So, that's another significant opportunity. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: And then, Brian, on the technical piece of it, we last year spent a considerable time. There'd already work being done, but had my personal attention and Mark Reuss on it as well as Randy Mott from an IT and we put the resources together much more into one integrated organization to drive, how did we quickly. Because now if you think about it, the car used to stop, it's a pain and now the car doesn't stop there because there's so many services or apps that you can use outside of the car to get the speed and the quality and the integrity to make sure we do it right from a safety and a cyber security perspective. We pulled that whole organization together, they operate under one person that we brought into the company. So, that's the way we're leveraging the engineering and then we do have a new electrical architecture coming in our vehicles that has been under development for a couple of years and will be launched shortly. So, we have addressed, I'll say, the core electrical architecture, but I think more importantly, bringing the resources and having the view that the car extends outside of the pain to make sure that we have the systems integrated well and that's the way that we operate today. And so, that's how we're addressing, I'll say, the tech piece of it to support the opportunity that we have to be first and fast in really leveraging this new area. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you, operator. I just got a couple of comments. I'm really proud of the team and what they've accomplished in this first quarter. This again, I think, demonstrates our resolve that we are going to continue to strengthen the core business, generate the best possible return for our owners and then continue to execute with a huge sense of urgency on the transformative technologies that are really going to allow us to have a leadership position and make people's lives safer, simpler, and better as we move forward. We are a very disciplined company as we approach this. I think, you've seen actions from us, you'll continue to see actions that represent us because myself, the leadership team and every GM employee, we are here to win. And that's what we focus on doing every day when we are at work or wherever we are. So, thanks again for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, July 25, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2017. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we had the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. We will then open the line for questions from the analyst's community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Global Business Services, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Rick Westenberg, Vice President and Treasurer to assist in answering your questions. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Dhivya, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. We delivered a strong second quarter despite a more challenging business environment that included softer industry sales in the U.S. and pricing challenges in China. Results from our continuing operations adjusted for the pending sale of our Opel/Vauxhall brands and GM Financial operations in Europe include net revenue of $37 billion, income of $2.4 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $3.7 billion, and EBIT-adjusted margin of 10%, EPS diluted of $1.60 and EPS diluted-adjusted of $1.89, EPS-adjusted of $3.5 billion in North America and EBIT-adjusted margins of 12.2%, adjusted automotive free cash flow of $2.6 billion, and our return on invested capital adjusted is 30.4% on a trailing four-quarter basis. This reflects the positive impact of our disciplined capital allocation framework. Also, important to note, that during the quarter we returned about $2.1 billion to shareholders, $600 million in dividends and $1.5 billion in share repurchases. We expect to return up to $7 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017 through dividends and share buybacks, subject to market conditions. We made significant moves in the quarter to strengthen our core business performance and capitalize on growth opportunities for the long term. In May, we announced our intent to restructure our international operations, to focus GM India on export manufacturing only, to transition our business in GM South America to ISUZU Motors and to phase out the Chevrolet brand in both markets by the end of the year. Combined with the pending sale of our Opel/ Vauxhall brands and GM Financial's business in Europe, our recent restructuring actions will allow us to deploy resources and capital to higher return opportunities, such as refreshing our profitable global SUV and U.S. full-size truck portfolios and our global emerging-market vehicle program. We will also continue the growth of GM Financial and our very profitable after-sales, will continue leveraging our connectivity leadership through OnStar, and transforming Cadillac to lead in the global high-margin luxury segment. We're also investing in transformative technologies around electrification, autonomous technology, connectivity, and shared mobility services as part of our continuing work to redefine the future of personal mobility. We will continue to build on our significant progress by driving improvements across markets and in product segments to deliver the appropriate returns. Now, let's take a look at a few of the regions that really drove our performance in the quarter. First North America. In the United States, our total sales and retail sales and market share are on pace with last year's first half performance and ahead of the industry. We believe our disciplined go-to-market strategy is paying off. Our retail sales mix of 6% in Q2 was not only the lowest among full-line automakers in the U.S., it was our lowest for GM in eight years. We are also seeing disciplines on incentives. Our incentives spend, as a percentage of average transaction price, was about 12% in the second quarter, down two full percentage points from the first quarter. We continue to grow in the critical crossover segments that are most popular with consumers. GM's retail crossover share in Q2 was up 24% year-over-year, representing the best quarter in our history for crossover sales. As we prepare to launch four more crossovers in the second half, this is a strong starting point. Overall GM's crossover retail market share increased 1.7% year-over-year, or 1.7 points year-over-year. Cadillac SUV sales were up 16% year-over-year, the best Q2 in history. Buick sales were up 16% year-over-year, its best Q2 since 2005. Our average transaction price in Q2 of $35,000 was essentially flat year-over-year exceeding the overall industry by about $3,800 and we continue to make strides on vehicle quality. In the J.D. Power Initial Quality Study, Fort Wayne assembly received the 2017 Gold Plant Quality Award for the Americas for the highest manufacturing quality. The plant builds light and heavy-duty Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickups, which led their segments, and the GMC Sierra and Sierra heavy-duty. As we moved to China, GM China set a Q2 sales record with deliveries of 852,000 vehicles, up about 1% year-over-year. Cadillac and Baojun also set Q2 sales records on strong sales of the Cadillac XT5 and Baojun 510. Cadillac sales were up 62% and Baojun sales were up 66% year-over-year in the quarter. Year-to-date Cadillac is up 70%. Deliveries of the Chevrolet Equinox SUV in China surpassed 10,000 units since its launch in late April. And the Velite 5, Buick's first extended range electric vehicle made its global debut in April. We expect it to go on sale later this year. I also want to make a few points about South America. Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, we posted a year-over-year improvement to essentially breakeven. Our sales and market share gains outpaced the industry and Chevrolet continues its 17-year market leadership. In the quarter, South America delivered 160,000 vehicles, up 18% year-over-year and market share rose 0.7 points. Throughout the first half of 2017, sales were up more than 14% compared to a year ago. As we look at the technologies that are transforming our industry, our commitment to leading in this transformation and the future of personal mobility includes making game-changing technologies available to as many customers as possible. We are excited that the Chevrolet Bolt EV, the first affordable long-range electric vehicle, goes on sale nationwide August 1 at certified Chevrolet dealerships. More than 80% of Bolt EV customers have not previously owned a Chevrolet. Chevrolet has sold nearly 8,200 Bolt EVs since they went on sale in December of 2016. Our Cruise Automation team in San Francisco and our technical experts in Warren are making significant progress in our drive to safely deploy our self-driving electric vehicles in commercial ridesharing networks. Last month GM became the first company to use mass production methods to build 130 autonomous vehicles, growing our test fleet to 180. We plan to deploy these vehicles in the challenging driving environment of San Francisco, as well as Scottsdale, Arizona, and Metro Detroit where we are already testing our vehicles today. In addition, technologies like Super Cruise are helping us create a safer future. As we prepare for the fall introduction of Super Cruise on the 2018 Cadillac CT6, GM engineers have logged roughly 160,000 miles of driving on U.S. and Canadian highways as part of the final validation of the system. And when it comes to shared mobility, we keep refining Maven to meet customers' needs as we learn more about the growing sharing economy and freelance economy. In addition to expanding Maven City in New York, we announced that Maven Gig will be in California in three cities. Freelancers can rent Chevrolet Bolt EVs for delivery and ridesharing services. So as we look at H2, we clearly see a tougher business environment and the entire GM team has a disciplined and relentless focus on doing what is necessary to address challenges. For example, in addition to the actions in Europe and our international operations, we are managing passenger car output to ensure our inventories are appropriate and to protect our brands. In North America, our crossover launches continue with the Chevrolet Equinox and the Chevrolet Traverse, the GMC Terrain, and the Buick Enclave. We will also launch the Equinox in Q4 in South America and launch 10 newer refreshed models in China. As Chuck shared with many of you last month, we expect another strong year in North America with EBIT-adjusted margins of 10%-plus. In addition, on a continuing operations basis, we still expect our EPS diluted-adjusted to be in the $6.00 to $6.50 range for the full year. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. We had another strong quarter capping off a record first half of the year. On a continuing operations basis, we generated net revenue of $74.3 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $7.2 billion, and an EBIT-adjusted margin of 9.7% in the first half of the year. Our strong second quarter is another proof point of our commitment to price and cost discipline. Our performance also underscores the benefits of the strategic actions we've taken to focus the company on markets and segments where we have strong competitive positions and believe we can drive higher returns. North America continued to lead, overcoming softer industry conditions to generate first half revenue of $57.8 billion, up nearly 2% year-over-year. EBIT-adjusted of $6.9 billion, up 13% versus the first half of 2016, and a 12% EBIT-adjusted margin, an increase of 1.2 percentage points versus 2016. For the second quarter, North American EBIT-adjusted was $3.5 billion with a 12.2% margin, driven primarily by solid cost improvement of $600 million and improved mix of $500 million as we are just starting to see the benefits of our strong crossover launches and our focus on cost continues. Through the second quarter, we've generated about $5 billion in cost efficiencies since 2014 and are on our way to achieve our goal of $6.5 billion by the end of 2018. Shifting to inventory, as we have indicated, we built inventory in the first half in preparation for our previously announced downtime in trucks and crossovers in the second half of the year. We're also committed to take action on passenger cars, which we have done and will continue to do as required to align supply and demand. And as we exit the second quarter, we are generally on plan with days supply at 105 days. We are committed to bring inventory in line with year-end 2016 levels of about 70 days supply by the end of this year. Clearly, our production will be impacted in the third quarter and the second half. We expect factory unit sales in North America to be down about 150,000 units in the second half versus the first half. With that said, and consistent with our last Office Hours session and the comments Mary just made, we fully expect to generate strong 10%-plus margins in North America in 2017. Moving on to China, China generated another $500 million of equity income in the second quarter for a total of $1 billion of equity income for the first half, both flat year-over-year. We continue to benefit from shifting consumer preferences and our strength with new products in the luxury, SUV and crossover segments. Again, we are very much on track to deliver another year of strong equity income in China. Turning to South America. In the first half, revenue was $4.3 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 43% year-over-year and the EBIT-adjusted loss was about $100 million, a $40 million improvement from a year ago. As Mary mentioned, we essentially broke even in the second quarter, highlighting that our new breakeven SAAR is approximately 2.2 million units in Brazil. Based on that, we have reduced our breakeven point by about 40% from the last peak in 2012. We expect our second half results to continue our year-over-year improvement, driven by a modest industry recovery and the strength of our portfolio on brands in South America. A few words on GM Financial, the corporate sector, free cash flow and share buybacks. GM Financial generated quarterly revenue of $3 billion, up 40% from $2.1 billion in 2016, resulting in record earnings before taxes of about $400 million in the quarter, up about 67% year-over-year despite continued pressure in residual values. Through the first half, GM Financial generated almost $600 million of earnings before taxes, up about $200 million, or 44% versus the first half of 2016, driven by a 41% increase in revenue to $5.7 billion. We do expect the decline in used-car pricing to continue to put pressure on GM Financials' residual values through the second half of 2017, and we would expect some moderation in earnings in the second half, but we will still deliver solid year-over-year earnings growth for the full year. Corporate costs were about $500 million in the second quarter with the first half total of approximately $800 million, including spending on autonomous and other future mobility initiatives. As discussed during our recent Office Hours webcast, the corporate sector will include about $200 million of annual legacy European costs going forward, primarily related to retained pension expense. Also going forward, we would expect the corporate sector will result in a net expense of approximately $400 million to $500 million quarterly. Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the second quarter was $2.6 billion for a first half total of $2 billion. This is an improvement of $300 million compared to the first half of 2016, driven primarily by improved automotive net income. CapEx was $4.1 billion for the first half and we expect full-year capital expenditures on a continuing operations basis to be approximately $8 billion. Our strong cash flow performance enabled us to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares in the second quarter, along with $600 million in dividends. Due to the pending sale of Opel/Vauxhall and GM Financial's European operations to the PSA Group, GM has provided our 2017 outlook on a continuing operations basis, which is described in more detail in our Analyst Deck. We expect revenue, EBIT-adjusted, and EBIT-adjusted margins to meet or exceed our 2016 performance on a continuing operations basis. And it's fair to say that when compared to what we reported in February for 2016, we expect EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins to improve. Adjusted auto free cash flow is expected to be approximately $7 billion. This is in line with our original guidance of $6 billion after taking into account the approximate $1 billion impact of European related cash flow. And we anticipate to generate a ROIC-adjusted of greater than 25% for the year. We expect our cash generation, along with our ability to reduce our cash balance by $2 billion after the Europe transaction closes, to allow us to return up to $7 billion to our shareholders in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases, again, subject to market conditions. And as Mary mentioned, we still expect to deliver EPS diluted-adjusted in the $6.00 to $6.50 range, supported by our strong first half performance and the benefit of the Opel/Vauxhall sale. This concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Our first question is going to come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. I want to follow-up more on the strategic question. First, can you give us some sense on the car side, especially after your exit from PSA? Just sort of what your ongoing investments in sedans are going to be over the next several years? How you're thinking really about South America and Asia-Pac ex-China? And was there any discussion of those potentially going along with the Opel sale? I think South America might've been originally established as an Opel branch. And just kind of as you think about your capital, what's the incremental return of putting it into cars versus crossover and pickups? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning, Brian. So, first, I think with the Opel/Vauxhall transaction, we've said that \u2013 and with the announcements that we made in India and South Africa, that we believe we're in the right market. We have a very strong franchise in South America and as I said in my opening remarks, we're going to continue to work to improve performance and efficiency in each country and by segment. So from a where we intend to play, I think that outlines that. When you look specifically at passenger cars, recall we just launched the compact and midsize architectures, the Chevrolet-branded Malibu and Cruise, a very, very efficient architecture that we believe will get two-plus lifecycles out of because of the design of that architecture. So we think we're well positioned. And although to your point, we are seeing smaller car segments and the impact of consumers choosing crossovers and trucks and SUVs, to a certain extent around the globe, we feel \u2013 and I'm not going to go into specifics of outlining the entire product portfolio, but we have taken a very much an over-the-horizon look of where we think that's going. We have very efficient architectures that are installed. And so I think we can leverage that very effectively to be well-positioned as the market continues to transform. As we talk, we also have very strong SUVs and crossovers that we're rolling out first half of this year, continue to do that in the second half. So I think we're going to be well-positioned to capitalize on that growth and then well-positioned from a car perspective. Finally, from an emerging market, those China, South America, Mexico, and some of the other more developing markets recall that we have made the investment in our global emerging markets platform that will have a range of vehicles coming off that \u2013 and this is a purposely designed architecture from a safety perspective, from an efficiency perspective, from a fuel economy perspective that we think will also be very well-positioned in those markets. So, again, we've looked at where we think the market is going and the trends are consistent with what we believe and the investments we've made in the plans that we have. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And I'm just looking at that capital allocation chart you put out for the recent conference, and propulsion is a chunk, it looks like $2-ish billion of that but stepping down post 2020. Is there any kind of way you could dimension how much that's going for ICE versus hybrids versus your pure electric efforts? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: We haven't broken that out, specifically, but what I would say is that I believe we are making the right investments from an electrification, and looking to really have platforms that go from eAssist to plug-in hybrids to full electric vehicles. And looking at that holistically across the portfolio. So that's the comment I would make but we're not breaking that out. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Morning. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a couple questions. One is the fixed cost savings that you are achieving in North America looks like it's quite high. Is North America basically already benefiting from the lower spending on passenger car development? Because your comments on longer-lasting platforms and gens coming? And at this point, on a continuing basis, ex-Europe, going forward, can you just talk about maybe some of the key earnings drivers that you have looking out to next year? Could this run rate of fixed cost reduction be sustained? Do you see some other positives starting to kick in? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, I would say, Rod, to your first question on the cost performance and the fixed cost performance in North America, there is very little engineering in there at this point in time. As you know, with the launch cadence of the crossovers here and then leading into the full-size pickup, the next-generation SUVs, we're probably at the peak from an engineering spend perspective and North America absorbs a pretty significant chunk of that. Where we're seeing the fixed cost opportunities are in manufacturing, SG&A, and you know, the non-engineering pieces of the business and consistent with our $5 billion run rate, and really being supported and driven with operational excellence at Global Business Services and a lot of focus from our manufacturing perspective. When I think about North America next year, and I don't know if the drivers of your question are specific to fix costs or specific to kind of the continued run rate at 10%, clearly our product launch cadence is going to be supportive. We're going to continue to drive efficiency across the board wherever we can find it from a cost standpoint. I would expect to see engineering costs, over the next couple of years, start to wind down as we work our way through this very large portfolio launch cadence that we have in front of us here in 2017, 2018 and 2019. We still have opportunities in manufacturing for sure. When you look at benchmarking on where we stand versus harbor from a productivity perspective. So, I think that we're going to continue to very much focus on driving efficiency across the board, not just fixed cost but commercial performance, quality, warranty, the whole nine yards because I think there's opportunities across all of those in North America. And we're seeing some of the benefit in the first half of this year across all of those dimensions. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So can you quantify what kind of targets you might be looking at in terms of net cost reduction or fixed cost reduction in North America looking forward beyond this year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Not at this point. In July, I would say, again, we've delivered $5 billion of efficiency through the second quarter against our $6.5 billion target through 2018. That's overall level. Clearly, most of that accrues to North America. We expect to achieve that $6.5 billion. So that will kind of size up that run rate but to get into the specifics at a North American by component perspective, not at this point beyond. We're very much on track on that $6.5 billion and the vast majority of that will accrue to North America. And we had said before that roughly half of that would fall to the bottom line, right? Net of incremental investment, marketing, D&A, technology. So there will be a benefit to North America from that perspective. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then lastly, obviously there's a lot of focus in the industry on the auto 2.0 businesses that you guys have been investing in. Financially today, the biggest needle mover that you've quantified, I think, is Cruise. You guys had said that you're going to spend about $150 million a quarter on autonomous. OnStar today is contributing revenue. Can you just update us on where OnStar is? What's the run rate of that business? And any high-level thoughts on financial targets for these businesses or the value that you see in them? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, let me speak specifically to OnStar. And Mary will talk to Cruise slash autonomous vehicles. As we've talked about before, yes, OnStar is generating revenue. We don't disclose that separately. It continues to grow. What we have said was we expected to see improved profitability rolling through North America of roughly $0.5 billion by the 2018, 2019 timeframe associated with the growth of OnStar. I'd say we're still executing to that. Feels more like a 2019 timeframe and that was compared to 2015. So, we expect to see some accretion from a earnings perspective on OnStar. And that is, obviously, taking full advantage of 4G LTE, our revenue share with AT&T, and the services that we provide, application framework, et cetera, et cetera. But that's still what we're executing to. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: And from an auto 2.0, as you look at specifically autonomous vehicles, of course, built on which we think is the most efficient platform on the all-electric vehicles. So leveraging the Bolt EV platform, I think we are moving aggressively in the development of that technology. As I noted, that we built the next 130 vehicles that we are in the process of deploying onto roads in San Francisco, Scottsdale, and Metro Detroit, leveraging manufacturing at scale methods to be able to build those vehicles. So when I look at where we're at, we're working aggressively at leveraging the assets General Motors brings to this, also learnings that we have from Maven. You know, we've talked about the true opportunity in this business which we think will first come in ridesharing. And we think that can be significant and then grow even further. We haven't sized that yet, but I would say we're working very aggressively on auto 2.0 to make sure we have substance and technology that we believe will generate significant shareholder value. And as we move forward, we'll be able to size that and put some milestones and timing around that. So I would say stay tuned. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Could you talk about the profit strength at GM Financial? It looks like 2Q was a record profit even as investors have been worrying about subprime defaults and lower used-car residual prices. So what has the trends been in charge-offs and provision? And how would you rate the sustainability of the better GMF results? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, I would say, first, from a credit perspective, the overall headline numbers are improving and that's a function of mix as we take on more prime business. But I would say within that, GMF continues to perform very well. Subprime, we have been relatively flat-lined on our subprime business over the last number of years and haven't grown that. And we perform, actually, better than the market does from a subprime perspective. So overall, stable results from a credit perspective. Clearly, we grew revenue in the quarter as we continue to grow our prime business and that drove a fairly significant portion of the improvement. We continue to be very focused on operating expense and that was a benefit in the quarter as well. As I said earlier in my comments, though, we do expect to see that run rate moderate in the second half of the year. Clearly, the used-car pricing and the impact on residuals was more, maybe not clearly, but I'll provide that perspective. Now is more backend loaded into the second half of the year. We're still guiding around a 7% reduction on a year-over-year basis in 2017 versus 2016 and further moderation in 2018, and we want to make sure we mark to that as we go through the year. With that said, I would still expect to see overall performance improve on a year-over-year basis, solid improvement at GM Financial and another driver is we're growing our business in China as well and that's flowing through GMF from a equity income perspective. And that's going to provide a year-over-year tailwind as well. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's very helpful, thanks. And then just lastly from me, a question on consolidated IO. It looks like their losses there narrowed quite a bit. What was the driver of that? Were any of the operations in either India or South America maybe moved into discontinued operations, or is it pretty comparable year-over-year? And then what should we think about the cadence of the expected savings from the restructuring actions announced during the quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, I would say they're not in discontinued ops. It's comparable on a year-over-year basis. I think one of the benefits that we saw in the second quarter was the sale of our East Africa business and we picked up a reasonable gain on that $40 million, partially offset by some charges we took related to Uzbek. I'd say there was some timing, too, relative to the flows of production into the Middle East. Very little run rate savings associated with the restructuring actions. I would expect to see those play out in 2018. We will continue to lean out the Singapore headquarters office as we move through the end of this year and complete those restructurings in India and South Africa as we move through this year. And as we indicated, we would expect to see about $100 million a year run rate improvement. With that said, we still have plenty of work to do in our consolidated operations. The Middle East remains challenging and it is pretty volatile right now when you look at the industry conditions there. We have to continue to focus on cost efficiency in Korea. We're starting to stabilize our business in Australia. We expect to see some improved results in Southeast Asia, but we still have plenty of work to do in the remaining operations but we see a path to continue to improve that. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for all that color. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So just, Chuck, I'm hoping you can talk about just the cadence of earnings in Q3 and Q4 as you tacked up production actions. And also just specifically on free cash flow, I think the guidance does imply a significant improvement second half versus first half. Given the production cuts and the working capital swings, can you kind of help us, walk us through the puts and takes around that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. As we've been talking about earnings cadence since earlier this year and the expected downtime in the U.S., North America. And as I generally look at the consensus view of the second half of the year, I think we're in line from a overall cadence perspective, as I said back in January and talked about a couple of times in Office Hours, we would expect Q3 to be our weakest quarter of the year with 13-weeks of downtime in mid crossovers and full-size pickups, and then see a recovery in the fourth quarter. I think that same trend will impact free cash flow. I think Q3 will be relatively weak from the free cash flow perspective. And then we'll see a pickup in Q4 with improved earnings, and as we wind back up our pipeline, obviously that will have a favorable impact on payables. So those are the broad strokes. Itay, again, mostly being impacted \u2013 when I look at second half versus first half, the biggest driver is volume. And the biggest driver of that volume is North America and the downtime that we've talked about consistently, and that's what's going to drive the cadence. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. And just a second question. Going back to the $6.5 billion of costs savings. I think back in April, you alluded to seeing potential opportunities above that $6.5 billion post the Opel divestiture. Can you update us on that or able to size that up for us in terms of what that could be and the timing as well? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Itay, we definitely are working to improve that. I think first, we want to make sure we achieve the $6.5 billion and I think as Chuck said, we're well on track to do that. But the specific work that we're referencing is, as the Opel/Vauxhall transaction closes, we're looking at, how do we take structure and simplify the way we work and out of the company? And that work is actively going on right now and we'll continue to work that through the end of the year. That I think provides additional opportunity. And as Chuck said, achieving the $6.5 billion, but with the operational excellence toolset and mind-set that we're rolling out to the entire company about constantly improving the business, and we've had a very successful deployment where we have our top 1,600 people engaged in running projects. I think you're going to see a continual cost efficiency improvement mind-set as a company. But I'm not ready to take it up further from the $6.5 billion now, but I think as we move forward you'll see us continue to increase that number or set a new target once $6.5 billion is achieved Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Just a couple of questions. First, so Tesla's been out with a car capable of OTA updates in firmware for about five years now. Now excluding Cruise, does GM currently sell any car capable of OTA updates of firmware? Mary? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So on the updates. We have done over-the-air updates primarily to the OnStar system. We are in the process of deploying a new electrical architecture which is a pretty comprehensive undertaking, and that's well underway and being deployed as well as a whole new generation of infotainment systems. So you'll see us have that capability as we move forward. Right now it's pretty much limited to updates from an OnStar basis Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So any view on timing of when that new architecture could be out that could enable the, obvious, ability for your fleet to learn and revenue opportunities that are within? What side of 2020 could that be, do you think? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Before 2020. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Go ahead. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. So obviously, with the experience with OnStar and all the work you've been doing in mobility, you recognize that there's a huge opportunity to turn your car customers or your drivers into subscribers and to capture some revenue from the two or three billion miles a day that your fleet kind of conducts. But you don't get that. It's kind of a wasted opportunity right now. So, Mary, what's the plan for getting paid for the data opportunity? I'm curious. We hear from OEMs insurance, insurance, but like putting that aside. That's more obvious. Can you give us any example at all of a kind of revenue monetization you could do with the data? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, in our data monetization, I agree with you that the opportunity is there. I would say we are just in the initial steps of not only leveraging the data to provide more value to customers. You know, one of the assets that we have that will \u2013 is actually in touch right now so it will be leveraged shortly, is active health management of being able to assess different components in the vehicle and be able to alert customers ahead of time, schedule them for their vehicle to be fixed, unlock the door with OnStar. So really \u2013 and then fix the vehicle, lock it back up. That capability that is near-term that we have and will be deploying. So I think there is this segment around the data to how do you use data that we get from the vehicle and because we have the largest connected fleet to improve the customer experience and therefore pull people to our vehicles. And then the second piece, as you indicated, is more of a B2B opportunity. And I don't have any specific examples that I'm going to share right now but I can tell you we're actively working both internally and externally. We just hired a Chief Data Officer into the company, started this month and so there's quite a bit of work going on. You'll hear more as we go forward but I think we're seeing monetization through OnStar with different activities. And like you said, insurance is one but there's additional framework. We recently also launched OnStar Go with IBM and that creates a marketplace that's able to be customized for our specific passengers or consumers. So more to come on this, Adam, and I agree with you of the opportunity and we've got to seize it. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. We look forward to meeting the Chief Data Officer. And one final one to squeeze in. There's been some talk about the Chinese government considering changing rules to allow foreign OEMs a chance to buy out 50% stake of the JVs if they don't already own. Mary is this a trap? I mean, what's the catch here? One could argue that the skills transferability into like auto 2.0 for right now from your partners, could be challenged, particularly with the uncertainty around the rulemaking from the government. I'm just curious how you view that. Is that something, if there was an opportunity to acquire, is that something \u2013 how do you feel about that opportunity? Or is it not an opportunity? Thanks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, as I look at potential changes in the rules, we have a very strong partner with SAIC, been very productive and are working together and I think it's been demonstrated in our market performance, we do joint development. A big portion of the global emerging-market platform that work is being done in China. So we've integrated the PATAC Center. So as I look at regulatory changes or rule changes from a China perspective, this isn't one on the top of my list because I think we work together well and I think there's benefits to that. What I am looking for is to make sure that we have a level playing field and that we have rules that are aligned with the timing required to effectively implement from an automotive company perspective. When you look at some of the latest rulemaking around electrification, being implemented now and being rolled out now with implementation next winter, that's a pretty short timeline to effectively and efficiently meet those requirements. So that would be something I'd look for before I'd look for relaxing of the 50%. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thank you, Mary. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Adam. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you for taking our questions. Maybe we just come back to North America for a second. We think about your production cadence. It sounds like a lot of the downtime is going to be taken in the third quarter, but with the market a little bit softer year-over-year, do you see a need to raise your incentive levels in order to move your passenger cars in order to hit that 50 days of inventory by the end of the year? Do you expect a rebound in retail sales or demand for pass car in the back half? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, I would say that we're going to remain disciplined from an incentive perspective as we go through the second half of the year. The first lever that I would pull, and this is Chuck Stevens speaking. The North American team will probably have their own perspectives but the first lever I would pull would be the production lever to ensure that we align supply and demand. We do not want to damage the brand. Clearly, there is a shift in passenger cars to crossovers but the compact segment is still a big segment here. And we still want to continue to improve the financial performance of those cars at whatever buy-in levels that we sell. And we want to reach kind of a natural demand so that we can get our manufacturing footprint, and logistics, and supplier footprints all aligned around that. So I would say we're going to pull the production lever. With that said, we will be competitive, but certainly wouldn't anticipate significant price moves or incentive moves from that perspective. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So embedded in that you are expecting somewhat of a pickup in passenger car demand in the back half of this year since we've seen a passenger car recession if you will, beginning what, a couple years ago? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. I would say broadly speaking what we expect to see is better sales in the second half versus the first half, which is kind of the way the industry runs. Within that perhaps marginally better passenger car, but we're certainly not counting on a recovery. Obviously, our launch cadence is pretty critical from our perspective with all the new crossovers that we're launching, and that's going to help in the second half of the year. But we're not \u2013 we will take production out to align supply and demand on passenger cars wherever that demand lands. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you, Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then just moving to your autonomous vehicles, I've got a couple of questions there. First, when you think about the breakdown of a fully autonomous vehicle, a lot of compute power needed, a lot of power draw. Where do you fall on the line of needing a pure battery-electric vehicle versus a plug-in hybrid approach? Second, when you think about the current sensor suite, specifically to LIDAR, do you believe that hardware is necessary? Or do you think you can operate your vehicles autonomously without a LIDAR? And then I'll have a third one and a follow-up for Super Cruise. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Clearly the \u2013 we believe that most efficient way to execute autonomous vehicles is with the pure EV, that's why we are using our Bolt EV platform. And we think it allows for more efficient integration to the vehicle. We do believe in a sensor suite that LIDAR is a part of its solution to have the right sensing to provide the right safety level. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then the last one, thank you, Mary, is just on the miles needed for validation. I think the shareholder letter mentioned about 160,000 miles of validation for the Super Cruise currently. Is that enough? And how do you gauge that as being enough? And then if we extrapolate from there to fully-autonomous vehicle, what do you think is going to be necessary for validation in terms of miles for fully autonomous? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, first on Super Cruise, recall that we actually held that technology till we did appropriate validation, the 160,000 miles that we talk about, I'll say, would be final validation. That was substantially more work done from the Super Cruise development, testing and validation for the company to feel that it met our requirements from a safety perspective to launch into the public. From an autonomous vehicle perspective, miles driven is certainly a factor, but it's not the only factor, because what is the quality of the miles driven? Right now, to our knowledge, we're the only one testing our autonomous vehicles in Downtown San Francisco, which is a pretty dense urban environment with a lot more, I'll say, opportunities to learn from different situations. So it's not just the miles traveled. It's the quality of those miles in the number of incidents that you're exposed to that the vehicle learns. And so although we don't have a very specific mile, there's quite a bit of work we're doing, even with agencies or groups outside of the company to put that together. As we move forward, we'll share, because as we understand it today with the NHTSA requirements for U.S., a big portion of the guidelines they put out is to demonstrate how you're measuring, and then share that as they look at authorizing, pulling the driver out of the vehicle. So there's quite a bit of work going on there. So I would say it's much more involved than just miles traveled. And that's what we're working on right now, and we'll share more as we go forward. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Appreciate the time. Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Just a first relatively I think simple question, as we look at sort of the bottom line guidance, it hasn't really changed much, but you've put Europe on a discount basis. So that should be about a $400 million benefit. Is basically the pressure that you're seeing, or the deterioration in North America market just generally the offset? Or is that a oversimplification? And are there other factors that are at work here? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. I think you're drawing the conclusion that we have fundamentally reduced our guidance, or used the European dynamic to offset other impacts. If you start at the top, and say on a continuing ops basis, we haven't changed our guidance on EBIT or margins, that would lead you to we haven't changed. And in fact, we've probably improved our guidance on EPS. It's in the range of $6 to $6.50 and still in the range of $6 to $6.50, but you guys can do the math and the impact of excluding Europe is probably depending on whose model you pick, $0.12 to $0.15 a share. We're still in that range, so we didn't change the guidance, but certainly if again, starting at EBIT and EBIT margins, we expect to be greater than or equal to 2016 results on a continuing ops basis. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. That's very helpful. And then a second question. If we think about the pressures in North America and if they continue, Chuck, are there any other levers other than sort of the structural items that you've outlined so far, maybe going to external measures and looking at your partners on the dealer and supplier base that are, in some cases, making a lot more money? Is there an opportunity to spread the pain through the value chain and work with your partners? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, we work with our partners across the value chain on a day-to-day basis. I think we get into a slowdown thing. The first thing is to take full advantage of driving as much efficiency as you can in the things that you control. And what we control directly, to a large extent, is our own cost base and our own fixed cost. And that's where, as you know, we have significant leverage, much more so than we did back in 2008 and 2009. And as we've talked about before, we believe there's $3 billion to $4 billion of cost efficiency that we could drive as we entered a downturn, assuming it was a 25% downturn. We work continuously with our suppliers. We've been strategically engaged with our suppliers over the last number of years. You look at the commercial and technical performance that we've been generating and as a big part of that $5 billion that we've generated to date, that's because of our relationship with the suppliers, much different than it used to be in the past. Work, bring their best ideas to the table, innovate. So I'm sure if we were in a challenging environment, we would work it with our suppliers. We worked with our dealers in 2008 and 2009. I'm sure we would continue to work with our dealers on a go-forward basis. One example of that is when we had the challenges back in 2014. We never lost any share. The dealers repaired millions of vehicles while taking care of customers, while continuing to help us achieve our business objectives, and that's a strong partnership. The other thing I would say is in a downturn and we don't talk about it a lot, customer care and aftersales is countercyclical and that will help us to keep our earnings robust and outperform going through the downturn, as well. So again, a number of levers to pull, a number of partnerships we'd certainly want to leverage as we go into it, and we leverage those today. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. And then just lastly on the crossover launches. I mean, was curious what kind of an opportunity you think there is directionally and maybe even in numbers on the pricing on these crossovers in the near term. And then in the long term, that is a segment that a lot of folks are obviously chasing. It looks like the nameplates based on our estimates are going to go up 40% the next year. So that segment does get a little bit more crowded. Do you think in the near term pricing opportunity and then the long term, is there risk that the competition erodes maybe some of these excess economic profits in the segment? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, we expect that there's a pricing opportunity in the near term and clearly in the second half of the year. When you look at second half of 2017 versus second half of 2016, we think price is going to be a tailwind for us from a crossover launch perspective. But I'd also agree with you in the medium term that there's likely to be margin compression in the crossover segment, especially the small and compact. Mid-crossover, I think there's a few less competitors, but in the small and compact segments. And again, that's why we're so focused on driving cost efficiency and taking advantage of our scale from that perspective because we anticipate price erosion as we move through the lifecycle of these vehicles and margin compression, at least from a pricing perspective. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Just one last quick housekeeping. The lease levels in the U.S. in the quarter, what was that and what do you see for the industry? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: In Q2, we were at 31%. The industry was about 30%. We're generally in line with where we were last year and in the first quarter, so we're running generally at industry levels. June, we came down to 29%, so on a downward trajectory. I think we're reasonably comfortable in the 25% to 30% range depending on the dynamics. So again, running at industry levels, been relatively consistent over the last number of quarters. Probably at the top end of where we want to be from a leasing perspective and we'll work to bring that down, especially as rates increase, then subvented financing has a tendency to pick up as well. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : Chuck, I wanted to come back to some of the early 2018 outlook factors for GMNA. And clearly the product launch cadence will be supportive and the engineering costs you expect them to keep coming down. How should we think about the volume piece of the equation for GMNA? Is the downtime for the continued changeover process, is it comparable to 2017 or could it be a longer downtime and we could see some volume pressure there? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, I would say that early days, right? We're in July. We're certainly operating in an environment right now kind of month-to-month to see how the U.S. industry develops, but I would say all else being equal, we would expect to see more truck downtime next year versus this year. But by the same token, we will have incremental opportunities for compact and mid-crossovers next year because we've got significant downtime. But if I was providing an outlook right now, I would say probably production volume is going to be down in 2018 versus 2017 given the downtime. But I still, again, in July still would suggest that North America in a 17 million-ish SAAR environment is a 10%-plus EBIT margin company next year as well, absent some unexpected events. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : That's extremely helpful. And then, Mary, you were mentioning on the autonomous side, the first opportunity will come in ridesharing. And over the past week, Lyft announced that it's starting its own autonomous driving research efforts. And what is the impact from that on your own autonomous strategy and then your partnership with Lyft? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I don't think it affects it. The partnership that we have with Lyft was never exclusive for either Lyft or for General Motors. We're quite far along in our autonomous vehicle development based on the fact that shortly we'll have 180 vehicles testing. I don't know if you've had a chance to see the different videos that we posted of the capability of our autonomous vehicles to date that grows frankly on a weekly basis. So we still think the opportunity to deploy in a ridesharing. And the reason for that is as you first have electric vehicles as the capability will go up in those vehicles from the speed at which they can travel, the different circumstances, tunnels, et cetera, that the vehicle is capable of learning. So integrating in a shared fleet \u2013 in a ridesharing fleet I think allows to get the best exposure for the vehicle to keep learning as we go forward, but I would say that's in the early stages of sub-deployment. So again, we have a good relationship with Lyft and we think that opportunity presents itself, but that's how we see it playing out right now, and again, understand their work that they're doing on their own as well. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Our final question for today will come from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on Emmanuel's first question. I adjust forecasting and pretty significant double-digit decline and pick up next year. I mean from your tone, do you think that \u2013 any comment on that? Is that too bearish given what you're looking at now? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Help me with a little bit of context on that. I just was looking at a double-digit decline in production for full size pickups next year for General Motors. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Yes. Sorry. Yes. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Again, it's early days as we think about next year and I would say built in kind of the baseline plan at this point in time when we think about the incremental downtime next year, could we be off 10% production next year versus this year? Yes, that's a possibility, but I think it's just too early at this point in time because we always are looking at trying to optimize the timing and the amount of downtime that we have related to launch cadence. So surely we will provide more visibility around that as we close out the year and early next year. Again, I would just return to my earlier comment and similar to the comment I made for 2017, the North American business model is proving to be very resilient to some of the challenges that we're facing. We believe this year we will generate 10%-plus EBIT margins based on our first look at 2018 under a reasonably constructive macro environment. We believe that we'll continue to generate 10%-plus EBIT margins. There will be puts and takes. More visibility around that as we move through this year and get a better sense of where the market is heading. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And when we look at your target of getting inventory to around 70 days by year-end, is that all driven by the, I think you mentioned, 150,000 first half versus second half reduction in production or is there some assumption that market share, actually, picked up by the end of the year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think it's a bit of both. Largely, the production, because just to give you the data points, last year we ended at 980,000 units of inventory. We want to be in the 800,000 to 825,000 at the end of this year. That would equate, based on our view of the industry, to somewhere in the ZIP Code of 70-day supply. So a significant portion, the majority is going to be production cuts but we also grow share generally in the second half the year because trucks, generally, you sell 60% of those in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. So obviously, we expect to see \u2013 and by the way, with our launch cadence as well, we expect to see some sales performance but the vast majority of the reduction in inventory will be related to production cuts. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We believe the strong results we reported today reflect on our ongoing work to transform GM into a more focused and disciplined company. This team has demonstrated quarter after quarter that it has the right mindset to capitalize on opportunities, make the hard decisions, overcome headwinds, and meet our commitments all with integrity. We're going to continue to take bold and decisive actions to execute our strategic plan and that's in the core business or Auto 1.0 where we're working to make sure we have the right product portfolio as we move forward, as well as the very, very efficient business on all aspects. And then from a future of personal ability, or Auto 2.0, we are taking very deliberate steps and working, I'd say, quite aggressively to make sure that we leverage all the assets we bring to this equation. We believe we can translate that into significant shareholder value and that's what we're focused on doing. So again, thanks for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, October 24, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2017. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we had the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. We will then open the line for questions from the analyst's community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Global Business Services, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Rick Westenberg, Vice President and Treasurer to assist in answering your questions. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Dhivya, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. The results we are reporting today on a continuing operations basis demonstrate our commitment to extending our strong core business performance while redefining the future of personal mobility. Taking a look at the numbers we posted, EBIT adjusted is $2.5 billion. Year-to-date, EBIT adjusted is $9.8 billion with a margin of 9%. And our EPS diluted adjusted is $1.32. We returned $2 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and our return on invested capital adjusted is 27.6% on a trailing four quarter basis. We delivered solid results even with planned lower third quarter production in North America. Although market is more challenging than expected, we will deliver another strong year. Chuck will share additional details in regional numbers in a few minutes. Our work to strengthen the business and focus on areas with higher shareholder return continued with the closing of the sale of our Opel-Vauxhall business. We expect to close the sale of GM Financial's European operations by the end of the year. In addition to the international operations restructuring we previously announced, earlier this month we shared that we will combine all GM operations outside of China and North America under Barry Engle, effective 01/01/2018. This allows us to realize greater efficiencies and supports our disciplined plan to operate in the right markets to strengthen our performance and to focus on long-term growth opportunities. From a product and brand standpoint, customers are responding favorably to our new vehicle launches. In the United States, retail sales of crossovers from our Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and Cadillac brands were up 25% year-over-year for our best crossover sales quarter in history. The second generation of the 2018 Buick Enclave is arriving at dealership. It builds on the success of its predecessor and ushers in Avenir, Buick's new upscale sub brand. We have high expectations for Avenir as it joins Denali GMC's premium sub-brand in our Buick GMC retail channel. Denali makes up more than a quarter of GMC's overall sales and generates higher margins and average transaction prices. Avenir and Denali will offer our customers attainable luxury from our premium brands. Also arriving at U.S. dealerships is the 2018 Cadillac CT6 with Super Cruise, hands-free highway driving technology. Journalists and influencers recently traveled coast-to-coast to demonstrate its capability with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Super Cruise will also launch in China next year on the CT6. Sales in China are tracking at a record pace, led by the growth at China \u2013 or excuse me at Cadillac and Baojun. To continue this momentum, we launched five new models in the quarter, including the Baojun E100 EV. This is a niche build-to-order electric vehicle from our JV partner SGMW. We plan to launch six additional models in Q4. Last month in Shanghai, I helped celebrate our 20-year joint venture with SAIC GM and the production of our 15 millionth vehicle. It was an important milestones representing a productive partnership in our largest market. And in South America, we are now gaining market share and making money in an industry still significantly depressed from prior high levels. Now, I'd like to talk about the future of personal mobility. We all know the industry is changing very quickly. By staying focused and disciplined, we have repositioned our core business to be more resilient through the cycle and we have made key investments that will help us create a safer, better and more sustainable world and a healthy business model well into the future. We believe our future mobility initiatives will be accretive to our core business because they give us an opportunity to increase our exposure to new customers in urban centers and coastal markets. At the same time, our core operations will continue to generate strong profits in the markets that will be the last impacted by these new mobility trends. Regardless of where we do business, we are committed to an all-electric future, and we have announced plans for at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, including two in the next 18 months. We've already done a lot of the hard work, investment and innovation necessary to meet this commitment. Our extensive track record with electrification, including what we have learned from the Chevrolet Volt and the Chevrolet Volt EV along with strong supplier partnerships and mass market EV manufacturing experience give us confidence that this portfolio puts us on a path to a new profitable generation of electric vehicles. We will pursue both battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell technology because we will need both for solutions to meet all of our customers' transportation needs. For example, we revealed a new autonomous capable hydrogen fuel cell platform called the Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure or as we refer to here SURUS. It was designed to provide commercial vehicle solutions including flexible cargo delivery and utility services. But its ability to solve tough transportation challenges created by natural disasters, complex logistic environments and global conflict also make it adaptable for military use. I'm also pleased with the progress our team is making on self-driving vehicle technology. GM and Cruise Automation recently deployed our latest generation self-driving electric test vehicle. We believe it will meet the redundancy and safety requirements necessary to operate without a driver. It is our third generation of AD technology in just 14 months. The GM and Cruise teams have worked together to integrate the best hardware and software with an almost completely new and fault-tolerant systems that are unique to a driverless vehicle. In fact, the latest generation of self-driving electric test vehicle has about 40% unique content compared to previous generations. Another reason we are moving so fast is because we are testing in one of the most challenging urban environments anywhere, San Francisco. In this environment, we encounter almost 50 times more interactions with pedestrians and other vehicles and complex road intersections compared to driving in a suburban environment. This testing is accelerating our deployment of self-driving technology, and we believe it will put us on the path to the fastest path toward deploying self-driving cars safely and at scale. To move with even more speed, we also recently announced we will be opening a Cruise office in New York City to begin testing our self-driving cars there as well. And just two weeks ago, we acquired Strobe, gaining access to new LIDAR technology that will significantly improve the capability of self-driving cars and reduce the cost of each LIDAR on our self-driving cars by 99%. Finally, in August, we launched Cruise Anywhere, a ride-sharing beta test platform for select Cruise Automation employees in San Francisco. Employees use a GM smartphone app to hail a ride in a self-driving electric test vehicle. Focusing on all aspects of the self-driving experience gives us more flexibility to develop the appropriate go-to market strategy. Our vision is ambitious, and I believe GM is uniquely positioned to transform how we provide personal mobility for our customers. We have the right team with the right technical and business expertise to solve problems along with the passion to change the world. We will host an investor event later this year to share more details, so stay tuned. And now I'd like to turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. Our third quarter results from continuing operations demonstrate the resilience of our core business and continued disciplined execution of our plan. All of our operating segments were profitable this quarter for the first time since Q4 2014. This did not happen by chance. Our strategic initiatives, including the closing of the Opel-Vauxhall deal, in addition to our cost efficiency measures and product launch cadence are paying off. We remain solidly profitable and generated 8.3% margins in North America even with the planned downtime for our next-generation full-size trucks, and decisive actions to reduce production of passenger cars to right-size our inventory. South America had its first profitable quarter in three years. China continues to generate consistent equity income and GM Financial had a record third quarter. We generated net revenue of $33.6 billion, EBIT adjusted of $2.5 billion and an EBIT adjusted margin of 7.5% in the third quarter, contributing to a strong first nine months of the year. We've generated year-to-date net revenue of $107.9 billion, EBIT adjusted of $9.8 billion and an EBIT adjusted margin of 9%. During the quarter, we consumed $1 billion in cash as we expected with cash flow primarily impacted by our production downtime. As production levels normalize, we anticipate working capital to meaningfully contribute to fourth quarter adjusted automotive free cash flow. And importantly, we still plan to return approximately $7 billion in capital to shareholders this year. Moving to the segment details. North America has delivered year-to-date revenue of $82.6 billion, EBIT adjusted of $9 billion and a 10.9% EBIT adjusted margin, consistent with 2016 margin levels on 6% lower revenue. For the third quarter, North America revenue was $24.8 billion. EBIT-adjusted was $2.1 billion with an 8.3% margin despite a $2.1 billion headwind from a largely planned 26% reduction in wholesale volume. The performance was driven by improved mix of about $600 million as we reduced production of cars which more than offset the mix headwind from truck retooling. Solid improvements in cost including warranty of about $300 million also contributed to the performance. The actions we've taken will allow us to end the year with dealer inventory down compared to the end of 2016. And our focus on cost continues. During the third quarter, we have generated more than $5 billion in cost efficiency since 2014 and plan to achieve our more aggressive goal of $6.5 billion by the end of 2018, which more than offsets incremental investment in engineering, technology and D&A. Based on our disciplined cost initiatives and the strength of new crossovers, we continue to project strong 10-plus percent margins in North America for the full year 2017. Moving on to China. China generated another $500 million of equity income in the third quarter for a total of $1.5 billion of equity income year-to-date, both flat year-over-year. Pricing remains challenging with deterioration of at least 5% calendar year-to-date. Our focus on cost efficiency and the strength of our recent launches and growth in Cadillac have allowed us to mitigate the pricing headwinds as evidenced by another quarter of strong equity income, and we are forecasting that 2017 will be another year of strong overall equity income. Turning to South America. Year-to-date revenue was $6.8 billion, an increase of $1.8 billion or 36% year-over-year and the EBIT-adjusted loss was less than $100 million, a $200-million improvement from a year ago as the actions we've taken over the past several years are yielding benefits in a slightly improved macro climate. Our progress in South America paid off in the third quarter as the region generated $15 million of EBIT adjusted of $2.6 billion of revenue, our first profit in three years. Another segment that had strong third quarter performance is GM Financial. GM Financial generated quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion, up 30% from $2.4 billion in the third quarter of 2016, resulting in third quarter record earnings before taxes of about $300 million, up more than 60% year-over-year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, GMF generated almost $900 million of earnings before taxes, up about $300 million or almost 50% versus the three quarters of 2016 driven by a 38% increase in revenue to about $9 billion. We do see some headwinds in the fourth quarter for GM Financial driven primarily by residual value and used car pricing. One bit of housekeeping. Beginning in the three months ended December 31, 2017, we intend to change our segment reporting because of changes to our organizational structure. As a result, our South America and international operations will be reported as one combined international segment called GM International. Our North America and GM Financial segments will not be impacted. To summarize, overall this was another solid quarter even with significantly lower volumes. Our solid margins illustrate the benefits of the strategic actions we've taken resulting in a simpler, most focused business with a leaner cost structure. With the disciplined production actions we are taking, we project to be well-positioned going into 2018 with lower dealer inventory levels than year-end 2016, and that inventory will be better balanced to meet customer demands. As we think about our full year guidance, the operating environment is more challenging than we expected at the beginning of the year. We continue to take actions to adjust production in response to lower passenger car demand in North America. Raw material costs are on the rise, and we recently resolved the labor situation in Canada that resulted in unexpected down time. Despite these headwinds, we project strong financial results for the year including revenue, EBIT adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins generally in line with the record results we posted in 2016 and adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately $6 billion. We also continue to forecast earnings per share in the middle of the range of $6 to $6.50, ROIC adjusted of greater than 25%, North American margins of 10-plus percent, China equity income of about $2 billion, and we continue to project to return about $7 billion to shareholders as previously committed. This concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Our first question is going to come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Just on the results in North America, Chuck, hoping you could talk about how pickup trucks performed relative to other segments in terms of pickup truck variable profits, particularly as you prepare for the new launch in the next couple of years. How much of the resilience do you kind of attribute to the pickup truck segment relative to other segments in the company? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Good question, Itay, and I've talked about this before on some of these results, quarterly results. Number one, we've continued to hold our share and we view that as especially constructive given where we are in the lifecycle of that truck at about a 35% segment share. But more importantly, when you look at the actual data on kind of a same-store basis trim to trim, crew cab, extended cab, regular cab, on a variable profit basis, our margins are up calendar year-to-date in 2017 versus 2016. So, we've been able to continue to generate strong and improving variable margins as we move through the life cycle of this vehicle, and we would expect to see more of the same given the overall demand. We've taken actions over the last couple of years opportunistically from a price perspective. And clearly, that's paying off, and that's one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3% margins when you look at the significant production downtime we had in North America. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's helpful. And then just as we think about 2018 for North America, I think last quarter, Chuck, you alluded to kind of perhaps being able to maintain that zip code of 10% margins under accommodative macro conditions. Hoping you can update us on your kind of preliminary views for 2018 in North America. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I would say at this point in time, no update that is consistent. That view has not changed, In the current macro environment, our expectations is that we've built a business model especially when you consider our product launch cadence and the cost actions that we've been taking that will generate 10% margins in North America, and that's certainly what we're focused on executing. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And maybe if I could sneak in a quick product question. There's been a lot of talk, I think one of your competitors as well talked about looking to get more aggressive in the off-road category and some of the demand we're seeing for SUVs. And so just, as you kind of think about your product plans going forward, is there anything you can do as well to maybe attack those segments? And one thing maybe that comes to mind is the HUMMER that you used to have, and any opportunities for GM to penetrate some of these markets that some of your peers are talking about as well as you think about redesigning the new truck platform? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I think when you see the new truck platform come out both full-size truck and SUVs, you're going to see us having a broader portfolio that really addresses specific customer needs including from an off-road capability. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much, everyone. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Just one additional sort of follow-up on North America. I mean, Chuck, when you look at the 86.2% CapUt in North America versus the 8.3% EBIT margin and the wholesale drop of 26% in volume year-over-year, I mean it kind of looks like we went through sort of a shock test here on the downside in the cycle, yet you put up 8.3% margin. So, if you're old school and maybe I'm dating myself a little bit, if you thought about CapUt around 80%, you'd be breakeven and wholesale of decline of negative 26%, you'd be losing money. But you put up a big number here. I mean, is this the kind of thing that you think is repeatable or was there anything going in on the quarter that was an outsized benefit, it might not repeat in a shock like this again? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think clearly we've got a fundamentally restructured business model and we've been talking about that for the last number of years, maintaining a breakeven point at a SAAR level of 10 to 11 million units. And I think this is a proof point that that business model can withstand the kind of volume reduction that we've seen. Obviously, one of the big drivers of that is the significantly improved mix, not only full-size pickups and full-size SUVs but crossovers and the launch cadence associated with that. But I think interesting comparison would be to look at Q3 results of 2017 versus Q4 last year. In Q4 last year, 8.6% margins on wholesales and revenues that were significantly higher than Q3 this year. And again, that just demonstrates the resilience of the business model, the continued execution of our plan and fundamentally reinforces our breakeven point thesis that we've been talking about for the last number of years. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. That's very helpful. And then, Mary, I mean, as we think about sort of the execution of finally getting the European sale done here, I mean, could we hear about sort of a Cruise office opening in Paris, London and Berlin, and this mobility service business would be how you would attack or actually operate in Europe and it could be actually be a lot more profitable than what you've done historically? I mean, do you need a presence outside of \u2013 I mean, obviously you're getting away from manufacturing, but can you have a presence like that and actually operate there? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Oh, absolutely. We are going to be looking globally. We're working extremely hard on the technology to have self-driving vehicles and looking at it from a safety perspective, a performance perspective, but we're working hard to lead in that area, and then we're already evaluating what markets make the most sense to generate the most shareholder value. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And European markets are obviously on that list? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Absolutely. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly, on all the funding for your future car efforts, are they contemplated in your existing R&D and CapEx budgets, or are there any significant step-ups we should be thinking about in 2018, 2019 and beyond? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Generally, when we look at the capital spend that we'd had in the engineering spend, we are able to do the work that we want to do from AD perspective, and by the way an EV perspective and a connectivity perspective. We're going to continue to evaluate that, but our current view is that that largely is all included, because we've been driving a lot of efficiencies, especially in the capital budget. When we look at being able to reuse architectures, reuse equipment, and then also the synergies and the work that's going on in product development. So, we will evaluate because we don't want to be constrained by being able to fund. We know speed is important to get the first mover advantage. But right now, I'd say generally it's within those bounds. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just one quick follow up to that. Is there any need to do any more vertical M&A or integration like you did with Strobe on different parts for the AD each or do you feel like you have a lot of those puzzle pieces already? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah, I feel that we do have a lot of the puzzle pieces. We continue to look at it. This is a very dynamic and evolving marketplace. I think the real opportunity with Strobe is we saw an opportunity, also partnering with the work that we do at the Hughes Research Labs to look at that technology, how to really improve the capability of the technology which gives you the ability to open up the areas where you can do autonomous vehicle while taking the cost significantly out and really getting to an automotive-grade LIDAR capability. So we'll continue to evaluate. I don't have anything to share right now. But again, this is fast moving and we're going to look at what makes the most sense to allow us to go with speed, with safety, and to deliver value. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. We're looking forward to seeing these things in New York. Thanks so much. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: We are too. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. I'll start with some questions on today's business then follow up on the economists. Within North America, can you kind of dimension the walk a different way? Specifically, what was the drag from the downtime in cars, the downtime in pickup trucks versus the uptick from the crossovers and just how can we kind of gauge the impact of the crossovers in that GMNA EBIT? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Boy, really good question, Brian, but I'm not sure that I'm ready to break down volume and mix by segment within, I would say, the following. Here's the way to think about it. Our volumes were down roughly 250,000 units. Half of that was launch related, roughly. Of that, 50,000 were full-size trucks and 60,000 were CUVs. And then the balance was passenger cars. The planned piece of that was roughly half, which was the full-size trucks and the crossovers. Aligning supply and demand on cars was the other portion of that, roughly 100,000 units or so. And as you look at the number, obviously, the volume impact we talked about was $2.1 billion, but mix was favorable in the quarter, and that was largely reduction of passenger cars that drove that favorable mix. So hopefully, that helps dimension that a little bit. But as far as numerics associated with each of those moving pieces, not ready to share at that level of detail. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And pricing less materials for crossovers, I assume that's positive. Is that, I mean, put other ways, majors mostly the crossover launches? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Majors were the crossovers and carryover was largely passenger car driven, right, as that segment continues to be very, very competitive and as people shift away. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: And I would expect fourth quarter pricing to be favorable versus third quarter largely on the back of the crossover launches. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And how about the planned downtime for trucks? Are you through the CUV downtime and is IHS roughly accurate for the truck downtime or anything you could say around that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: What's the IHS number for next year? I mean, are you talking about 2018 or 2017? Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Well, 4Q 2017 and then into 2018. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would look at it like this. We expect Q4 production factory unit sales to be up versus Q3, roughly 150,000 units. We don't have any downtime on full-size trucks or SUVs. Actually, we expect versus Q3 to be up, production to be up on those segments. We will continue to make adjustments as appropriate on passenger cars. And when we look into next year, clearly, and we'll have more to say about this in January, but clearly there is incremental downtime in 2018 related to the truck launch. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And you'll probably talk this more about the Investor Day. But sort of a lot of talk in the press, analysts, around not just building autonomous cars but putting those into revenue producing shared autonomous ride-share service. Can you provide us any update on your preliminary thinking of that, kind of how the test with Cruise with their own employees are in terms of using, admittedly, human backup drivers and the timetable to taking the driver out? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, I don't have anything new to say. What we've talked about is it will be, first of all, will be gated by safety, so being able to take the driver out will \u2013 we have our metrics we defined to look at that and when we'll be ready to do that, but we think that's in quarters, not years. And as it relates to how we deploy, we very much believe we want to maintain the relationship with the customer. And so, we're exploring many options and we could partner with someone, partner with many or work on our own the Cruise application that is being used with our employees at Cruise is going quite well, in fact we have some of those people participating in their pilot that are using it for all of their transportation needs. So, it continues to \u2013 we continue to develop that, and we're keeping our options open. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Just following on that last question for the global mobility business. Can you envision a scenario where some of these partners invest in your mobility business? And is that something that maybe needed for certain markets such as China? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Certainly, that could be possible. We're keeping all options open. It's kind of in this point where the technology is evolving and the opportunity is evolving. We're having a lot of conversations, kind of everyone is talking to everyone. And we're going to continue to look at what provides us the greatest value for our shareholders over the long term because we think this is a very significant business that is accretive. And we're going to look to get \u2013 it gets gated by the technology and that's why our focus is on technology. The fact that we have everything under one roof and we can move so quickly. I mentioned that we have our third generation of vehicle \u2013 AD vehicle, test vehicle on the round, we're in parallel already working on our fourth. So, that speed with technology that is evolving so quickly, both from a hardware and a software perspective, is our primary focus. But then we're going to look to how do we launch and put a business model together that's most advantageous for our shareholders. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Interesting. And then just talking about the auto business, you mentioned that you're targeting 70 days of inventory at the end of the year in the U.S., and I think that that's lower than you had previously targeted. Is that an adjustment to your production expectations, maybe for the fourth quarter? And if it is lower production, is that the primary factor driving the decline in the free cash flow target for the year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I would say a couple of things, Rod. First, let's start with the nominal number because the day supply will be largely dependent on the sales rate in December. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So, our target is to be in the 70-day range. I think the more important number is the overall nominal number. And our view right now is we're going to be significantly lower at the end of 2017 versus the end of 2016. Just to dimension that, we had 850,000 units in dealer inventory at the end of 2016. We think that we'll be in the zip code of somewhere around 800,000. Importantly, within that, it will be better balanced. We expect to have roughly 80-day supply of trucks and SUVs which is normal for us, an appropriate level of crossovers, 60, 70 days of crossovers and somewhere in the zip code of 50 days of passenger cars as we work through that. I think that that is a good launch point as you think about 2018 to end the year with that kind of inventory level and that day supply. Built into our free cash flow forecast, obviously, there's continued rightsizing and aligning production. But there's also the impact that we have from the strike. At the end of the day, we lost 20,000 units in the strike that we had in Canada, which won't be made up and that has an impact on working capital and the timing. So, I think the adjustment of guidance from $7 billion to $6 billion is more about production timing, including the strike impact than overall earnings generation, obviously, since we've maintained our guidance. And I think, importantly, within that, though, is we still expect to distribute about $7 billion to shareholders and end the year in a strong cash and liquidity position. So, very, very consistent overall when you look at those parameters. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And could you clarify \u2013 you were asked about this earlier \u2013 what's the magnitude of the production downtime year-over-year that you're expecting for trucks in 2018? And as we look out to 2019, I think it seems like you should be benefiting from the truck launch, as well as the GEM's platform launch. Any just preliminary thoughts on how we should be thinking about the longer term? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would look at this broadly speaking because it's early days and we always are evaluating the best ways to optimize the downtime and everything else. But I would say, overall, there'll be less downtime in 2018 versus 2017 overall, significantly less, but trucks will be more. And whether that's four weeks or five weeks or six weeks, we will look towards optimizing that. So, it's hard for me to sit there and say it's going to be X thousands of units at this point in time because, clearly, we want to be able to minimize the impact. Once we get through the launch of the first \u2013 remember, the T1 launch will go for a couple of years as we work our way through that very broad portfolio, but I think the biggest portion of that will be next year, and we'll get that full benefit in 2019. We'll also be well on our way of the GEM launch, which will favorably impact South America and China. I don't want to provide guidance on 2019 yet, Rod. It's a little bit early. But, certainly, when you look at launch cadence, the benefit of the full-size truck launch, continued cost execution, again, in this broad macro environment, I see no reason why you shouldn't continue to see us progress towards our 10% margin objective in the core business. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe firstly on South America, I see that you're making money there at lower volumes than in past periods when you lost money. Just a couple of questions there. Firstly, does the cost reduction there put you on any better footing structurally such that you could earn higher profits when the volume normalizes? And then secondly, are the operations there now anymore flexible so that the next time there is another sharp downturn that you could maybe avoid the same degree of losses that you experienced in this last down cycle? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think yes and yes is the answer to that, Ryan. Thanks for the question. I mean, fundamentally, we've reduced our breakeven point in South America by 40% versus the prior peak not only in South America but importantly in Brazil. And you're seeing that play out in the results that we've started to put on the board the last two quarters where there was a minor recovery at least directionally, a minor recovery in the market and we're highly leveraged to that upside. So, we're constructive about the market in South America, the continued improvement in the market in South America, and layer on top of that, the global emerging market portfolio when you talked about flexibility. 90% of our volume will come from that architecture by 2020 in South America, which means huge scale benefit across multiple product entries produced largely in our low-cost facility in Gravata\u00ed and we've shifted more of our production there out of S\u00e3o Paulo which is higher cost within the country to Gravata\u00ed. So, fundamentally, across the board the team in South America has done an exceptional job running kind of the same playbook we ran in North America back in seven or eight years ago on rightsizing the business, driving more flexibility from a cost structure perspective. And if you look at some of the advances and benefits they've got from the labor negotiations well out in front of the competition, building more flexibility around that, the ability to take people out and do it without a lot of, I would say, speed bumps along the way with our labor partners there makes it a much more dynamic and resilient business model. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then, just lastly from me on the improvement also in the consolidated international operations. Firstly, did 3Q benefit already from some of the actions that you announced on the call last quarter such as the sale of some of the African operations or wind-down of domestic sales in India or are those savings yet to come? Secondly, I think you just ended assembly in Australia, how to think about the sequential improvement in 4Q and 1Q? And then, thirdly, there has been some discussion in the Korean press about possible changes to your operations there. What are the options on the table relative to Korea and how much of a profit improvement might you be able to drive for the investors there? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Wait. Those were a lot of questions in one sentence, Ryan. Let me see if I can remember them all. In the GM consolidated operations, the restructurings that we took which were India domestic business, exiting South Africa and fundamentally winding down the headquarters, we said that that was going to be a run-rate benefit of about $100 million a year on a go-forward basis. There was obviously a portion of it that impacted Q3, but not materially. I think most of that you're going to see in 2018 as we wind down and exit those operations. Australia manufacturing, we've been on kind of that path of starting to reduce production, but if you just think about a typical facility, I would think that on a year-over-year basis that's a $115 million a year benefit, given the level of production. We're only producing the Commodore in Australia. So, I would expect to see that wind through, all else equal, in 2018. Obviously, our objective with all the actions we've taken in those markets is to drive that business to profitability. And slow going thus far, but we're starting to get some traction, and you saw it in the third quarter, and we've got more to go. Relative to Korea, that is a challenging market for us. We have a strong presence there. We have a strong brand there, a healthy market share, but the cost structure there not only for us, but the overall industry in Korea, has grown to where it's not sustainable. And we're going to have to take action there on a go-forward basis to address that, to build a viable sustainable business. And I would say more to come on that. Clearly, there's challenges there with our labor partners, a very, very dynamic and challenging environment to get things done, but we've got a strategy that we're starting to execute, and like I said, I think more to come on that as it progresses. It's just too early to talk about it right now. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for all that color. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, everybody. I just have one question and one follow-up. The first is on the GM International kind of creation. Understand the logic of using this opportunity to kind of change the transparency in the reporting structure, but does this signal a deeper strategic shift to kind of think of all of GM's non-U.S. businesses together, not just for reporting purposes, but in terms of, let's say, architecture and strategy? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Absolutely. First was the combination from a reporting responsibility perspective under Barry Engle. And he is now responsible or will be responsible for South America and GM International markets. Obviously, the reporting is a manifestation, the external reporting is a manifestation of that structure once it's in place January 1. But fundamentally, the strategy is to take advantage of our GEM architecture and our presence in these markets to optimize across all of these businesses. So, there's clearly a strategic aspect of this, as well as an external reporting to align with the strategy. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thanks, Chuck. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Adam, Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, Mary? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I was just going to add that when you look at going back to what Chuck said about South America, Barry Engle and his team have done a great job of setting that business up in a even more cyclical business. And so, looking at that and taking that leadership team and looking at all of those business together is definitely going to be a benefit, and Barry is the right guy to do it. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, Mary. And, Mary, just a follow-up for you. OEMs everywhere seem to be kind of creating these new legal entities where they house kind of their future auto, new tech or new business models. I think you alluded to one of the benefits in your comments earlier, Mary, about being able to move very quickly in the speed of tech. But if I just back up for a moment, how would you describe the pros and the cons to potentially creating a separately seated legal entity, whether it's publicly traded or not, but just that kind of separation of an auto 2.0 business? Kind of what are the pros and cons in addition to the speed of tech under one roof that you could add? Thanks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. I think we've already been transparent in what we're reporting from in the Corp segment and been clear about the amount of money that we're spending on autonomous. But I think when we look it, our focus, Adam, right now is to move as quick as possible to develop the technology, have a first mover advantage and be able to not only have the safest technology, but be able to deploy it at scale. That's where our focus is right now. And there's the integration and not when you \u2013 depending on how you would separate it of where is IP, where is IP formed, right now, that's why our focus is keeping it all together. And I really do think it's enabling us to move quickly. The amount of work that goes on between Warren, Israel, Canada and San Francisco on a daily basis is stunning. And the fact that we're working on our fourth generation, that's where our focus is right now. And I think we'll have time to look at it as that develops and as the business model develops, what is the best reporting and structure from a company perspective to drive the best shareholder value. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mary. I appreciate it. Operator : And our final question for the day will come from the line of David Tamberrino, Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking our questions back here. First one, just you just recently released the Super Cruise business or product on your Cadillacs, and it was delayed, I don't know, one and a half, maybe two years. What's the difference from that technology that did see about a year or two delay to your bullish tone that you've been putting out on your AD solution where you think you're going to be coming obviously faster to market than anyone else? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, Super Cruise, which you're correct that we did delay because we were gated by safety. There's a lot of learning that went into that system. And it's the base that the core organization has that is now the Cruise Automation team is benefiting from of safety, of redundancy, of looking at the \u2013 one of the technologies was critically important. Super Cruise is the way we monitor the driver to make sure that they're paying attention. And so, all those learnings go into Cruise. And then \u2013 but as I look at that and I look at where the schedule we put ourselves on Cruise and how the technology is developing, I continue to be very forward-leaning on that with the work that I see happening there, and all the learnings we had from Super Cruise are transferring into Cruise Automation. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then, two last ones. Chuck, I think you mentioned this in the comments but, for residuals, did you say that you're expecting headwinds in the fourth quarter for GMF from residual values in used car pricing? Can you elaborate on that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Sure. We've been talking about, through the year, that we expected used car pricing to be a headwind in the year, and it fundamentally would manifest itself in the second half of the year. We didn't see it as much in the third quarter. We had talked about 7% year-over-year. I think with the recovery that we had seen already starting a lower year-over-year decline in the latter part of the second quarter and the third quarter somewhat impacted by hurricane issues that we see less than 7% at this point in time for the year, but still a headwind. And when you think about the timing of the depreciation and everything else, most of that is going to impact Q4 from that perspective. And that 's consistent with what we've been talking about all year long. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's fair. In the quarter, did you see a benefit to your residual values as a result of the hurricane? And, again, as of September, I mean, how much of that increased selling rate in September really helped to lower your inventories for the quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: First, on the first question, I think the improvement that we saw in used car values in the third quarter, if anything, just delayed the mark-to-market that we're going to see in the fourth quarter as we continue to see used car pricings moderate. So, I wouldn't say there was a headwind. There was an absence of a \u2013 I wouldn't say there was a tailwind, there was an absence of a headwind in the third quarter when you think about GMF results. And on your second question, relative to inventory, the biggest driver of the inventory reduction was the production adjustments. Obviously, as we think about our plan for the year and everything else, we've built in a sales forecast that goes into that. Certainly, a 18.5 million light SAAR in September helped with that on the margin, probably 15,000, 20,000 units in the month of September overall, but not a big driver of that 160,000 unit inventory reduction. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then my final question on corporate expenses. It was a lot lower than what we were forecasting. I think the slide deck mentioned a couple of favorable non-recurring gains. Could you just elaborate on what those were for the quarter? And we should be going back up $400 million or not? Unknown Speaker : Yeah. We will be going back up to the $400 million to $500 million range. I think importantly, within the numbers that we reported in Q3, we spent something north of $160 million on AV. And we'll continue to spend at that pace, that $600 million to $700 million pace that we've been talking about. In Q3, we had the benefit of some non-recurring gains related to the PSA transaction. Primarily, the mark-to-market on the PSA warrants that were part of the transaction and the movement in Peugeot stock price. And that was the biggest driver of that. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the conference over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, thanks, everybody. I appreciate you participating today. I hope that you see we're demonstrating that we are a very disciplined organization, that we're going to take the bold actions and make the tough decisions to drive a profitable business and a very resilient core business. Also, we are committed moving with speed and we're going to continue to invest in EV, AD because we see huge opportunity in the future of personal mobility. We are intent on leading the transformation of this industry, and we have created a vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion that we believe is the future for this industry. We are in a leadership position and we think it is the best way to generate long-term shareholder value and you will hear more as we move forward. So, thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We do thank you for your participation and ask that you disconnect your lines.",

Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, February 6, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us, as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. We will then open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, Vice President, Global Business Solutions (sic) [Global Business Services], Controller and Chief Accounting Officer; and Rick Westenberg, Vice President and Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Dhivya. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining. 2017 was a transformative year for GM. The very strong results we reported this morning demonstrate the earnings power of our core business and extend our track record of meeting our commitments. Let's look at the full year results. Our EBIT adjusted of $12.8 billion repeats 2016's record performance. We had a record EBIT adjusted margin of 8.8%, and record EPS diluted adjusted of $6.62. We returned $6.7 billion in cash to shareholders, and our return on invested capital adjusted was 28% on a trailing four quarter basis. GM begins this year as stronger, more resilient company because of the decisive actions we have taken in the past few years to : first, reshape our business; second, to focus on higher return opportunities; and third, invest in technologies that enable our vision of a future with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We plan to continue our momentum in 2018 and position the company to accelerate further in 2019. This year, we expect continued strength in North America where, in 2017, we achieved a record EBIT adjusted margin. We expect improved results in GM International where we saw strong equity income in China and return to profitability in South America. We expect momentum from a full year sales of new crossovers and, later, our all-new full-size pickups, and we expect improved performance by adjacent businesses including GM Financial, and of course, we'll maintain a very strong cost efficiency focus across the entire business. Chuck will share additional details in a few minutes. In the core business, where a strong mix of winning vehicles helped drive another outstanding year in 2017, in the U.S. specifically, GM was the pickup truck sales leader for the fourth year in a row. Chevrolet grew retail shares for the third consecutive year, and we became the fastest-growing crossover company in the industry with retail share up 1.6 percentage points. Building on the success of our refreshed crossovers will be the 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup, which go on sale later this year; and also the global launch of the Cadillac XT4 luxury Caddy CUV crossover. With GM International, GM China delivered a year of record sales led by Buick and Baojun, and our luxury brand Cadillac, which grew 51%. To continue this momentum, GM China will introduce 15 new or refreshed models including seven SUVs and crossovers this year. Finally, in South America, Chevrolet continued its market leadership, where sales rose 13.8% last year. In addition to great products, we are strengthening our performance through cost efficiencies that offset incremental investments in the business. We are on track for our commitment to achieve $6.5 billion in efficiencies by the end of this year on the 2014 baseline, and we'll continue that focus on costs beyond 2018. In addition, we are making remarkable progress in advancing our vision for the future of personal mobility. This year, we expect to increase our investment in transportation as a service initiative to $1 billion. Last month, we filed a safety report that is available on GM.com and a safety petition with the U.S. Department of Transportation to allow us to safely deploy our fourth-generation self-driving Cruise AV. It is the first production-ready vehicle built to operate safely with no driver, no steering wheel, no pedals or manual control. The Cruise AV is another milestone on our path to deploying self-driving vehicles in a ride-sharing environment in 2019. To advance our vision of a zero emissions world, we also announced the General Motors will introduce at least 20 new all-electric models by 2023. As we continue to make meaningful progress and lowering battery costs, we are confident that our next-generation EV architecture will be desirable, attainable and profitable with a range that our customers want. We will begin unveiling these vehicles in 2021. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chuck to share additional details. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. I'd like to give some perspective on the quarter and provide additional insights into our 2018 outlook. Our strong fourth quarter results kept another record year of earnings as we met our commitments for the fourth year in a row. EBIT adjusted for the year of more than $12.8 billion repeats 2016's record performance, and we delivered a record margin of 8.8%, despite significant volume and commodity headwinds. We also achieved a record $6.62 in EPS diluted adjusted. Net revenue was $145.6 billion, down 2.4% from 2016 as we right-sized dealer inventories in the United States. Our strong results for the year were driven by a record North American margin of 10.7%. This was achieved even with wholesales being down more than 10% versus 2016 and flat versus 2015. In addition to the record margin in North America, GM Financial generated record earnings before taxes. And within GM International, China sustained its strong equity income, and we returned to profitability in South America. Turning to the fourth quarter, we generated $37.7 billion in net revenue, a record $3.1 billion in EBIT adjusted, and delivered $1.65 in EPS diluted adjusted. In the fourth quarter, North America generated $2.9 billion of EBIT adjusted, a Q4 record and an increase of $200 million year-over-year. We generated these strong earnings off $28.8 billion of revenue, resulting in another quarter of 10-plus percent margins for North America and leading to our third straight year of 10% or higher margins. Volume continued to be a headwind the fourth quarter, with wholesales down 135,000 units on a year-over-year basis as we reduced our U.S. dealer inventory as planned. We ended the year with 63-days supply and 753,000 units of dealer inventory, down 8 days and 92,000 units from the end of 2017, both far surpassing the targets we committed to early last year. We generated the record results in North America, despite the decline in volume and an increase in raw material costs of about $200 million in the fourth quarter through improved mix, pricing, and cost performance. Both our fourth quarter and calendar year performance demonstrate the resiliency of our North American business. For the calendar year, the North America team delivered EBIT-adjusted of $11.9 billion with a record 10.7% margin even with a 447,000 unit decline in wholesales and $600 million of commodity headwinds. And pricing remained strong. Our U.S. average transaction prices continued to grow, despite increased industry-wide incentive spend and a slightly weaker industry volume. Our fourth quarter ATPs of about $37,000 were $1,500 higher than the fourth quarter of 2016. The underlying strength of our business continues to improve as actions we have taken to reduce our fleet sales, improve residual values, and drive cost performance are playing out favorably in our results. Moving to GM International, this is the first quarter for our new reporting segment which combines the former GMIO region with the former GM South America region. Overall, EBIT-adjusted for this segment improved $200 million year-over-year driven by cost and price improvements. South America continued to improve. The fourth quarter was the second straight profitable quarter resulting in breakeven for the year, and we anticipate continued improvement in 2018. China continues to deliver solid results with equity income of $2 billion for the full year, about equal to 2016. A few comments on GM Financial and our Corp segment. As we continue to progress towards full captive, GM Financial posted record revenue of $3.3 billion and record earnings before tax adjusted of $300 million in the fourth quarter. Earnings assets grew 25% to about $86 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth, and we anticipate continued earnings growth in 2018. In the Corporate segment, costs were about $500 million for the fourth quarter and about $1.5 billion for the full year. This was in line with our expected costs for the year. As discussed at the Deutsche Bank Conference, spend on transportation and service is expected to increase about $400 million in 2018 versus 2017 as we prepare to deploy self-driving vehicles in a ride-share environment in 2019. As a result, we expect the Corporate sector quarterly cost to run in the $500 million to $600 million range for 2018. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, Q4 adjusted automotive free cash flow improved by $1.7 billion year-over-year primarily due to favorable working capital as a result of normalization of production from the third quarter of 2017, partially offset by the impact of reduced dealer inventory. Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the full year of 2017 was $5.2 billion, down $3 billion year-over-year primarily due to lower automotive EBIT-adjusted of $400 million and movements in dealer inventory levels and the resulting impact on sales incentives of $2.2 billion. As Mary mentioned, we returned $6.7 billion to our shareholders through $2.2 billion in dividends and $4.5 billion in stock repurchases through 2017. And as a result of our strategic sale of Opel/Vauxhall, we were able to reduce our cash target by $2 billion. This is reflected in our year-end cash balance which is $2 billion lower than the 2016 year-end cash balance. Now, I want to share more details on our 2018 outlook. As we outlined last month, we expect to deliver full year 2018 EPS diluted adjusted in the mid-$6 range. We expect core EBIT-adjusted and core automotive adjusted free cash flow to be largely in line with core business performance in 2017. Core results consist of all operations excluding our autonomous vehicle operations, including Cruise Automation, Maven, and our investment in Lyft. Core automotive free cash flow will likely remain flat in 2018 as GM North American production levels and ending dealer inventory are expected to be relatively flat. Capital spending, as I said last month, will be about $8.5 billion for 2018, and we expect our annual run rate to decline as we get past our next-generation truck launch. Looking at 2018 cadence, we expect Q1 and Q4 to be the weakest quarters driven by typical seasonality, as well as our retooling downtime related to our new full-size pickup trucks. We expect Q2 and Q3 to be the strongest. North America will be impacted in Q1 by an approximately 60,000 unit volume decline primarily due to truck downtime. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our weakest cash flow quarter due to working capital seasonality. Given the anticipated lower production I just mentioned as well as CapEx spend to support the truck launch, Q1 cash flow is expected to be meaningfully below our historical averages. Our pace of buybacks for 2018 will be dependent on our free cash flow generation, our quarterly dividend which will remain at $0.38, and any additional calls on cash throughout the year. In North America, we expect to sustain an EBIT-adjusted margin of 10%-plus primarily due to continued strength of the U.S. industry, favorable mix due to a full year of new crossovers, the launch of our all-new full-size trucks, and a continued focus on overall cost savings. In GM International, we see improvement in 2018 driven primarily by the continued strengthening of our business in South America. In China, we see a similar dynamic as in 2017 and the past few years : continued pricing pressure offset by a richer mix of crossovers and anchored by strong sales from Buick and growing sales from Baojun and Cadillac resulting in another year of strong equity income. In Korea, we've had recent discussions with key stakeholders regarding the need to improve Korea's financial and operational performance. As we strategically assess our performance, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required. More to come on this topic as we move through the year. We see a significant opportunity for growth in adjacencies in 2018, specifically GM Financial, where we expect to once again improve earnings. Globally, while we expect a continued increase in raw material prices, we currently expect to largely mitigate through other cost performance. So to sum it up, a record fourth quarter, another record year of profit, margins and EPS diluted adjusted in 2017 in the face of significant volume declines and commodity headwinds. And our organization is focused on meeting our commitments again in 2018, as we've done for the last four years. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for taking the question. I guess just to level set everyone, your core EBIT and core free cash flow, which you were saying flat in 2018, those metrics are about $13.5 billion, and just a shade under $6 billion on free cash flow? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That would be the math when you look at what we delivered in 2017 and adjust for the investment in AV. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. And the $300 million increase in AV and mobility that you're pointing to in 2018, is that the level that you think gets you ready to launch at scale in the first quarter of 2019, or should we expect a step-up in the quarter you actually go live? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would say it's $400 million roughly, from $600 million to $1 billion on AV itself, $700 million to $1.1 billion overall in the TAS (17:22) segment when you factor in Maven and some of the other activities. But specific to AV, it's $600 million to $1 billion, Joe. And that's the run rate for 2018. That's what we think we need to spend in order to continue on that path, and we'll have more to say about 2019, as we exit through 2018. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And last one, just \u2013 because you mentioned some of the adjacency growth in GM Financial, and clearly, there's \u2013 I know there's a lot of economic factors that go into the forecast, but there's been a more recent focus on rates. Do you feel confident with that on a reasonable range of rate outcomes for 2018? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, clearly our expectations for \u2013 or maybe not so, but I'll make it clear now. Our expectations for 2018 were based on a set of assumptions from a macro perspective. Here specific in the U.S., it was an environment where there are going to be moderate increases in interest, 75 basis points, moderate inflation, moderate wage growth, continued GDP growth and an industry that was going to be in the low 17 millions. Under that construct, we would expect the growth in GM Financial as indicated, as well as another strong year in North America with 10-plus percent margins. And that's our baseline assumption, and that's what we're executing to at this point. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Just wanted \u2013 could you give a little more color on the puts and takes for your GM North America EBIT in 2018? So I guess if we maybe refer to the typical bucket that you're reporting it in the slide, how should we think about those puts and takes for this year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So, you're looking for an EBIT bridge, Emmanuel. So I'll give you kind of a high-level view, because we kind of paint at the macro backdrop. So the way I think about it and going back to the Deutsche Bank Conference, and look at from a tailwinds and a headwinds perspective, clearly, as we think about 2018 headwinds \u2013 and it's global, but obviously a big component of North America \u2013 commodity prices are going to increase, pricing is going to continue to be challenging in the carryover space, and we expect a lower industry. And then we've got the added specific issue in North America as we talked about of the incremental truck downtime roughly 60,000 units. To generate 10% margins in North America and offset some of those tailwinds \u2013 or headwinds, we have the full-year impact of our crossover launches, specifically the mid crossovers \u2013 Traverse, Enclave and Equinox \u2013 and we think that's going to be a pretty significant tailwind from a pricing perspective. We expect volume to be relatively flat year-over-year, but mix will be a headwind because of the lower truck production. And we expect cost performance to be favorable as we've demonstrated over the last couple of years with commercial and technical savings in GPSC and further SG&A efficiencies more than offsetting the incremental impact of commodities and launch-related costs. So, that's kind of the broad buckets. Obviously, as we've done over the last number of years, that's the baseline plan. And as we go through the year, we will make adjustments and course correct in order to continue to execute towards that objective, again contextually within the macro environment that I described earlier. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : That's helpful. And I guess specifically within GMNA pricing, do you see any risk of just increased competitive conditions on the truck side? I mean, I understand on the crossover side, you have new product. But I guess on the pickup truck side, it seems like conditions are getting extremely competitive. I guess what is the directional assumption in your guidance for that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would say, broadly speaking, we will have favorable pricing on new major, primarily driven by the full year of the crossovers and then the launch of the new truck later in the year. And there'll be a headwind, as we've seen over the last few years, on carryover pricing. As you know, incentive spend continues to amp up. But I would say, in that context, we still think truck pricing is going to be reasonably constructive. And just one data point, if you look at truck pricing transaction prices, say, Q4 versus Q3 in 2017, from a segment perspective, they were up another $1,000 a unit from a transaction pricing perspective. We were down slightly given the age of our truck, and we've built that into our plan as we go through 2018. So on balance, we feel reasonably good about truck pricing. Certainly, we're looking forward to the next-generation truck which we think is going to be a significant tailwind for us. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Maybe a question on the strength of the pickup truck franchise, but I'll ask it in a different way. Chuck, if I look at your guidance of kind of mid-$6 EPS, and I remove the $1 billion of Cruise AV investments, would it be fair to say that kind of all else equal, GM could still earn $6-plus in a, call it, high 15 million light vehicle SAAR. How can you think about the sensitivity now to the SAAR given what we've seen in terms of the pickup truck variable profits for yourselves and the industry? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good question, Itay. So, the basic math would be, if we're in a 16 million industry versus 17 million, our wholesales are going to come down roughly 200,000 units, right? So 200,000 units at our average variable profit, the math would suggest that we would be north of $6 EPS in that environment for sure. I mean, it's a reasonably easy math exercise. I think the key is how that develops, right, and how that 17 million to 16 million industry develops, because there's other factors that would come in play; what's the pricing environment as you're going down in aggregate, what's the mix. But I would say that that's how we're trying to position this business. I've always talked about North American EBIT margins of 10%, and building a business model that would sustain that in a mid-15 million to low-16 million range and that's what we've been progressing to. And I would say the resilience of the business model last year would suggest that. We're kind of wholesaling or producing at a SAAR level that was less than 17.6 million when you look at our year-over-year volume decline. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. And just my follow-up. On the $1.5 billion of adjacent profit growth, I think for 2021, can you just share the cadence around that? How much might you be seeing this year and how much might that be contributing to your expectation of earnings improvement in 2019? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would say that without providing specifics over that kind of direction, where we're going to see and what we said back in January was a significant improvement in 2018, primarily GM Financials, as we continue on the captive. And then, we'll leg in the benefits in aftersales and OnStar as we go through kind of the 2019 to 2021 timeframe. The aftersales will be driven by continued growth in the car park after we bottomed out kind of in 2016, troughed out and then continue to increase our service loyalty, and OnStar is just continuing the growth of 4G LTE and some of the other related opportunities for revenue growth from that perspective. So, long answer. Simple answer is most of that improvement is going to come in GMF in 2018, and then between the three of them, kind of leg that in 2019 to 2021. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a good quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Any color \u2013 you've talked in the past about small cars losing money. Any update there in terms of maybe turning those around that could be the only area that is underperforming, I guess, and is it still losing money? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Last year, we had a focus and we took several actions to improve the overall performance across our car portfolio. Although, as you saw the shifts in the market, significant pressure on cars especially in the U.S. So, we continue to look for opportunities. We are well positioned though when you look at the fact that it was in the 2015 timeframe when we invested in and launched the compact and the mid-size with the Chevrolet Cruise and the Malibu. So we're well positioned with those being very robust architectures to continue to respond to the marketplace with very little capital investment as we move forward. I'd also say if you look broader globally from a car perspective, when we start to launch GEM in the 2019 timeframe, I think that sets us up very well especially in emerging markets, Mexico, China and South America to have a very strong car platform and really reach into the marketplace where customers are focused. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And any color on the size of the raw material headwind that is based on your guidance in terms of number? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, I mean, just to put it in perspective, last year, when we look at it in aggregate on a year-over-year basis, it was in the $700 million ZIP code. I think our baseline planning assumption is something a little bit less than that in 2018. So, roughly speaking, call it, $400 million to $500 million. But I think the important point is, as we see that develop, obviously, we were able to offset that impact last year through really strong performance across all other cost drivers. And we will react as we see how this develops during the year. But again for baseline planning assumptions, call it in the ZIP code of a $0.5 billion or so. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just one last question, how should we think about the uses of free cash flow this year? I think you indicated in your comment that would be about flat year-over-year. Do you think the majority of the excess cash will be used to repurchases? Or should we model it in that way or do you need more de-leveraging? Any thoughts there? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think that our capital allocation framework is relatively transparent. We've been executing to it with discipline over the last number of years. So our guidance is flat free cash flow year-over-year in the core business. So call it roughly, ex-TAS (28:57) $6 billion, with TAS (28:58) roughly $5 billion, and we pay dividends, so that will be $2.2 billion. That will leave $2.8 billion for other actions. Other actions being M&A, not that I'm suggesting there's anything on the radar, but that's what that's for and/or restructuring and/or share buybacks. And I would say, as we go through the year, you would start with a $2.8 billion kind of opportunity for share buybacks and we'll see what develops. But to the extent that we have free cash flow available, that's what we're going to do. We're going to buy back shares. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Hey. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I hate to beat the dead horse here, just kind of staying on North America for a second. But when we look at it, the performance in the second half of the year has been pretty remarkable with volumes down and margins incredibly strong and actually in the fourth quarter up. I'm just curious, as you look at the market, I mean, the two levers that you've been able to pull is product launches and strong mix and the second one is cost cutting. So I'm just thinking, as you look at sort of your product cadence going forward, do you think there's an opportunity to upsell consumers into products that are better for them at higher prices and higher variable margins? Do you think you can kind of clip off another 5-point move towards crossover? Just kind of how you're thinking about that upselling opportunity. And then also, how much further you have to go on cost cutting in North America to potentially offset any weakness or create just absolute upside to earnings going forward? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Let me focus on trucks, John, because we spent a fair amount of time talking about that at the Deutsche Bank Conference. While we've done very well with the current truck franchise, we think there's significant upside with the next-generation because we've released a number of constraints that we've had that will allow us to drive richer mix. The Silverado, we will have eight very distinct models that will cover the breadth of the portfolio, including up level where the current truck has really underperformed. We've also eliminated the constraint on crew cab mix that we've had. We underperformed versus the market on crew cab mix, and I think we talked about in general a $2 billion opportunity for revenue growth just by releasing those constraints. So that's an example of something that we're executing. We're executing with the next-generation truck. I'd also say that as we think about the overall truck, not only are we releasing some of these constraints and have a broader product offering, there is going to be significant differentiation between the Silverado and the very premium Sierra, and we're going to continue to focus on that and we think that's going to provide upside as well as the Denali mix that has been very favorable to us. And I think you'll continue to see that focus on differentiation when we launch the heavy-duties as well as the SUV. So, very, very purposefully, as we did the full-size truck pickup, we're trying to address some of the challenges we've had over the number of years to really drive the best possible mix and profitability. And we think \u2013 I think we solved that with this truck that we're going to start launching later in 2018. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Chuck, just to clarify, the $2 billion revenue opportunity, that does not include the HDs? Or does that include the HDs as well? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That was \u2013 that was on LDs, just looking at crew-cab mix. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: So, a high-level number, John, right? But if you just look at our penetration or our average transaction prices versus kind of the segment leader and that opportunity and we think that we can close 75% of that just by releasing the constraint on crew-cab mix. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And I got to imagine that's got pretty high variable margins? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: It does. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. Yeah. Then a second question. Mary, I mean, I think a lot of us here in New York and even in the investment community are looking at the potential launch of a test fleet of Cruise vehicles here in New York City this year. I'm just curious where that stands as far as the launch and what we should be looking forward to hopefully for an event, an investor event around it. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, we are on track and proceeding to be able to launch in a geo-fenced ride-sharing environment autonomous vehicles in the 2019 timeframe. Clearly, the focus continues to be on the development we're doing in San Francisco because of the complexity of that environment and the learnings that we get and the speed of learnings that we get from San Francisco. We are in the process of mapping New York, and I don't have anything specific to share of when we'll actually have a fleet deployed, but we are on that path as we announced last year and we'll continue. But I'd say the primary focus is on San Francisco. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly real quick. Chuck, when we look at the GMF dividend, it looks like it went in reverse from the ParentCo to the GMF $600 million in the fourth quarter. What's going on there? And when can we expect to see sort of the more traditional dividend up from the FinCo to the ParentCo develop and, I mean, when will that occur? And should we looking at $1 billion size out in 2019 or 2020 when GMF matures? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. The dividend came from GMF to the parent in 2017. It was not included in our free cash flow numbers. It was related to the transaction of divesting our FinCo in Europe. And as you looked at the proceeds and the leverage ratios and everything else, they had the capacity to dividend about half of the proceeds to us, which we did. Again, that's not captured in the free cash flow number for 2017, obviously, in liquidity. Relative to long term \u2013 I think good question, John, and I think I would think about it in the context of our view on long-term cash generation capabilities of the company. Clearly, where we sit right now, pretty heavy CapEx load with the next-generation truck, incremental investment in AV, we're in the ZIP code of $5 billion to $6 billion of free cash flow. As you think beyond the next couple years in this kind of environment, we think our cash generation capability increases significantly. A couple of drivers to that. One, we'll be cycling past our high capital spend, and as we've indicated, we expect capital spend to come down. And two, we're going to at some point in time start to get the benefit of dividends from GM Financial, and I would say stay tuned on that. We'll have more to say as we get closer to that, but that is certainly part of our go-forward kind of plan relative to cash and cash flow and enhancing the overall cash generation of the business. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks. Just two questions. First, you've made some really bold moves, your team on rationalizing and exiting businesses where the chances of generating a positive return on capital are really, really remote. Obviously, Europe's being the biggest and most significant of that. So as you assess the portfolio today, are there still some either product areas or regions, and I guess I'm thinking Korea, although I won't say Korea, that areas where really you maybe couldn't justify being in long-term? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, if you look at it, I mean, I think we have a track record of demonstrating that we're going to look at, to your point, those segments and regions and/or countries and look at our ability to generate the right returns over a long period of time. Clearly, Korea is a challenge for us. We have a strong presence there. We've grown market share. The brand has \u2013 Chevrolet brand has done well. But the current cost structure has become challenging, and we're going to have to take actions going forward to have a viable business. We've already begun conversations with the key stakeholders in GM Korea, including our minority owners and the union, and being very clear that we need to improve the financial and operating performance. So we're right in the middle of having those conversations. We know, within Korea and there's a few other countries, where we have to look at, that we're going to take the steps necessary to have the right franchise going forward that may result in some rationalization actions or restructuring that potentially could have a material impact on our results. But it's too soon to tell right now. We're right in the middle of the conversations to make sure everybody, all the stakeholders, understand the steps we need to take. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mary. And you mentioned a few other countries. Any of these countries outside of Asia or could you be more specific? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I would say primarily in our GMI operations. But I would say Korea is the one that we're most focused on, the others I think would be less significant. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. All right. And then my second and final question on the robo-taxi fleet, can you \u2013 a bit of a round numbers are helpful here. How many Level 4, Level 5 vehicles does GM have on the road in their testing fleet right now? How many would you expect by year end and maybe an order of magnitude for 2019? I asked that question because it's important for us to kind of put to your guidance some transparency on the amount of money you're putting towards it to try to think of it on a unit basis, to kind of have an understanding of the size of your footprint. So if you could help us with it, that would be appreciated. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Right now, we have about 100 vehicles that are driving primarily Gen 2, Gen 3. And so, that's where our focus. That will be growing through the course of this year. Remember where we talked about when we were together in the fall, getting to a point where we're collecting a million miles per month and so we're on that path to get there throughout this year. Beyond that, we haven't sized it and that is something that we'll share more as we get through this year and into the 2019 timeframe. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You mentioned in the slides that you've now achieved by the end of 2017, $5.5 billion of the $6.5 billion cumulative cost saves targeted through 2018. These savings, I think they started in 2015. So I guess like 75% of the savings period has elapsed and you've now realized 85% of the targeted savings. So, is the takeaway that the cost savings continue but at accelerated pace or maybe that \u2013 and if history is any guide, since you've increased the number a couple of times, there could be some upside in 2018 to that $6.5 billion number? Do you think if there there's some incremental pressures in 2018, like higher than anticipated commodity prices that you might be able to push a little bit further on cost to try to offset that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I'd say first, when we first rolled out this objective, it was at $5.5 billion. And as we overachieved it last year, early last year is when we raised it to $6.5 billion. Importantly, just to level set that this is primarily commercial savings, SG&A and manufacturing which we've said would more than offset the incremental investment in marketing, engineering and D&A. And what we like to do is achieve the commitments that we make and then move from there. So, clearly, we are very focused on achieving the $6.5 billion that we committed to back in 2015. Clearly, we believe there's opportunities above and beyond that that we're going to continue to pursue. And once we hit the $6.5 billion, we will set the next objective for ourselves, because I do believe there is, and so does Mary, further opportunities beyond that. And I'd also say, Ryan, that if you look at last year and look at the EBIT bridges that we sent, you'll see pretty significant, across the board, cost performance outside of these buckets as well. So we had significant improvement and warranty, driven by improved quality, reduced recalls, all the things that we talked about back in 2014, and we are really focused on that. So more to come, but first, we're going to get the $6.5 billion commitment in the bag. And then, I'm quite sure that we'll have more to say on above and beyond that. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then, Chuck, I think I heard you say that there would be a 60,000-unit headwind in truck volume in the first quarter due to the changeover to the new pickups, which I think was a little surprising because the launch doesn't, I think, take place until 3Q. But all along you've been approaching this launch a little bit differently than in the past, even taking some downtime in 2017, for example, to prepare for a 2018 launch. So maybe could you just talk about some of the efforts that you've already taken and then are going to take in 1Q to kind of help to prepare for this smoother-than-typical launch in the back half of the year? I think it might be helpful because consensus is below your forecast currently. And I think a primary reason for that is that the Street is maybe not fully understanding why your profits can maintain at such a strong level while you're launching a new truck, because typically in the past both GM and Ford have seen, at least temporarily, lower profits in the year that they launch a new truck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Specific to this truck, again, start at a high level, Ryan, this is an all-new architecture. Our last three generations of truck were fundamentally off the same architecture, with changes in sheet metal. So, this is an absolute all-new architecture which requires all new body shops. So, when we take downtime at certain facilities, it's because we're either converting or constructing new body shops to facilitate this launch, and we've been opportunistic around doing that around holiday periods so that you can get extra time to make these transitions without a full impact on downtime. So, again, taking advantage of Christmas time and leading into Q1, we've taken that opportunity with this transition. As I said back in January, we expect the unmitigated impact of launch and volume for the next-generation truck in 2018 to be about 130,000 units. We've tried to leg that in over the 2017/2018 timeframe by taking, again, opportunistic downtime to do the work that we needed to do at the facilities. In addition, we will be launching this year, and we're in process right now, of building what we call the Oshawa Shuttle, where we're taking bodies from Fort Wayne through the old body shop, shipping those to Canada and painting and assembling trucks there, which will fill about half of that gap. So, that's a mitigating action to take, a pretty significant headwind of 130,000 units, in essence, mitigate half of it and we're confident that that's going to turn out to be a benefit for us in 2018. Again, this is a massive level of change in our four facilities with an all-new architecture, and we're going to have to manage this and execute this flawlessly over the next couple of years, and so far, so good. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking our questions here. Want to talk a little bit about solid results this year, with free cash flow coming down obviously from 2017 to 2018, you're going to have that to be flat year-over-year again. But as we head into 2019, is there any reason to think that we can't get back up to that pro forma $8 billion that you laid out for 2016? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I think 2019 might be a little bit premature for that, David. Again, this is early days, right? But going back to what I talked about earlier, what's going to drive kind of moving off the run rate that we're at right now into what we talked about before, it's going to be as we cycle through our heavy CapEx cycle, we're launching and starting to launch of the light duties in the T1 this year. And next year, we still have HDs and then the full-size SUVs. And we're launching GEM as well in 2019. So, I would say that we need to cycle through 2018, 2019 capital spending, and then we'll start to see a meaningful decrease in that beyond the 2019 timeframe. And I think that would be kind of the trigger point to see that inflection. I mean, again, very early days and all premised on kind of the environment we're operating in right now. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah. That's fair. I mean, just kind of picking through the results and thinking about some of the positives from an adjusted EBIT perspective, things like warranty expense, I mean, just trying to understand what's going to drop through that could maybe give you better free cash flow than kind of what you're guiding to for 2018 and then also picking up into 2019. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. And let's talk about warranty for just a second. Clearly, a good tailwind in 2017 from a P&L perspective. The drivers of that \u2013 half of that was kind of an absence of reserve adjustments that we took in 2016 and half of it was what we were seeing come through in base warranty, extended warranty experience which resulted in an adjustment to our reserves, but then on a go \u2013 the go-forward accrual. I think the cash impact of that bleeds in over time, because as you're adjusting reserves and the repairs, obviously, warranties extend for three to five years. So, that would be another area that we would expect to see an improvement in the cash associated with that, but probably beyond 2018. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just following up on a line of questioning earlier, I think, Mary, you were saying generating about a million miles per month with the test leads that you have. How much you augmenting that real world mileage with simulated miles? And does that grow over time and how much incremental expenses that really weigh on the P&L and CapEx for the autonomous development? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, just to be to be clear, we have about 100 vehicles, we'll be growing that fleet of the Gen 2, Gen 3, getting to a million miles a month. Not there yet, I just wanted to be clear on that. But we are absolutely supplementing and doing quite a bit of simulation both here and in San Francisco using the experiences that we have or the miles that we're capturing and the work that we've done in that space. So, I can't give you the specific number of simulated miles that we've done, but I will tell you it's very significant. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Is there any rule of thumb or ratio we should be thinking about? I know, I'd say one of your larger competitors, it's a very still number, but they were doing maybe 3 million miles overnight with some of their compute power. So, any color you can kind of give us there from a ratio of what you would think you need on simulated miles versus real world miles could be useful? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I don't have the specifics on that. We can look into that. I don't know if we've come out and said exactly how much we're doing from a simulation perspective. I would say I think when you look at the real performance that's happening, look at the rate of improvement, and there was just a study that came out where the substantial rate of improvement we had from disengagements and also the number of miles we traveled, I think it's pretty significant. So, I think all of that comes together with the real measures of what we're seeing in, again, in a very complex urban environment. We saw a 63% reduction in disengagements from 2016 to 2017. And also the average monthly miles per disengagement improved over 2,500%. So, very significant when you look at what we're doing with the miles we're experiencing and learning from in San Francisco added with the simulation. So I think it all comes together in those numbers, which I think is probably a better thing to look at. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hi, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a couple of questions remaining. One is just could you clarify what the Korea losses are running at right now within GMI? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: We don't report country-level profitability, Rod. So, sorry. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Maybe just switching gears to North America, obviously, pretty impressive pricing and ATPs. And I'm wondering if you can clarify \u2013 you've given us some of the components, but when you think about the net outlook for 2018, you said components were crossovers positive, obviously some weakness in the carryover, and it sounded like you're assuming higher subvention for a higher rate environment. The unusual thing this year is that you've got pretty tight inventories on the trucks, which I presume could help mitigate some of the normal incentives that you have on the run out. Any thoughts on how we should be thinking about your positioning for net price? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I think overall, net price will be positive in 2018 versus 2017. The benefit \u2013 the tailwinds will be crossover pricing, a full year of that, and really cycling off of pretty low transaction prices \u2013 pretty low, pretty tough pricing environment for us, given the age of those products into the new products. So that will be a tailwind. And the new truck will be a tailwind, I think, February 6. But those combined will be greater than carryover headwinds. And you bring up a good point. Clearly, we ended the year very lean from a truck inventory perspective and our production is going to be lower this year versus last year, so we expect to continue to run pretty lean inventories on a go-forward basis, and that will help mitigate some of the truck challenges as we kind of run through that. But net-net, overall positive with new being greater than carryover headwind. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And presumably you've incorporated some rate subvention associated with that 75 basis points you plotted. Is that correct? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, we've certainly built that into our baseline set of assumptions; a 75 basis point increase in rates as well as a continuation of kind of what we've seen over the last number of years as incentive spend as a percentage of transaction price. We've seen 60 bps to 100 bps on a year-over-year basis increase in that, so that's kind of the environment we're assuming is going to continue. A tough pricing environment in the U.S. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And just lastly, you've given in the past a really helpful analysis that basically helped us bridge to breakeven at like an 11 million SAAR. Just could you remind us what some of the cost elements are in your downside scenario? What are the levers that you can pull from a fixed cost perspective, maybe Tier 2 ad budgets, things like that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Sure. Again, this is \u2013 the proof is \u2013 this will be a very, very detailed assessment that we would have to go through, but if you look at our workforce today in the U.S. specifically, much more variable than it was in the past, we've got roughly 25% Tier 2 and a few percentage points of temporary, so call it 30% percent overall. Through 2019, we have no caps. We expected that to grow closer to 40% to 50%. So in theory, at a system level, if there was a 10% or a 15% reduction in volume, we should be able to take 10% to 15% of the labor-related costs out over a relatively short period of time. So that's one fundamental driver. Our manufacturing cost for modeling purposes would come out at the same pace as volume. Number two, we would obviously reduce marketing expense. Marketing expense over a baseline level is highly variable, right? And if you just tag that to a percent of next sales, if there's a 20% reduction in volume, you could reduce marketing expense by at least 20%. And clearly, another significant component would be our compensation structure which is largely variable. And if we're making less money, we're paying less variable compensation. Those three items in combination \u2013 and obviously, there'd be opportunities on the margin, not insignificant, but opportunities on the margin, those three will drive $3 billion to $4 billion roughly of fixed cost opportunity or cost opportunity in a typical downturn. And that's what's built into our U.S. breakeven or North American breakeven at a U.S. industry level of 10 million to 11 million units. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. That's real helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Couple of questions; one managerial and one more around housekeeping on accounting. The managerial ones is, with the cost reduction efforts both for material and employee-related, you haven't made a big deal of \u2013 unlike some other firms that are reducing costs of big, high-level programs that smell of consultants and program offices. But could you give us a sense of how the material cost saves and how the employee costs saves show up in terms of managerial actions that \u2013 are there ongoing targets? What are the key areas? How do you kind of balance getting the costs out without kind of going back to the old bean-counting reputation of GM? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah, sure. And this all started back in 2013, 2014, and I think we laid that out at the Deutsche Bank Conference the journey we've been on when we looked at the business and looked at the opportunities for the business and where it should be. And we did a lot of benchmarking. We did benchmarking around our material costs and the GM penalty we were carrying. We did benchmarking around harbor, manufacturing costs, benchmarking around world-class levels of SG&A, and we established benchmarks for all of the leads in those areas. And we have fundamentally been executing to those benchmark areas since 2014. Beyond that, we enabled the achievement of some of these benchmarks through a couple of important initiatives that we' ve launched : Operational Excellence and Global Business Solutions. Between the two of those, one was GBS. It has taken in a significant amount of work globally in the SG&A space that was very fragmented and not optimal and efficient, and brought it under one roof, common processes, common systems, end to end and drove significant savings in the more transactional side of the business. Operational Excellence is the way we do business now. When you look at a cost challenge or a business challenge and aftermarket challenge, we use operational excellence tool, Six Sigma, Lean, the whole toolbox to really at an enterprise level drive from where we are today to a target. And I think we do this in a very, very disciplined way. It gets a lot of visibility. The $6.5 billion by key driver, we review it with the management team and Mary on a regular basis. We review it with the Board of Directors. And I think that as opposed to consulting/bean-counting exercise, you're seeing it show up in the bottom line results as we continue to generate strong performance in an environment that is tougher than what we expected over the last couple of years. And we're going to continue to do that. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would just add to that. It's really driving the culture of everyone understanding that we need to continuously improve processes. And also, when we see challenges we've got to figure out ways to overcome them. So that's the mindset that Chuck is talking about. When there's a challenge or a target, we need to make sure we have a plan to address it, and every employee has the tools to \u2013 outside the structure tools like Six Sigma to go after those. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: So it's more of an ongoing culture than a one-time consulting exercise? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Absolutely. I mean \u2013 and the $6.5 billion that we set up a few years ago and talked about, purposefully, Mary and I talked about that externally to put the stake in the ground, so that we would hold ourselves accountable to it and be transparent around that commitment. And I would expect that, as I said earlier, once we cycle through that, there'll be a next round that we want to be held accountable to and people should build a track to the P&L \u2013 we wanted cost savings, because that would roll through to the P&L. And again, we're seeing that. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. A couple of accounting questions. One, any impact of the FASB accounting rule change around net periodic pension costs in terms of North America EBIT where you're generating pension income? And second around $9 billion write-down of deferred tax asset, you still have about $24 billion left. Can you give us a sense of when you, given your business plan, would likely flip to becoming a U.S. taxpayer, cash taxpayer? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Sure. On the first question, no impact on North American EBIT, it's just geography both above the EBIT line, so no impact. And I don't know where the $9 billion came from, but it was like $7 billion for the impact of tax reform going from the statutory rate of 35% to 21% on our deferred tax assets. We have about $23 billion left after that adjustment, and I would expect that we would remain a very low cash tax paying in a position for the foreseeable future, 2022-2023 timeframe. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So any impact of tax reform on cash taxes would be well after that. In the meantime, you're not a significant U.S. cash taxpayer? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. The way I would think about it is, absent that, beyond 2022-2023, we would start to move up into \u2013 closer to a 35% range or 28% range, and now we're not going to \u2013 it's a longer term benefit for us from a cash tax-paying standpoint. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Despite the GAAP adjustments? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I'd like to thank everybody for participating today. I hope you see that GM is a stronger, more focused company than we were just a few years ago, and we have much more work to do. In fact, just last week, we had our senior leadership team together to have \u2013 so everybody is perfectly aligned in what we need to accomplish in 2018 and beyond. We recognize that our industry is changing rapidly and with that, there are opportunities and there are also challenges. But as you look at the strategy that we've been executing, we believe that we will continue to capitalize on those opportunities, minimize the challenges and drive long-term shareholder value. That's what we come to work for every day. So, thank you all for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Thursday, April 26, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us, as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set materials published this morning, we have the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive VP and CFO. We will then open the line for questions from the analyst community. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. In the room today, we also have Tom Timko, VP, Global Business Solutions and Chief Accounting Officer; and Rick Westenberg, VP, Treasurer, to assist in answering your questions. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Dhivya, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. We generated results in line with our expectations in the first quarter, managing through the challenges related to restructuring in South Korea, planned downtime in North America, and elevated investments in future products, including our full-size pickups and GEM vehicles. So, if we look at the numbers, our net revenue was $36.1 billion. We had EBIT adjusted of $2.6 billion, EBIT adjusted margin of 7.2% and EPS diluted adjusted of $1.43. Our ROIC adjusted was 26% on a trailing four-quarter basis. And as expected, our adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $3.5 billion, higher than the typical seasonal pattern due to planned lower full-size truck production and incremental capital spending to support our new truck launches and GEM vehicles. The actions we are taking in 2018 include the transition to the new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup, key contributors to our $65 billion truck business, also our GM Korea restructuring, and this will set the stage for stronger performance as we move through the year and into 2019. In Korea, we have negotiated on a historic labor agreement, which was ratified early this morning by union members. Our employees and management have taken decisive action to set a foundation for viability in the future. Combined with reducing the manufacturing capacity, these actions will enable GM to be profitable at an enterprise level for vehicles produced in Korea. As part of this deal, the Korean Development Bank will be investing $750 million into GM Korea. The deal is subject to a binding agreement between the KBD and GM Korea, and we expect to finalize this in the coming days. Chuck will get into a bit more of the details in his remarks in a few minutes. But if you look at GM across the board, we are solidly profitable in all core operating segments, including GM Financial, where we achieved record EBIT adjusted of $443 million, and we are on track to achieve the full-year guidance we announced in January. Globally, we are growing and improving the returns in our core business by focusing on the right mix of products in the popular crossover, SUV and truck segments, by playing to win in every market where we compete and by working relentlessly to reduce costs. We are halfway through our most aggressive product portfolio renewal ever. As expected, our newest crossovers and SUVs are driving growth. Deliveries of GM's newest crossovers in the U.S. and China doubled year-over-year in the first quarter led by the GMC Terrain, the Chevrolet Traverse and Equinox and the Baojun 510 and 530. In the U.S., year-over-year total crossover sales rose 23% across all brands and Cadillac Escalade sales were up 8% despite new competition in the segment. So let's take a closer look at Cadillac, where we recently appointed a new leader, Steve Carlisle, to further accelerate the brand's progress. Our global Q1 sales grew 22.5% year-over-year led by continued growth in China. We have an opportunity to improve our performance in the U.S. luxury market with the Cadillac XT4 SUV that we will launch later this year. The Cadillac XT4 began the cadence of new models averaging one new vehicle every six months through 2021. And as Cadillac volume increases, we expect to see profit double over the next four years. GM China is outpacing last year's record performance with strong equity income and record sales in the quarter. Regarding U.S.-China trade, we have more than two decades of positive experience with our joint venture partners and we believe both countries value and understand the interdependence between the world's two largest automotive markets. Baojun, our fast-growing domestic brand in China, is on track to sell 1 million vehicles in 2018, just 10 years after it was created. Last month, it launched the 530 compact SUV and sales have already surpassed 10,000 units. China is very important to our global strategy for an all-electric future. Buick will add the Velite 6 plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and the Velite 6 EV to its China portfolio to capitalize on demand for new energy vehicles. In addition, we continue to invest in technology and innovation to enhance the customer experience, redefine the future of mobility and achieve our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We announced we will build the production version of the Cruise AV, leveraging our deep hardware and software integration. Having all AV capabilities under one roof gives us a competitive advantage in this space. We are making progress on achieving commercialization at scale in the dense urban environment in 2019, and safety has been and will continue to be paramount in our commercialization effort. We are also expanding the partnership using our embedded 4G LTE connectivity in our vehicle data platform to offer convenient commerce options to our customers and to generate new revenue. Using marketplace, owners of eligible 2017 model year vehicles across all of our brands can use their in-car touchscreen to pay and save when they fuel up at Shell stations, eliminating the need to swipe a credit card or use a mobile device. This week we introduced Amazon Key in-car delivery, a service enabled by OnStar that delivers Amazon Prime packages directly to more than 7 million GM vehicles in the U.S. at no extra cost. And finally, I'm extremely pleased to welcome Devin Wenig, the eBay President and CEO, to our board. His wealth of experience in technology, global operations and digital marketplaces, all with a focus on the customer, will be an important addition to our board. So now I'd like to turn it over to Chuck. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. We delivered solid on-plan performance in the first quarter with all core operating segments reporting profitable results. As expected, we faced some headwinds to start the year, driven by the traditionally weak Q1 seasonality, coupled with retooling downtime as we prepare to launch our all new full-size pickup trucks. In total, we generated $36.1 billion in revenue, $2.6 billion in EBIT adjusted, 7.2% margins and $1.43 in EPS diluted adjusted at the enterprise level in the first quarter. The Q1 cash burn of $3.5 billion reflects the impact of lower earnings, working capital timing and increased capital spending to support the new full-size pickup truck and GEM program launches. It's important to note that free cash flow results are in line with what we'd expected going into the quarter. North America generated solid results with $2.2 billion of EBIT adjusted and 8% margins. These are more typical results for Q1 versus the results posted in the first quarter of 2017 when we had a significant inventory build ahead of product launches. Q1 was down $1.2 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by planned downtime in our truck facilities and absence of dealer inventory build in the first quarter of 2017. Our U.S. transaction prices, which are net of incentives, continued to grow in the first quarter. Our first quarter ATPs of almost $35,000 were $600 higher than the first quarter of 2017. We expect continued strong pricing performance driven by our new crossovers and the launch of our new trucks later in the year. Importantly, we expect to sustain a full-year EBIT adjusted margin of 10%, primarily due to continued strength in the U.S. industry, benefits from a full year of new crossovers, the launch of our all new full-size trucks and continued focus on overall cost efficiency. Moving to GM International. As a reminder, GMI is now a combined reporting segment consisting of the former GMIO region and the former GM South America region. Overall, EBIT adjusted performance for this segment was flat year-over-year, with strength in China and improvement in South America as the market continues to strengthen, offset by weak volume in Korea driven by the current dynamics in that market. China continues to deliver strong results with record equity income of $600 million for the quarter. Pricing pressure remained a challenge, but was more than offset by the richer mix of crossovers, strong sales from Buick, continued growth from Baojun and Cadillac, and focused on cost efficiencies. In Korea, as Mary said, we have reached a conditional agreement with the labor union, Korean Government, and the Korean Development Bank. This is a landmark achievement. GM Korea expects to realize $400 million to $500 million in annual cost reductions through plant closure, labor and other efficiencies, which will lead to profitability in 2019. In addition, through these savings, efficiencies and strong new product programs, we expect to generate 10% to 20% return on invested capital in the medium-term. And, as part of the agreement, GM Korea will save a total of $750 million for future investment from the Korean Development Bank. A few comments on GM Financial and our Corp segment. As we continue to progress towards full captive, GM Financial posted record revenue of $3.4 billion and record earnings before tax adjusted of almost $450 million in the first quarter. Earning assets grew $13.2 billion to $88.1 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth. For the full year, we expect to see a meaningful improvement in GM Financial earnings versus 2017. In the Corporate segment, costs were $300 million for Q1, reflecting lighter spending from a quarterly cadence perspective, driven by timing and expenses. We continue to expect the Corp segment quarterly cost to be about $500 million for 2018, including $1.1 billion in transportation as a service spending for the year. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. As I mentioned earlier, our cash burn in Q1 was as expected $3.5 billion, down versus 2017 and down versus a typically weak Q1 run rate of about $1.5 billion. This was driven by factors specific to Q1, downtime for truck changeover, elevated capital spending and working capital timing. We are on track with our 2018 free cash flow expectation of approximately $5 billion, which we will generate through strong EBIT performance for the balance of the year, working capital rewind, our annual China dividend payment and reduced capital spending on a run rate basis. During the quarter, we returned $600 million to our shareholders through $500 million in dividends and $100 million in stock repurchases through our participation in the VEBA Trust sale. Our pace of buybacks for 2018 will be dependent on our free cash flow generation and any additional calls on cash throughout the year, such as the Korea restructuring payments. We would expect share buybacks to be weighted to the second half of the year. With regard to our total company outlook for the full year, as I mentioned, Q1 was in line with our expectations and we are on track to deliver on the guidance we outlined at the beginning of the year. We expect core EBIT-adjusted and core automotive-adjusted free cash flow to be generally in line with the core business performance in 2017. With regard to commodities, we anticipate a continued increase in raw material prices, which we expect to largely mitigate through cost performance, similar to what we did in the first quarter. We expect the incremental impact from tariffs will be minimal, given that most of our steel and aluminum is domestically sourced and we have long-term supply contracts in place. Reiterating the cadence of earnings for the rest of the year, we continue to expect Q2 and Q3 to be strong and Q4 to be weaker on a relative basis. The relative weakness in Q4 is driven by additional downtime in preparation for the new truck launch. As mentioned, we expect significant year-over-year profit growth at GM Financial and at least $2 billion of equity income in China, as well as a meaningful improvement in our South American markets in GMI. To sum it up, the first quarter performance came in as expected with all core operating segments reporting profitable results. The full-size truck launch is on plan and will support earnings growth later in the year and in 2019. And while the environment is more challenging than just a few months ago, the entire team is focused on meeting our commitments in 2018, just as we have done for the past four years. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, everybody. Just a first question, now that you're almost through the issues in Korea, just curious what is next on your list to address, because you seem to be ticking through these things after GM Europe, Korea, and there must be something else next on your list. Just curious if it's South America, or if we'll ever get to a point where the segments might include GM trucks, Cadillac, GM Financial and mobility, and we might not be thinking about things the same way as we're thinking about them right now as far as segments. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yeah. First, I would say we think we have an exceptionally strong franchise in South America. When you look at the market share leadership position, we have number one selling product with Onix and the fact that we took our break-even point in South America down 40%, we are now really well-positioned and we are seeing that opportunity as that market starts to grow. And then, when you look at the new product that we'll have coming with our GEM set of vehicles, it really positions us very strongly in South America. So, that's not somewhere we're going next. That's a franchise we think is a strength of General Motors and we'll see that demonstrate and contribute to the bottom line as we move forward. I would say, Korea, as we've talked about in the past, was a very important country. It's so important because of the supply base there and because of the very talented engineering resources that we have there. So this is historical agreement that we are very close to closing, but is on track and, with the labor agreement ratified, really positions it nicely there. I would say there's a couple other countries where we have work to do, not to exit, but to improve the profitability, and we are on that. And then, if you look at as we've looked across the segments of our vehicles, investing and seeing the success in crossovers, and very optimistic about our full-size truck family of vehicles. The launch is going well. The truck is building exceptionally well. The customer feedback we're getting is very strong And so we've really \u2013 if you I'm sure have looked at both the Silverado and the Sierra have really been customer focused as we made improvements to features functionality for those trucks. So we're very excited about that. So, strong investment in full-size trucks and crossovers, and then leveraging the investments we made in 2015 and 2016 from a U.S. perspective in cars allows us to not continue to invest, but to have strong offerings in the marketplace because although there are several car segments that are shrinking, they still are large and that's an opportunity. So I would say, with Korea, we've really done the major areas that we need to address and now it's just continuing to strengthen and improve the profitability with the right products and going there to win. As it relates to how we might segment report going forward, I think the segment reporting we have right now is appropriate and that's something that we always evaluate and look to see what's going to provide the right transparency to demonstrate the growth and the potential that we have going forward. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got you. That's helpful. And then, just a second question around potential for changes in ownership structure or JV requirements in China. I mean you've had some pretty strong performance over there, a strong partner with SAIC. Just curious how you think about this, if we really do get the change and you could operate sort of as a wholly-owned stand-alone company over there, would you make that change? Or do these JV partners really give you an advantage in the market that you might not have otherwise on your own? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: We think we have an outstanding partner in SAIC. We've been working together for more than 20 years. So we think having a partner that understands the environment, whether from a government perspective, regulatory perspective, overall policy, and then deep customer insights as well, is an advantage. And if you look what we've been able to accomplish in the leadership position that we have in China, I think that reinforces it. We've also been able to drive efficiencies by sharing development, especially if you look at electric vehicles that allows us to leverage that around the world. So we'll continue to look at what's in the best interest of our shareholders. But, right now, we strongly believe that the JV has provided tremendous benefit and will continue to. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, just lastly real quick on raws. You were sharing \u2013 or you were absorbing, I should say, a larger portion of the raw mat complex than you were prior to the downturn, as you sort of helped out a lot of suppliers. I'm just curious, as we see raws rise, is there an opportunity to potentially share that risk, or increase or decrease with the rest of the value chain a little bit more directly? I mean, it's understandable that you might want to hold on to sort of the key component of steel and aluminum or some of the metals, but the rest of the complex seems like it might be the purview or better served to be the purview of suppliers. Just curious if there's any thought there or changes that might be afoot in sharing that risk across the value chain? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. John, let me answer that question. A couple of dimension. First, we buy about $16 billion of raw material on an annual basis. Only one-third of that is indexed, which means we're exposed to fluctuations in commodities on about one-third of that or roughly $5 billion to $6 billion a year or so. You can do the math, the 5% movement in commodities will impact us $300 million to $400 million. Obviously, there's always a lag associated with that. The rest of the commodities are bought on long-term contract. Ultimately, they'll be subject to negotiation, but I'm just talking about near-term moves in commodities. So we feel like we're in reasonably good shape there. Second, as we engage with suppliers, we engage with suppliers across the entire value chain, looking at opportunities for efficiency, productivity, and cost sharing or cost savings opportunities. And we've been engaging with them on a strategic basis over the last number of years. So we will look at commodities. We will look at foreign exchange. We will look at footprint opportunities. We'll look at opportunities for technical savings and productivity. And we've been pretty successful over the last number of years of really driving some benefit to the bottom line as part of our $6.5 billion cost efficiency target, of which we've generated $5.7 billion through the first quarter. A big chunk of that is commercial and technical savings, which we have used to mitigate any of the headwinds that we've seen in commodities. And again, in the first quarter, if you look at commodity headwinds year-over-year, there were a couple hundred million dollars, and we offset it with commercial and technical savings, and I would say we're on track to do that for the year. So I don't know if that answers your question. I think you've got to look at it holistically across the entire value chain. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : You guys have been very proactive in recent years about exiting under-earning or loss-making geographies, and I think have been rightly given a lot of credit relative to some of your competitors in this respect. With that said, yesterday Ford announced that they would drop all but two passenger cars from the North American line-up. It looks like the Chevrolet brand offers nine passenger cars versus six trucks, crossovers, and utilities, maybe depending on how you count. Of course, you have more at Buick, et cetera, and you have several plants, including Lordstown now with just one shift, but also what I think Fairfax or Kansas City, I forget, or Orion Township (23:19) et cetera, that seem mostly or entirely focused on passenger car. So it would seem that maybe you tell me is there an even greater opportunity to improve margin by rationalizing passenger car line-up at GM, given your greater number of offerings, greater complexity. So, what are your thoughts on this opportunity and over what period of time could investors expect to see such changes? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think already when you look at \u2013 as I mentioned before, in 2015 and 2016, we launched new very efficient architectures in the mid-size and compact, and that is proving well as a good platform to go forward with fairly minor changes where we have new offerings coming that are very focused on features and styling that customers want in these segments. So I think we're going to see the benefit of that. And the segments, as I mentioned before, are still significant enough that we think there's an opportunity because we've made the investment, don't need to deploy little to no capital as we move forward. So we see it as an opportunity. We are always looking for how do we make sure we're customer focused and then drive that as efficiently as possible. We have worked on each of our car lines over the last year to make sure that we're driving efficiencies across all areas of the business that support those. So, yeah, I think what you're going to see us do is very efficiently play at a segment that, although is declining, there still is opportunity. And then, as you look around the globe, the GEM family of products that we are going to be starting to launch next year from China that still has a significant car market as well from not only Chevrolet, but also Buick, and then you look at South America that also has a very strong car portfolio, and the GEM family will support that. I think we're well-positioned in cars. We're always looking for efficiencies and will be responsive to the marketplace, as you saw with the shift change that we made at Lordstown. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: And if I could just add to that, Ryan, and to Mary's comments, a lot of the questions seem to be focused on the U.S. market, rightfully so. And as Mary mentioned, we think we're reasonably well-positioned with the investments that we made. But I think you should take a step back and look at, and you mentioned it upfront, some of the actions and the tough decisions we made over the last numbers of years which were largely in passenger car markets, Chevrolet Europe, Russia, the Opel-Vauxhall sale, India, South Africa, what we just did tackling Korea; and to South America specifically, largely a passenger car market, we've reduced the breaking point by 40%. All of those addressed inherent passenger car profitability issues. And then, as Mary mentioned, with the GM launch, we're replacing a number of legacy architectures with a profitable architecture that will go across both passenger cars and crossovers. So I think it's been very, very systematic over the last number of years. And frankly, I think you're seeing the results flow through the bottom line, as we've grown margins by over 300 basis points since 2015. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful. Thanks. And just lastly from me, GM International profits were better than I had expected. I know you don't break out South America separately any longer, but if you could maybe speak directionally to the performance of the different geographies that comprise GM International? I mean, we can see from the equity income, China is doing fantastic, but any sort of update on what you used to call consolidated international operations? We like to sort of track how you were reducing your losses there. And then, South America, I imagine you're continuing to do quite a bit better than your peers, but if you could speak directionally to your performance there and what you're expecting for the remainder of the year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. What I said earlier today, and again, this is one segment, but clearly China equity income was up in the consolidated piece of this. We had some challenges in Korea, and frankly, the domestic market pulled back significantly and probably not a surprise to anybody given the dynamics that we are engaged in with the plant closure and everything else and concerns about whether we are going to be there long-term. I would say we continue to make progress in South America. The industry continues to improve and I'd say, on a year-over-year basis, we're continuing to improve our performance overall in that segment. So kind of the puts and takes would be weaker kind of Korea, stronger South America, China equity income. That's the way I would think about it. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Morning. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hi. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: It's no secret because you put it in your 10-K that your trucks account have much higher profit margins than crossovers or cars. We've talked about cars. Crossover had been declining in terms of its percentage of the margin. Your crossovers were aging but they're re-launching. So, I guess, kind of two questions. As you go, what kind of improvement in the crossover profitability due to the Traverse, Equinox at all? Are we going to be seeing this year? And then, second, as we roll out towards 2020 with the moves of competitors to add more crossover capacity, more crossover model offerings, both we heard that from Ford and, of course, we knew the Fiat, Chrysler, Jeep plants, kind of how do you think about maintaining your profitability going into 2020 in crossovers, as you face that new competition with older platforms and then, of course, in big truck as one of the other three launches their new truck around that timeframe? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I think, a pretty broad-based question, Brian. First, when we think about 2018, we very specifically in the past, the 10% percent margins in North America, we said we were going to have about a $900 million headwind, roughly speaking, related to the truck launch and the reduced production. We said the gap fill on that there was going to be about $0.5 billion of improved profitability in crossovers. And we're very, very much on track with that. So, that's kind of we're seeing the full-year benefit. And clearly, our 2017 results and the profit erosion on crossovers was driven largely on the sell-down of the old crossover. So I would say that very, very much on track. Looking forward, clearly, continued improvement and crossover profitability is critical and front and center with us. So I think that's going to be driven by two dynamics. One is we'll continue to launch new crossovers in the segments we're not participating. Later this year, we'll launch the XT4, for instance, in Cadillac. And I think you're going to continue to see new entries which will drive our overall presence and aggregate profitability in crossovers. And we also are very, very focused at the enterprise level on operational excellence. And we were talking about passenger cars earlier, but what we do sponsored by a senior leader of the organization is on a weekly basis look at these car lines and look at very specific actions on how we can continue to drive performance improvement, largely from a cost standpoint. And we've got a lot of traction with that and we'll continue to do that with crossovers. So it's not lost on us that crossovers are going to be more competitive. What we're going to do is run real hard to stay out in front of that, both with new entries, and continuing to drive cost efficiency in the entries that we have. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just to follow-up from that, in terms of some of these restructuring activities in international as well as we're covering macro, when do we think about that we say normalized margins in places like South America or Asia-Pacific, ex-China, and kind of will that especially in a specific ex-China be off of a lower revenue base? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Back in the day when we reported South America separately, we said we were on a path to mid-single-digit EBIT margins there as we worked through the break-even and launched the GEM product, and I'd say largely on track. I think somehow the message isn't getting through. We just landed a deal in Korea that would generate $0.5 billion a year of savings. That's $0.5 billion which goes right to the bottom line and it'll start to accrue as we move through Q2 through the rest of the year. That's a big step towards improving the overall GMI segment on a go-forward basis. So, between those two things. I think there's a meaningful uplift in our GMI profitability ex-China, continuing in 2018 and then through 2019 and 2020. And we talked before that we wanted the whole GMI segment to be profitable in 2019, and that is still very much our objective and what we're driving to. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, everybody. Just two questions. The first is economic and policy related. I've been asking the CEOs across town the same question. Mary, would you support an increase in the U.S. federal gasoline tax if the proceeds went to rebuilding our U.S. infrastructure? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, Adam, I think in general it's a little more complicated than a yes-no answer. What I would say is, first of all, we are in full agreement that the infrastructure needs to be addressed and improved substantially and quickly. We need to do that in a way where we focus on the customer and make sure that we're looking at their affordability and their overall cost of ownership. And I think there's multiple solutions whether it's road use, whether it's gas tax. But then I think we also have to look at the changes that are going to occur over time from an EV perspective and look at how do we take multiple ways to fund the infrastructure that support where we're headed with the changes in transportation and mobility, making sure that we comprehend EV charging, for example, or we're at the right beta infrastructure type of a solution is in that. So we very much want to be part of the solution. We think that municipalities and the government at all levels need to come together. A gas tax can be a part of it, but I think we need to look at this much more holistically and over a much longer-term. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Appreciate that. Just a follow-up, Mary, last question on GM and Amazon. So I find the agreement with Amazon from yesterday or day before just fascinating. I mean, they have 100 million Prime subs. You have 100 million cars on the road, more or less. It's nice round numbers. Amazon is going to spend about $60 billion this year on shipping and fulfillment, and you can really help them solve a major pain point for them in their customers and logistics. So, two parts to this question, Mary. First, is this not just the tip of the iceberg on the ways that GM can work with Amazon on logistics and customer experience, content delivery. I mean, this can be a lot more than just Amazon putting their junk in GM's trunk, right, Mary? And then the second is just how does GM get paid for this, because you could be saving Amazon billions of dollars? Can you walk us through the revenue? Like, do you get paid per delivery, per car, per month? How does GM get paid because you're doing all the work? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, it's a \u2013 I'm not going to go into the details of the sizing, but I will just say it's on kind of a use based model of how we get paid. So, first of all, I agree. I don't know if I'd call it junk in the trunk because I think being customer focused is one thing (35:00) that they want. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Packages. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: But the security \u2013 the peace of mind that we give them of, one, something not being dropped at their door but being in a locked vehicle, the convenience of that, them knowing when it's going to get there, et cetera, I think this is a huge customer value and I think we are just, no pun intended, unlocking the value that we have from having the base of vehicles that are connected. So I agree with you, I think there's much more opportunity with Amazon and others. And I think we're working aggressively as we go forward to do that. We have a good relationship with Amazon and on this I think, as we move forward, we'll see that it benefits our customers. It definitely provides an opportunity for General Motors to generate revenue and profitability and it's a more efficient way for Amazon to get, as you call it, that last mile. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well, any other transparency on just that revenue because these initiatives are being announced, but the OEMs are doing a pretty poor job I think of just explaining how \u2013 like, at a micro level, you press on an app, Amazon gives you an option to put it in a GM vehicle, how does GM get compensated? So, just some feedback as when it's appropriate that that would make a big difference. Thanks, everybody. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. Hey, Adam, just one point on that. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, as I said, it is a kind of a per-transaction type of opportunity with Amazon. So I think we'll see and discuss that more as we go forward. But if you look at Marketplace, which is also \u2013 we're getting the ability to get paid not only just on impressions of the opportunity that another company's product is positioned very appropriately and safely in the vehicle at the right time and on demand. So it's impressions as well as transactions. So, as this grows, I think it's going to be meaningful. And we will share more. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, Mary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hey, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a couple of questions. One, could you talk a little bit about the management changes that Cadillac? And just from everyone's comments it sounds like you wanted to see things done faster or differently. How exactly is that going to be executed? And can you just remind us of what your targets are there? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, Rod, appreciate the question. And this is not a right turn from a Cadillac strategy perspective. We have we think a very strong product cadence, starting with the XT4, having a new vehicle, a new product coming out on average every six months. We see a huge opportunity to grow our volume, grow our profitability. I believe longer-term there is a huge opportunity for Cadillac to really redefine luxury when you look at how aggressively we're pursuing electric vehicles as well as autonomous. And so this was really an acceleration and looking to make sure that as we are setting the strategy for the future and really have a huge opportunity both in the U.S., China and then in many other markets, that we're also executing today in the key markets that we participate in. So this is not a right or left turn. We will still stay in New York with this team and it's a move to accelerate. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: And relative to the objectives, Rod, that we talked about before and this kind of goes back to the foundation in 2016, we wanted to double Cadillac sales by kind of the 2020-ish timeframe, so think about something north of 0.5 million units globally that would include China, and to improve our profitability by roughly $1 billion. And that would largely be on consolidated operations and largely driven by the U.S. And that's the path that we're executing to, as Mary mentioned. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And you're on that path currently, that improvement of $1 billion? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, we're certainly building the foundation and filling up the product portfolio to get us there. Obviously, we're going to work very hard to accelerate that. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Just switching gears. In the North American auto business, can you frame how we should be thinking about structural and contribution costs now as you pick up the pace of product launches and particularly these trucks? Presumably, the upside from mix and price should be very positive, but just help us think about the other side of it. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: What's your timeframe, the balance of the year? Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. As we look out this year and then into next, to the extent you can give us a sense of this, should we be thinking structural costs are flat or do they go up? And how should we be thinking about, with all the content coming in, the contribution cost side of things? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would say the following and let's kind of launch off 8% and keep this at a reasonably macro level. Now we generated 8% in the first quarter. We expect full-year margins at 10%. What's going to drive that is improvements and mix, as you talked about, with the increased production of full-size trucks and utilities versus the first quarter. I think, interestingly and perhaps not as transparent, we will also significantly improve our mix of crew cabs. Crew cab mix was kind of 58% of total pickup in the first quarter. We had downtime in crew cabs. Rest of the year, that's going to be closer to 74% of truck production and that's a significant driver of profitability in trucks. We expect material cost performance to largely offset commodity. So, that cost factor is going to be relatively flat. And we would expect to see an improvement on a run rate basis rest of the year in fixed costs, largely as we cycle through manufacturing launch costs and continue to drive efficiency in the organization. That's kind of the broad strokes for 2018. As I think about kind of the future, there is going to be two increases I would say in fixed costs as we think about it. One will be D&A, and we've been talking about that for a long time as, obviously, the investment in the new truck is going to carry with it increased D&A. I'd also expect some increased marketing expense as we cycle through this year and to next year to support this launch. This is the franchise, so we expect that expense to go up. And we will endeavor to drive efficiency, but broadly speaking, would expect to see some increase in fixed cost on a go-forward basis, largely related to launch timing, marketing associated with these. And we talked before, as we cycle through the truck and these crossover launches, we expected to see engineering expense come down. That's kind of beyond 2019. So I'm not sure I'm answering the question, Rod, clearly. But I would say material cost is going to be relatively flat with performance offsetting commodities. Price on majors will offset or more than offset material on majors. We'll then get some mix improvement. And I think fixed costs are going to inch up a little bit at least in the near- to medium-term. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. That's perfect. And just lastly, any quick color on progress on AV development? What are the milestones that we should be looking for? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, we are still on track for launching in a ride-sharing environment in 2019, so hitting the milestones. I think the filing that we did with NISSA (42:53) was important to do in that process. And so, of all the key areas, we're on track knowing where we're going to build the vehicles, et cetera. So I don't have any specific milestones other than that we proceed to the ramp that we shared when we talked about this last year, and we'll be gated by safety. But I think when you look at all aspects of safety and the fact that we have it under one roof, that we have deep integration, and when we've talked about it in the past that we changed or modified 40% of the subsystems in the vehicle for AV, that shows the extent of the work we're doing deep in the vehicle to make sure we have the right redundancy and safety overall. In the AV, I'll say brain of the vehicle itself, we also have gone through great lengths to make sure we have the right redundancies. So, safety will gate us, but we're on track. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hi. Great. Thank you. Building off of that comment, Mary, can you maybe let us know what the update is for your testing and mapping and potential employee-only service in New York. And then, from there, there was a Waymo announcement during the quarter, now are going to have Chrysler Pacifica cars as well as the electric I-PACE a little bit more of an upscale vehicle. How do you think about that potential competition level and then your offerings of your AV ride-share relative just to the electric bulk that you have? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, first, from your perspective, we have done significant mapping of that area and we're going to be working with the, I'll say, city and state from a regulatory perspective to enable us to do that. We have a lot of focus on San Francisco, but that work is going on in parallel. It's a different environment both from the actual environment of the streets, the roads, et cetera, and how people drive, but also from a regulatory perspective that we're working that in parallel. And then, I can't comment about Waymo strategy. I would say I don't have anything further to announce in what vehicle that we'll be doing beyond the both Bolt EV. But I think when you look at the Bolt EV, it's really perfect for ride-sharing in its functionality, sizing, it's quite spacious for a B-size segment. So I think we have the right product and I would also again say we are the only person that is working aggressively in the AV market that has everything under one roof and is doing the deep integration and redundancy to make sure we can deliver safely. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. And then one question for you, Chuck. On the free cash flow and kind of your net cash balance, can you give us a little bit of color on when you think the timing of the working capital recovery and the China dividend is going to hit 2Q, 3Q of this year? It sounds like 4Q might be a little bit more messy from a working capital perspective with some incremental downtime. And then, as I think about net cash, a year or two ago, GM was sitting around $10 billion, $11 billion. Today, it's around $2 billion. Where do you think the right amount of net cash level is for the business? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Speaking on the cadence, clearly we're going to rewind. Let me start at a little bit higher level first. When you think about cash generation, balance of the year, it's going to be driven by three or four major factors. One is we're going to generate a significant amount of EBIT based cash. So, think about EBITDA in the range of $12 billion plus. Number two, we'll get the China dividend. So, that's going to be a tailwind versus kind of the cash in the first quarter. Third, I talked about the CapEx run rate. We're going to be spending at a lower run rate on a go-forward basis versus the first quarter run rate and then the working capital rewind. And when you look at those big drivers, it's pretty easy to kind of get yourself to a path of the $5 billion that we talked about. Clearly, the second quarter is going to be important from a free cash flow generation perspective and I would expect to see a pretty significant step up there. Q3, typically with the downtime, we have a tendency not to be as strong and I would expect Q4 to be strong just from a cadence perspective, from a cash flow perspective. Within our capital allocation framework, we have talked about liquidity of $30 billion to $35 billion and debt. And when I talk about debt as external debt plus underfunded pensions of $25 billion to $30, we've been purposefully working that down over time on the debt side of it and ended last year just over $26 billion. Obviously, we'd like to continue to get some run rate on pensions on a go-forward basis and continue to drive that down. So I would say that, setting aside the pension piece of it, somewhere in the zip code of $5 billion or so of net cash feels about right, $18 billion target cash, and somewhere in the $13 billion to $14 billion debt. That's something that we could handle and absorb within our capital allocation framework and our balance sheet directionally. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of the Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Morning. Just have one financial and one strategic question. On the financial, Chuck, can you just clarify the Korea savings, how much hits in 2018 versus 2019? And then, more broadly around 2019, how are you feeling around the prior outlook for further earnings acceleration in 2019, just given some of the macro developments in the first quarter? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. I would say that, from a Korea perspective, we'll start to get the benefit of a significant portion of that in the second half of the year, primarily related to the Gunsan plant closure and some of the other head count reductions. And I don't want to get into a lot of specifics on the labor agreement, but some of those opportunities from a labor agreement perspective will start to accrue in the second half, but the run rate will be through 2019. Again, when I think about the $0.5 billion, about half of it is related to the Gunsan closure and the other half is related to some of the agreements that we got with the union. So we're going to see it in the second half of the year and then the full-year impact next year. Relative to 2019, I mean I step back and look at this, and at least from my perspective nothing has changed versus our view that 2019 is going to be stronger than 2018. We will be through a significant portion of the full-size truck launch, at least the light duties, and they'll be up and running, which is going to be a significant benefit for us. We will have another year of adjacency growth, primarily through GM Financial, but also customer care and after-sales in OnStar. We're really encouraged by China and the start that we've had in China this year. And if that market continues to perform, I think that's a potential tailwind. Again, I circle back to the Korea deal, that's a $0.5 billion improvement that really wasn't factored into our thinking back when we were talking about 2019. So I think that's another significant opportunity. And we expect to see further opportunities within GMI, going back to the discussion we had about recovery in Brazil, as an example. So we're still I mean early days, it's April, and who knows, the environment is a little bit more unsettled now than it was four months ago. But I don't think there's anything that's changed our view. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful, Chuck. And then maybe for Mary on the strategic side, going back to autonomous and as you get ready for the 2019 expected launch of the Cruise AV network. Any updated thinking around building your own network alone relative to partnership? And maybe one thing to bring up, of course, is what's been going on with Uber and then the unfortunate predicament there, whether that potentially changes the thinking for GM to perhaps pursue partnerships or even a co-chair agreement with them or other partners, as you kind of think about going to market next year? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yes. I don't have anything specific to announce here. As we said, we are positioned to go on our own, to partner with one or partner with more, and so we are still open to those opportunities. But we are also very much working and on track to be able to launch on our own with the Cruise app that we have. So, that still is opportunity as we move forward between now and then. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Hi, Emmanuel. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Just one follow-up on China. So there was a nice positive surprise in the quarter with earnings up and then margins seem to be, they're not quite flat but stabilizing. So is that something that you view as potentially sustainable? What sort of drove that in the quarter and how do we think about it going forward? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I think if you listened closely to my comments, I said, at least $2 billion. So, that would be a signal that we feel like there's some upside on what we had guided to before. I think what drove Q1, a couple of factors, and we've got to be very watchful and mindful of this. One, pricing moderated in Q1. The price headwind moderated in Q1 and it was roughly 4% to 4.5%, as opposed to the 5% to 6% headwind we've been facing, and we got to see how that continues to play out. Two, the luxury market was very good for us in the first quarter in China and there are some launches as we go through the rest of the year that could dilute some of that run rate that we've got in the first quarter. With that said, I was in China a month or so ago. Mary and Dan have obviously communicated our expectations that we continue to get momentum in the first quarter, and it feels pretty good. The market's developing kind of as expected, pricing a little bit more moderate, we've got a very, very strong launch cadence. Cadillac continues to perform well. The new Baojun products are performing well. So I'd say we're a little bit more bullish and, obviously, we continue to stay very, very focused on cost efficiencies like we have the last three years or four years, which is helping to stabilize that margin dynamic that you talked about, Emmanuel. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then, a follow-up on the autonomous roll-outs. I guess when you kindly invited us in San Francisco last year in November, the display was impressive but the cars weren't quite fully ready in some cases. I'm just curious, from a technology point of view, have you seen sort of an exponential improvement in sort of like the ability of the cars to deal with different situations and what sort of like gives you confidence in terms of the 2019 timeline? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: That opportunity kind of was I would say historic in itself because I think it's the first time this company has ever let somebody in a vehicle that early, which I think was very important, so understanding that those were really development vehicles that you had the opportunity or some had the opportunity to experience. We have a very well- defined development path. There is improvements and changes that are happening almost on a daily basis, as we continue to develop the software. So there's a well-defined track of what we need to accomplish to be able to launch in 2019 and we are on that path. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Mary, I know you've talked about your global electrification strategy, and I think it's 20 vehicles by 2023. I was wondering if you could put a little bit of a finer point on how that's going to look within China and maybe, like, what percent of sales by that timeframe you expect to be electric. And also just to remind us in terms of how that technology transfer works with the partners or do you license it to the JV? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Let me start with the last question. There are some things that are licensed and that have been developed by General Motors. There's some parts of the vehicles that we will co-develop. There are certain technologies that we consider very important from a General Motors IP perspective and we take special care to how we manage those. So it's really a combination as we look. And in some cases, working more closely with Chinese suppliers; in some cases, others. So it's not a simple one answer there, but I think it's a very well thought through of where the IP ownership is and then where the synergy is to be able to efficiently develop the electric vehicles. We have said that we'll have at least 20 vehicles by 2023. Two actually will be launching next year. We see and we have stated that a significant part of the volume will be in China because of the regulatory environment that is driving that, but we see opportunity to grow. I'm not going to put out specific numbers because I think, especially in some of the other markets, it will be very dependent on where our fuel price is and what's the regulatory environment. But we remain on track, that development is going very well and so we believe that we're going to be able to deliver affordable, desirable and range-appropriate vehicles into the marketplace. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then, Chuck, just maybe really just a clarification. I thought you said, on the Corporate side, to still expect a $500 million a quarter run rate over the rest of the year, which would bring you I think slightly below the $2 billion that I think was the prior indication. So, was that a change or actually is there a step-up over the rest of the year to still get to that $2 billion number? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: I would say, for modeling purposes, if you just put $2 billion in your model for Corporate spending, I think you'll be reasonably close for the year. I was trying to imply that, on average, we expected to spend $500 million a quarter, of which $1.1 billion would be transportation as a service. So there's certainly some expectations of some re-timing of some of the benefit that we saw in Q1, and a lot of that was corporate staff, legal, timing, some security and derivative kind of mark-to-market. We will certainly work towards getting that to be sticky, some of those savings and re-timings, as we go through the year. But I think, again, for modeling purposes, $2 billion feels like about the right number for the year. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned in the presentation that commodities have increased. I think in the past you said it's $500 million. What is sort of the impact that you're seeing now, just any color there? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. As I look back, and obviously this is a moving issue. So we started the year back in January and maybe even updated it when we did the annual earnings, we thought commodity headwinds on a year-over-year basis would be about $0.5 billion, roughly speaking. I would say, if I was putting a number on it right now, that would be somewhere closer to $800 million, maybe a little bit north of that, so somewhere in the $300 million or $400 million headwind versus what we thought. And obviously, not insignificant but we have expectations and continue to work to mitigate that. And I think if you look at the last three or four years, we've got a track record of being able to offset some of these headwinds that developed during the year, whether it was exchange, or commodity, and we're reasonably confident we'll be able to do that as well. Hence, no change in our overall guidance for the year. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And the GEM platform, when is that expected to launch and any color on when we actually start seeing the savings? Is that more of a 2019 help or that actually hit the second half? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Launching in 2019, I think the latter part. And so... Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Starts in 2019. And this is a big platform, 2 million vehicles, and there'll be a rolling launch of a number of different entries off this architecture, both in China and South America. But I would say the latter part of 2019, and you'll see the full kind of benefit of that by the latter part of 2020, early 2021. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just lastly, I think you've said in the past 70,000 units is the expected sort of decline in pickup production, is that still on track? Is that still the number we should be thinking? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yeah. Largely, when we were looking at the downtime related to the current generation truck, the K2, just the downtime was 120,000 to 130,000 units, and the (1:00:51) was going to fill about half of that gap. That's going to obviously play out. We launched it in the first quarter and play out as we go through the rest of the year. I think that's generally on line or consistent with what we talked about before. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. And everybody, thanks for participating today. I hope you see that our results continue to demonstrate this team's focused and disciplined approach to how we run the business, while we're positioning ourselves for the future. I'm very proud of the team around the globe for what they've been able to achieve and also I'm proud of our track record of meeting our commitments always with integrity. So we're going to continue to execute our plan. And if you look at our plan, we have built strong franchises and continue to strengthen them or build them in the core and adjacencies and in the transformative areas. We've talked a lot about what we've been able to achieve with crossovers and what we're going to continue to do there, and we're seeing the results in this first quarter. We are well underway for our full-size truck family of products that we're very enthused about. They're building well and so that will start to roll in the second part of this year and then very importantly through 2019 and 2020. We have worked hard and made the tough decisions that we have a strong franchise in South America and have very significant improvements in GMI, as well as exiting some of the businesses where we didn't see a path to generate the right return. We believe we're well positioned in China in opportunities for growth and, again, seeing that built in a strong first quarter. GMF is on plan as well as the opportunities we have in adjacencies like CCA. In OnStar, we are seeing growth in the number of customers utilizing OnStar services and we have much more to do to deliver services to our customers that will generate revenue and profitability as we leverage the connectivity and then the ability to monetize data, both in the vehicle and comparing it with other companies. And that's on the way to, as we look at the transformative area, of really creating an all-EV future with profitable, desirable, attainable and appropriate-ranged electric vehicles and the autonomous vehicle business that is largely accretive. So, when we look at where we're at as a company, I'm very pleased with what we've done, where we're going. I think there's significant opportunities to strengthen the business and grow it and, while doing that, deliver value to our shareholders. So, thank you very much for participating and we'll say good bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, July 25, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike, Director of Investor Relations. Michael Heifler - General Motors Co.: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2018. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Included in the chart set published this morning, we have the key takeaways from each chart in the notes pages in order to provide color on the results. This morning, Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO, will provide some brief opening remarks; followed by Chuck Stevens, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. We will then open the line for questions from the analyst community. In the room today to assist in answering your questions, we also have Dhivya Suryadevara, Vice President of Corporate Finance and incoming Executive Vice President and CFO; and Tom Timko, Vice President Global Business Services and Chief Accounting Officer. Before we begin I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Before I start and comment on earnings, I would like to share that at General Motors, our thoughts are with Sergio Marchionne's family and friends as well as the entire FCA team over his sudden loss. I think we all agree, Sergio will be remembered for the many, many accomplishments he had in our industry. And now, I'd like to move to the numbers. First, from a net revenue perspective, we generated $36.8 billion. We had EBIT-adjusted of $3.2 billion, EBIT-adjusted margins of 8.7% and EPS-diluted-adjusted of $1.81. Our ROIC-adjusted was 24.7%. And our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $2.6 billion. Our financial results in the second quarter, whilst solid, did not meet our plan. We faced significant external challenges including higher than expected commodity prices and currency devaluation in South America. We have been taking actions to mitigate these headwinds and that will continue. However, we expect this volatility to extend into the second half, and Chuck and I will share more on this in a few minutes. Before we do that though, I do want to point out the key accomplishments in the quarter that demonstrate we are executing the business with strength and discipline. We improved U.S. sales and market share through strong sales of crossovers, trucks and SUVs. In addition, China equity income was a Q2 record driven by record Cadillac and Baojun deliveries and strong market share. And GM financial growth and earning assets and continued loyalty performance contributed to a record earnings before tax-adjusted in the quarter. Production of our all new 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickups have begun on schedule, and we expect to begin delivering high contented crew cab models to customers in August. To support our commitment to quality, these trucks have been subjected to the most stringent testing and validation in our history, and we've accumulated over 7 million miles in that testing and validation. In addition, we secured landmark deals and alliances that will help us redefine the future of personal mobility. Let's take a deeper look at the core business performance by turning to the United States where sales are up 4% through June and where our brands gained market share in the quarter. Year-to-date, Chevrolet has posted record Trax, Equinox and Traverse deliveries. With a double-digit pickup sales increase in the first half of the year, Chevrolet and GMC outpaced the industry. Cadillac is on track to launch the XT4 luxury SUV this fall. And as I mentioned, our full-sized pickup launch is going very well, with our truck plants operating two shifts at over 100% capacity to meet the demand for current generation trucks while we're transitioning to our all-new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. In the second half of the year, GM China will introduce 10 new models including the Cadillac XT4. The focus is on high-demand segments including SUVs and MPVs and luxury vehicles. We expect increased launch-related costs in the second half of the year and because of competitive launches, we expect pricing pressures to intensify. But we remain confident in our 20 years of market strength in China. Due to established local and U.S. brands and our strong Chinese partner, our current outlook does not assume any comprehensive impact in China beyond existing trade flows. We also continue to be committed to our vision of zero crashes, zero emissions, and zero congestion, and we signed a landmark deal with SoftBank valuing GM Cruise at $11.5 billion. The GM and SoftBank investments are expected to provide the capital necessary to reach commercialization at scale. And we took an important step toward our all-electric future by partnering with Honda on next-generation battery development for our respective EV models. As part of this deal, Honda will source battery cells and modules from GM, and this creates scale and manufacturing efficiencies. We began this year expecting pressure from raw material prices and foreign exchange rates and while we have mitigated some of this effect the challenge has become significantly greater than we originally expected, and we believe it will continue in the second half of the year. Because of this, we have updated our full year outlook for EPS in the $6.00 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow to approximately $4 billion. Chuck will go deeper into the numbers and share our expectations for the rest of 2018. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. As Mary mentioned, while execution continues to be strong, we did experience a challenging second quarter, and we are facing greater than expected headwinds in commodity pricing and significant currency devaluations in South America. Again, in total we generated $36.8 billion in revenue, $3.2 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.7% margins and $1.81 in EPS-diluted-adjusted in the second quarter. We also generated $2.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow, in line with our expectations. North America generated $2.7 billion of EBIT-adjusted and 9.4% margins. These results are below our expectations. Q2 is down $800 million year-over-year primarily due to unfavorable pricing and trim mix from the sell-down of our current generation full-sized pickups, increased commodity pricing and timing of fleet sales. Our U.S. transaction prices which are net of incentives continue to grow in the second quarter. Our second quarter ATPs of almost $35,500 were $300 higher than the second quarter of 2017. We expect pricing performance to improve as we progress with the launch of our new trucks later in the year. And as we look into the second half, we remain focused and being disciplined from an incentive spending perspective. Regarding GM North America full-year EBIT-adjusted margins, we are on path to achieve our target of 10% margins. However, with the largely commodity-driven headwinds we are facing, a 9% to 10% range is more appropriate at this time. Moving to GM International, EBIT-adjusted performance in GM International is down $200 million year-over-year, driven by a significant devaluation of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real, partially offset by strength in China. China continued to deliver record results with equity income of $600 million for the quarter, up $100 million year-over-year. Pricing pressure remains a challenge, but was more than offset by the richer mix of vehicles, continued strong sales performance from Baojun, Cadillac, and Chevrolet and continued focus on cost efficiencies. Just a few comments on GM Financial, GM Cruise and our Corp segment. As we continue to progress towards full captive, GM Financial posted record revenue of $3.5 billion and record earnings before tax-adjusted of over $500 million in the second quarter. Earning assets grew $9.9 billion to just over $90 billion, supporting expected future earnings growth. And for the full year, we continue to expect a meaningful improvement in GM Financial earnings versus 2017. GM Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million as we continue progressing toward commercialization. We expect to spend approximately $1 billion in GM Cruise for the full-year. The Corp segment reflects an improvement of $300 million year-over-year in the second quarter, primarily due to the revaluation of our investment in Lyft. We still expect the Corp segment cost to be approximately $1 billion for the full year. Turning cash flow and capital allocation. In Q2, as I said, we generated $2.6 billion of adjusted automotive free cash flow, in line with our expectations, and down $200 million year-over-year primarily due to the lower EBIT-adjusted performance partially offset by favorable managed working capital. During the quarter, we returned $500 million to our shareholders through dividends. With regard to our total company outlook for the full year, the pressure from commodity prices and foreign exchange rates has been more significant than our original expectations. While we've been able to offset some of the headwind, the challenges have been greater than anticipated, and we expect approximately a $1 billion net headwind versus our original guidance. As a result, the incremental impact from these headwinds is reflected in our updated EPS outlook in the range of $6.00 and adjusted automotive free cash flow outlook of approximately $4 billion which excludes GM Cruise. As mentioned, we expect significant year-over-year profit growth at GM Financial. In China, we expect elevated pricing pressure in the second half due to competitive entries in the market and an increase in launch costs across multiple brands. Regarding earnings cadence, Q4 will be stronger than Q3 on a relative basis, as we increase full-sized pickup truck production. So, to sum up the quarter, while we are experiencing significant headwinds primarily as a result of recent developments in commodity pricing and FX rates, we're making every effort to mitigate the impact. Our execution remains strong. And when you look at our absolute level of performance, you'll see that it remains very solid. The full-sized truck launch is on plan. Regular production began earlier this month, and our first customer deliveries will begin next month with a rich mix of high content crew cabs. We continue to see a medium term path to profitability in GMI driven by our recent restructuring actions, the launch of our new GEM program in South America, and improvement in macroeconomic conditions in South America. Additionally, we expect profit growth in our adjacencies including GM Financial, aftersales and OnStar, and we continue to make considerable progress in the future of mobility as evidenced by SoftBank's recent investment in GM Cruise. We're excited about these opportunities ahead of us and continue to expect strong execution both over the short and long term. That concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. Thank you. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning, John. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a first question on the raw material pressures. Obviously, you can take actions internally and execute better and better, which you're doing. But there's also the potential to pass this through in price increases to the customer or potentially push down to your suppliers to help out a bit more. I'm just curious in those two directions, has there been any action or thought put into place in doing those and how successful could those be? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, let me just kind of size up the challenge on that relative to the commodity challenge. I mean at the end of the day, I noted that we had a net unmitigated exposure or headwind for the year of about $1 billion. The unmitigated headwind when you look at both commodities and FX is something north of $2 billion, so we've already executed actions to offset more than $1 billion of those headwinds and a big portion of that is commodities. We're doing that through commercial \u2013 incremental commercial and technical savings which gets to the supplier, a portion of that. We're also doing that, where possible, through pricing. And if you look at our pricing for the year and the second half, we expect pricing to be favorable by roughly $800 million on just pure MSRP. So, to the extent that we can, we're recovering that through pricing. Obviously, John, the market in the United States is challenging. This is a market driven kind of \u2013 we're going to be competitive in the market, again, to the extent that we have opportunistic ability to pass along some, we will. But I'd say the big picture is we've already are in or have executed or will execute actions that's going to mitigate more than 50% of the headwind that we're seeing. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, would it be fair to characterize $2 billion gross headwinds down to about $1 billion based on current actions that you've taken with the potential to maybe try to offset some more through other actions? Is that a fair characterization? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, I would say that remaining \u2013 when we look at the year, obviously, if we thought there were actions to mitigate the further $1 billion, we wouldn't have adjusted our guidance. I think on a go-forward basis, as we cycle through 2018, we have levers that we can pull that are longer term in nature. Obviously, we'll continue to work with suppliers, work with them across the entire value chain. We can look at footprint from a sourcing perspective. We can look at ultimately replacement or substitution of materials. So, we will not leave this unmitigated piece of this as a permanent erosion in margins, if that's kind of where you're getting at. And again, that's the commodity piece. For FX, I would say that you know that is largely the South American piece of the unmitigated exposure between the Argentinian peso and Brazilian real and I would say there's a lag effect. The FX is rolling through as we're cycling through this year. We're taking pricing action aggressively in Argentina and to the extent possible in Brazil. And we would expect as we exit this year, those to be relatively balanced. There's just a lag on how quickly you price for these things and the market acceptance. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's very helpful. Then next on sort of mix in price in the pickup segment, it sounds like there were some incremental pressure, but is this really the sell-down of the old truck or is there something else going on sort of in the competitive landscape in pickup? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. That's a good question, John. And again, starting at 10,000 feet when you look at North American results $2.7 billion and 9.4%. Both Mary and I stated that this was below our expectations. The biggest driver of the underperformance in the quarter was commodities. When you look at the price bridge year-over-year, I would say what we're seeing from a pricing perspective and what we're seeing in a mix perspective largely expected when you think about we're selling down the K2 and getting ready to launch the new truck. And the trim dynamic that we talked about from a mix standpoint in the second quarter is because our crew cab truck plant was down, getting ready to transition to the new crew cab. So, we were producing and selling largely regular cab and double cabs, which are clearly not as profitable as our high contented crew cab. So, that's more of a timing issue that will cycle through as go through the rest of this year and into next year. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly on Cruise, as we think about sort of progression of that business from an operating basis and a funding basis, are we still on target for commercialization next year? Could there be the potential for a on-demand service, branded Cruise, before you get to truly autonomous level 4 vehicles? And as we think about sort of the monetization and funding of this with SoftBank, really just sort of the first tranche of what investors should expect to see and could there be more down the line in other rounds of funding? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, John, we continue to progress and achieve the development that we're looking for. As we've said all along, we'll be gated by safety. But we are on track, and I think, very important investment with Softbank with the validation they did of \u2013 the approach that we're taking of having the deep integration. But beyond that, I don't have anything further to share. We're going to continue to look at what's in the best interest of growing this business, of creating first the safe technology (00:18:27) because that's what enables everything and then driving the network and then beyond. We do have the Cruise, I think it's called Cruise Anywhere where we're already leveraging our own network in driving Cruise employees. But I think we're focused as we've said and on a path for a deployment in a ride-sharing environment in 2019. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow on the thinking about the second half versus first half in GMNA, the improvement. The commodity cost remains, so the offset to get to that 9% to 10% considering where you are in the first half is really more some of that mix and some of those new programs \u2013 some of the new trucks coming on? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: That would be correct. If you look at truck production in the first half of the year, we were down versus the first half of last year roughly 40,000 units. That's going to \u2013 we're going to be transitioning out of that. My big picture would be truck production is going to be kind of flat in the second half of 2018 versus the second half. So, we'll cycle past that. And you've got the benefit of the new trucks and what that's going to do from both a mix and a pricing perspective. So, I think as I think about the big picture in the second half, you've got favorable mix, favorable price of the new trucks which is more than going to offset kind of cost associated with launch primarily engineering and D&A and some of the commodity headwinds. Again, when you add it all up for the year, you end up in the zip code in 9% to 10% margins, and that will largely be the commodity headwinds that we are unable to offset. But fundamentally, the big drivers remain as they were back in January relative to second half versus first half. The new issue is the commodity escalation. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Just taking a step back from the quarter, there was obviously news coming out about some of the fuel economy standards sort of being pushed out and maybe even sort of withdrawing California's ability to regulate. Like I believe in the past you talked about how that was actually a positive because it made standards a little bit more homogenized across the region. So, is that still the thinking or I mean \u2013 I think just what do you prefer, sort of California's able to set their own stuff or if they pull back? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: What we ultimately would like is a one national program across the country. And we are going to remain committed to improving fuel economy, reducing emissions and working toward an all-electric future, but it is in, we believe, everybody's best interest to have one national set of requirement that comprehends the new technologies that we're putting in place and the increase in sharing of the \u2013 increase in \u2013 what the opportunity poses for autonomous vehicles. But one national standard is very important. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then last one on Cruise, as you think about the future \u2013 well, let me let me step back, so it seems like clearly as you're progressing towards this 2019 launch, you're sort of taking a do-it-all approach. But as you think about the longer-term potential for Cruise, if you got the technology to work, do you envision any scenarios whether it be for certain segments or certain geographies where you'd consider licensing out the technology? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Again \u2013 and I think you said it correctly, the key thing is to get the technology developed safely so we can deploy and validate that. And once we do that, we're going to look at any and all opportunities to really ramp up and maximize the use of the technology to drive shareholder value. So, we will be open to all opportunities. Key right now is getting the technology developed and be able to deploy safely. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : My first question is on trade. So, I think we've all explored how potential changes to the global trade environment could potentially be quite negative for GM, particularly around NAFTA. Has there also been though any scenario planning within GM that suggest that potential other changes to trade could actually shake out positively for you? I know GM management stands for free trade, but it seems to us that certain scenarios such as NAFTA remaining but Section 232 tariffs applying to imported vehicles from outside the NAFTA block, that could actually end up being quite positive for you from a pricing or share perspective? How are you thinking about the range of possibilities? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, the range of possibilities is almost infinite when you look at how many moving pieces there are. As you said, General Motors, we generally are free traders. We believe it's important to modernize NAFTA but we think it's important for the auto industry to have the right NAFTA agreements. What we've been focused on is providing input to the people in government across government and the administration and across countries to make sure they understand the complexities of the supply chain, the length of when we make investments. So, whatever moves are made can be done in a logical fashion. But again, we're very much focused on having the NAFTA agreement resolve. We think that's important. As we look at the opportunities that may come out of this as it shakes out with whether it's Section 232 or some of the other things that are being discussed, I think what our focus on is making sure we have the best products from a car, truck and crossover perspective that we're going to win in the marketplace. And obviously as those sort out and there's a lot of scenarios we're looking at but we're going to try to really make sure that we're going to be able to take advantage based on the strong product portfolio that we have. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I see. Thanks. And then on the currency headwinds you're seeing in South America, depending upon the performance of what was previously called consolidated IO, the headwinds there seem quite large given that International was softer while China was a record. So, can you kind of help us understand the magnitude maybe of those headwinds and what's driving it? I asked because last year you were only slightly profitable in South America. So, the lower currency translation of your EBIT profits there does not seem to explain the degree of the headwind. Are you may be having to like import certain components into Brazil and Argentina paid for with depreciated reals and pesos? And if so, are there any actions that you can take or that you are taking now to try to lessen that impact going forward? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, the net impact of the currency in GMI which was largely South America, in the second quarter was $200 million, broadly speaking. Significant devaluation of both the Argentinian peso and the Brazilian real. As I mentioned, when you look at this unmitigated for the year, just the South American piece you're talking somewhere close to $1 billion of exposure based on the current rates which had \u2013 pick a day, the Brazilian real has been at BRL 3.80 plus or minus, and the Argentinian peso at ARS 27.5. At the beginning of the year, it was BRL 3.15 and something around ARS 20. We can price and price aggressively in Argentina because it's a hyper inflationary environment, and we've been doing that. And as I said earlier, we would expect that there's a lag, but we would expect that to catch up assuming that there's some stability. Brazil's different. Brazil inflation is low. It's very, very difficult to pass those costs along. The solution in Brazil, assuming that these current \u2013 this exchange rate persists, which we don't believe it will, will be the execution of our GEM strategy because with the Global Emerging Market program which we're starting to launch now and we'll continue to launch over the next 12 to 18 months in South America, we're going to be much more localized. So, that's the path out of this. I think that everybody's got their point of view, but kind of the consensus view is once we move through the elections later this year and get some kind of clarity around the government in both Brazil and Argentina, the government policies and execution of some fiscal reform, that these currencies are going to recover, the biggest one that we're focused on obviously is Brazil, given the lack of pricing capability to offset the exchange. So, that is a long-winded answer, but I think it sized up Q2 in kind of what our view is for the rest of the year. Answered your question, Ryan? Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, it does. It's very helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly, quickly on metals, I heard in the prepared remarks that you expect the prices to remain high in the back half of the year. Steel prices, we can see clearly they were sharply higher in the quarter and they remain high. At the same time, the prices for some of the other metals that you're exposed to such as aluminum or copper, while they were also sharply higher in 2Q they appear to have significantly moderated after the quarter end just in the last few weeks here. So, the question is like what level of cost do you assume for metals in the back half? Do your assumptions reflect the level of cost you incurred in 2Q, the latest available spot prices or your own expectation of where they might trend going forward? Thanks. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. We look at a number of different indicators of commodity prices \u2013 one's spot, one is the bank forward rates, one is our own informed view based on all of these inputs. I think that obviously, we've seen the pullback in some of the aluminum pricing most recently. All of that is factored into our thinking. One of the things that you need to understand is there's a lag effect. We have at least a three-month lag from when the price moves to when it ultimately works its way through. So, that's why when you saw the run-up in pricing kind of in Q2, we had a net commodity headwind of $300 million in Q2. We see that playing out into the second half of the year because the run-up that we saw in Q2, we're going to feel the full effect of that in the second half of the year given that kind of three-month lag based on the supply chain. So, all of those are factored in, Ryan, including the recent back up in aluminum. And I would say our biggest exposure, our biggest unmitigated exposure is really steel and aluminum when you look at all of the commodities. And frankly, the biggest driver of that is steel. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good morning. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Hey. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Maybe a question on 2019 for Chuck, can you just update us on your latest thinking there? I think the original kind of outlook was for core EBIT to get better 2019 versus 2018. And then also how we should think about the kind of puts and takes on North America. Because I think your second half North America guidance implied about a 10% margin. So, does that kind of continue in 2019 with these headwinds and maybe talk a little bit about that? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Well, just a couple of comments, Itay. I'm not going to set guidance for 2019 because I won't be here to execute to it. So, it would be really easy for me to get aggressive and lean forward. But in all seriousness, I would say that the way I would think about 2019 is execution remains very strong. We continue to work to optimize those things that are in our control. We are in a very uncertain and volatile environment at this point in time and we're in the middle of 2018. But when you look at the truck launch and having a full year of light duty pickups next year, when you look at the continued strength that of GM Financial and the continued growth there, hopefully, some improvement in South America, I would say a foundation is there for us to continue to execute well, but I am not going to get out in front of my interference here given the macro environment and the uncertainty associated with that. We will continue to focus on strong execution and continuing to drive the improvement in those areas of the business that we've been talking about for the last number of years and I'm confident in whatever the macro backdrop is, we'll optimize results. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's helpful. And then on the T1 launch, I think you previously highlighted a $2 billion opportunity mostly in terms of revenue on the crew cab mix. How much of that do you think you'll get in the second half? And can you talk about what the rough incremental margin on that $2 billion opportunity might look like? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: You're going back to the \u2013 Ammann's chart at the Deutsche Bank Conference, right, as I recollect. And when we were looking at that, that was when you looked at kind of the K2 and some of the opportunities we have in the T1 vis-\u00e0-vis the K2. In other words the new entries up-level entries in both the Sierra and Silverado lines, removing the constraint that we had on crew cabs that we've seen in the past and I would say that is kind of like life cycle to life cycle opportunities. So, I wouldn't start booking benefit like that in the second half of 2018. I think that continues to build and will manifest itself in 2019 and 2020 as we move through the launch. Relative to 2018 second half, we're going to produce roughly 120,000 to 130,000 T1s. Obviously, they're going to be more profitable than the K2. And rich mix; rich mix because they're all crew cabs. But we're not going to see the full impact of that until 2019 and beyond. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. And then just lastly maybe a strategic question for Mary. With the announcements from Maven yesterday on peer-to-peer, can you talk about how the peer-to-peer sharing platform plays into GM's future AV strategy and even potentially EVs as you can maybe use that platform to make the monthly payment on an EV perhaps more compelling on a shared platform? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, Itay, I think you said it well. I mean, we have learned a tremendous amount with Maven in the different contracts whether it's Maven from a real estate perspective, Maven Home, what we've done in Ann Arbor with the City and then Maven Gig, and now this is the next installment with highlighting in the three cities the peer-to-peer. And we think especially with what General Motors has with our OnStar connection, it really allows for a pretty seamless way for people to make their car available to others and defer some of the costs. So, I think there will be people who do what you suggest and use it as a way to offset the cost of the vehicle and we also see it having a huge benefit from a Cap 8 on a regulatory perspective because once you use the vehicle more, we're demonstrating that a vehicle in a sharing environment and we've deployed a number of Chevrolet Volt EVs, is something that gets higher miles usage and therefore has a better impact on the environment. So, we're really excited about the peer-to-peer, learning about it in the three pilot cities, and then looking at what are the opportunities to expand from a current business today. And in many of the learnings we've already had for Maven that is being factored in and considered in our plans for Cruise. So again, good learning, continuing to expand, multiple benefits for the customer from a greenhouse gas perspective, and we see those learnings being leveraged in autonomous. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Guggenheim. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : I was hoping to come back to your first half to second half walk and specifically for GMNA. You're obviously assuming your very nice \u2013 or I guess a material improvement in both EBIT and margin for the second half, and you mentioned the factors behind that. I was just curious if you could just give an order of dimension for those for those factors because if my understanding is right you have commodities, that's where the lag will probably be a larger headwind in the second half, but then you have production up and then you have pricing which you expect to be stronger especially in the fourth quarter. So, any sense you can give us on dimensioning these factors? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Boy, I hesitate to do that because then, in Q3 and Q4, you'll be asking for a reconciliation of that. I would just say that when you look at \u2013 the biggest driver of the improvement, the biggest tailwind in the second half will be mix. We're going to be up roughly 100,000 crew cabs in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Second, the pricing dimension of that is pretty favorable, and I would put that in the zip code of $1 billion dollars of net price. And that's largely related to majors as well as typical model year 2019 pricing. So those two factors together are a significant $1 billion tailwind. Headwinds, overall, in the second half of the year overall volume is going to be down and you know that July and December are our shut down months, and we always have lower production in the second half. As I mentioned, cost is going to be up, call it in the $500 million to $600 million range. That's primarily engineering and D&A, launch-related. And then I would say the other piece of that, kind of the commodity headwind in the second half of the year unmitigated is several hundred million dollars. So, again if I'm just dimensioning those, the biggest positive driver is mix, followed by price, which will be partially offset by the biggest driver fundamentally being volume, typical second half seasonality launch-related costs, and then commodities. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : All right. That's extremely helpful. And then just following up on the commodities piece, so you're obviously seeing \u2013 been increasing steadily throughout the year your estimates for the headwind. I think when you first guided this in January, it was $200 million, $300 million. Now we're obviously talking about net $1 billion. If the prices stayed at current levels, what does that headwind look like in 2019? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Let me \u2013 if I could go back, Emmanuel, and provide a little bit more clarity, the $1 billion net headwind for the year is not all commodities. I would say, broadly speaking, the unmitigated headwind is roughly $300 million to $400 million of FX, largely the South American piece and the unmitigated commodities $600 million to $700 million. A big portion of that falls into North America, obviously, on the commodity piece of this. So, as we exit this year and go into next year, on a run rate basis you're talking about maybe something like a $0.5 billion in the second half of the year which would equate to $1 billion for a full year, just commodities. But it's early days and we need to see how all of these different factors, market forces that impact that play out and what other actions we can take to mitigate it. All we're seeing is with the significant run-up that we've seen in the second quarter, we just can't pull enough levers in the second half to offset that. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Yes. That's super helpful. And just very finally, I wanted to ask you a question on Lyft. I saw that you marked up the GM stake in Lyft. Just curious what is your stay course at this point? And also more strategically, what is your plan with Lyft both with the stake and in terms of working with them? We obviously noticed Dan left the board last month, and so, what can you tell us about the plans going forward? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Relative to the value of the Lyft investment, we don't disclose that. We did, obviously with their latest funding round, pick up a gain which was booked in the second quarter as you noted relative to the strategy. And I'll turn it over to Mary. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yes. So, again, we have a good relationship with Lyft. Other than drivers currently using the Maven Gig product, we don't have any formal joint projects going on right now. But as we have said, as we move into deploying AV vehicles, we're looking at will we deploy with one partner, two partners, or go on our own. So, I don't have anything further to share with plans with Lyft right now, but that's what we've said, and we continue to believe. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning. A question for you on the Cruise spend. Halfway through the year, we're at $300 million. You're still guiding to $1 billion. It implies a pretty significant ramp for 3Q, 4Q. What is that ramp associated with? Is that going to continue into 2019? So, call it $300-plus million per quarter is the right run rate, so maybe it's like $1.2 billion, maybe $1.5 billion burn in 2019. Just help us understand why it's starting to ramp, and why it hasn't yet. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Well, one, the Cruise spend, just Cruise, setting aside other movements in the Corp segment. I think we were somewhere in the zip code of $400 million in the first half of the year, but I'm not going to quibble on the round. Obviously, we're ramping up spending. We're hiring more engineers. There's more cost associated with the ramp-up. So, that's the spend rate to get to $1 billion in the second half of the year, and that's not inconsistent with our expectations. It wasn't going to be flat line in 2018. I think the best way to think about spend as we go exit 2018 and going to 2019, with the Softbank investment and our $1.1 billion alongside the initial $2 billion funding for Cruise. The expectation is that we'll be funding to get them to the commercial launch milestone which we've talked about in 2019. So, that will give you an indication. I mean if we expect to spend $600 million or $700 million from that point through the balance of this calendar year, we'll probably get another $1.3 billion roughly in 2019. But hey, if we need to spend an extra $200 million or $300 million to advance this, accelerate it, we'll do that. It's a great opportunity and right now that's just our current thinking. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, Chuck. And then thinking back to North America crossover segment, you guys were able to take share within the quarter but I think we tracked your incentives being up pretty substantially year-over-year. What are you seeing within that segment from your competitors? Is it going to get more competitive, more cash on the hood going forward or do you think you're going to be able to still maintain your kind of implied $7,000 of variable profit for a crossover? So, I think the original guide was for about $500 million of contribution from crossovers with an incremental $70,000 wholesales year-over-year? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes, I would say that when we look at the year so far and our expectations for the year, we're going to generate that kind of tailwind. I think what is driving that, there's a couple of different factors. One is we're performing better and our volume is better which is driving a bigger aggregate but the pricing dynamic is a little bit more challenging than we expected. And I think you almost need to look at this segment-by-segment, our mid-SUVs are strong and performing exceptionally well. The compact SUV segment is very, very competitive and I would expect \u2013 our baseline planning has that continuing to be very, very competitive and escalation in that. But again, the mid crossovers for us are performing really, really well, and we seem to be holding our own from a pricing perspective. But that $0.5 billion that we talked about earlier this year, that still holds, or could ultimately be slightly better than that. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And generally that's from volume? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just lastly, China JV margins were up year-over-year. It seems like we're going through maybe a bit of an air pocket in June, July. Can you walk us through how you're able to, I believe, probably take cost out, and if that's repeatable into the back half? And really, what the change in guidance is from kind of above $2 billion or at least $2 billion to now just $2 billion in JV equity income? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Again, big picture, we've been able over the last number of years unlike if you look at kind of the overall environment, unlike some of the competition, to maintain a pretty healthy level of equity income because of improved mix and cost efficiency. That drove the business results in the first half of the year largely. In addition, there was a favorable FX component in the first half of the year. The renminbi had strengthened versus last year and versus expectations. As we look at the second half of the year \u2013 we earned $1.2 billion of equity income in the first half of the year. When we look at the second half of the year, clearly, we're in a dynamic now where the renminbi is weaker, and whether or not it's related to all the trade situation and everything else, I'll let somebody else opine. We expect more competition in the luxury segment because there's a significant number of launches which will drive a bit of a headwind from a pricing perspective, and we're launching 10 new models in the second half of the year which will drive launch cost up. So, I would expect the second half to be down versus the first half. With that said, we still expect very strong equity income in China and it's going to be $2 billion-ish as we go through the year. We're still very, very constructive there, but let's see how some of these other issues play out. And I think importantly, as Mary noted in her opening comments, we've got a very strong position there, we've got a strong partnership that's been built over a number of years. But what's not built into our plan in the second half of the year is if things could change relative to that overall China relationship and sentiment vis-\u00e0-vis American companies. That's a pretty significant uncertainty depending on where some of these other trade discussions go. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Super helpful. Thank you very much for the detail, Chuck Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. The first question, just want to build off where you ended there, Chuck. On the potential anti-U.S. sentiment in China. I agree, I actually think that's the hardest to define, but single biggest risk facing GM or brands in China, especially if you look at the experience of Japanese and Koreans when there were similar kinds of national disputes and territorial disputes. Any sign of that right now or is this just \u2013 I know it's not on the numbers, but anything you're seeing all? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: No. We have not seen any of that yet. And obviously, we're very cognizant of what happened to the Japanese and the Koreans and certainly have thought through those potential implications. But again, it starts with a very, very strong relationship with our partner. But we have not seen anything yet. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. The second question is for Mary and on SoftBank. Mary, first of all, I want to \u2013 as on the side, thank you for your very, very thoughtful message on Sergio. I thought that was 100% class, and it meant a lot to a lot of people including me, Mary. So, SoftBank relationship with Uber, you've been developing the relationship more deeply with Uber kind of pulling away at least ostensibly from the outside, from Lyft, understandably these things move on. I guess what are you \u2013 are investors wrong to read into that there could be a number of commercial technological business opportunities within the SoftBank-Uber relationship that may be accelerating now post the investment in Cruise? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think we're going to do, at GM Cruise, what's in the best interest of the General Motors shareholder. And so, I'd like to think that we have a good relationship in the United States with both Lyft and Uber and across the globe with many of the other ride-sharing companies. Clearly, having the relationship and the investment from SoftBank does give us an opportunity to more directly look at opportunities with some of the different ride-sharing companies that they're involved in around the world, although many of those we already had strong relationships before. So, again we're just \u2013 this is a very dynamic space right now. It all gets gated and really the value gets created when you have the technology developed that you can deploy and meet the safety standards. But we're considering many, many options, and I think it's one of the assets that comes with the SoftBank relationship that we formed. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And maybe my last one back to Chuck, the Korean situation, I'm sorry if I missed anything in the prepared remarks, but could you just appraise us on where we are in terms of timing of one-off costs as you rationalize capacity there? And any delta and ongoing profitability as a result of those charges and the efforts with the union and the resources there? Thanks. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Sure. The vast majority of the charges actually rolled through our Q1 results. We had a tail effect which we expected of a couple hundred million dollars that rolled through in Q2. It was the final tranche of the VSPs and some supplier-related claims associated with the restructuring and again that was all consistent. There was a fairly significant cash impact in the second quarter as we ultimately paid the separation payments to the employees roughly $700 million. So, I'd say as we move through Q2, this is \u2013 the costs itself are largely behind us. As we talked about before, at an enterprise level, the run rate benefit associated with the restructuring there, both the Gunsan closure, the concessions that we negotiated with the union, et cetera, are in the zip code of $400 million a year. And we would expect to see some of that roll through starting in the third quarter and ramping after that and getting the run rate in 2019, that's broadly speaking. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. That's very clear, Chuck, and thanks, everybody. Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. I have a couple of questions. First, it's primarily on GMNA raw mats. When you say raw materials, it sounds like you're including both direct purchases from steel and aluminum suppliers, mills, as well as what's indexed on your supplier contracts. A, is that correct? And B, given that GM in the bad old days used to try to renegotiate the contract with suppliers and get some of those commodity costs saves down, how are you thinking about that relationship with those indexed commodity costs this time? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. The answer to your first question is it's the broad index of product and steel. And I would also broaden that to say when we talk about commodities/raw material that also includes oil-based like resins and diesel and all of those input costs that go in. The biggest driver though, going back to what I talked about before, at least the unexpected or accelerated pressure is really on the steel side of the business. So, lookit, three, four years ago, five years ago, we embarked on a path with our suppliers around having a more strategic long term relationship and working constructively and proactively instead of what we used to do in the past. And I think that that has been very, very beneficial for us when you think about our relationship, when you think about the opportunity to drive continued productivity, when you think about opportunities across the value chain, one input is cost, one input is efficiency, one input is warranty, one input is looking at global footprint and supporting us where we want to go, and I think we're going to continue that relationship. Where there's an opportunity to try to mitigate some of these headwinds through discussions and negotiating with suppliers, we're going to do that. But our first and foremost approach isn't to just go back to the suppliers and say no, right. As a matter of fact, index flows through, and then we'll work with suppliers to see what we can do to mitigate that through efficiency. On the flip side, the vast majority of our raw materials are not indexed. And clearly, there's pressure from suppliers on that side of it to escalate the component costs, take that into account, and we've been very, very proactive working with suppliers to try to mitigate that as well and we'll continue to do that. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Second question, over to trade. One of the proposals on the table and maybe light at the end of the NAFTA tunnel is to move to 40% high wage content on NAFTA vehicles coming up from Mexico obviously with the Canada, U.S. rates that already apply there. Can you give us a sense of what your content is currently? And then if that did go through, what you would be thinking about either in your factories or your supply chain to hit that content level? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, I'm not going to get into the details of where we are from that level. But what I will share is we are working closely with the trade representatives to make sure that we maintain an overall cost base that allows us to be competitive globally and to help understand the intricacies of that. So, I'm not going to give you specific details. We're well aware of it, assessing it, and providing quite a bit of input. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And I guess as just a final question, Mary, on that note, with the sad departure of Sergio from the auto scene, are you stepping up as sort of the senior CEO in auto land who's been around the political world for a while to sort of fill some of that gap? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, clearly I'm going to do what I think is on the best interest of General Motors and in the best interest of all of our shareowners and that is my focus. And we work with our trade association to try, where we can, to come to an agreement to have a strong and appropriate voice into the administration, into governments around the world. But I think that's more for others to decide, not me. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Can you provide any color on what you could do if tariffs were imposed particularly since I know you have a lot of production down in Mexico, and that would be potentially a risk under Section 232? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I would say, there's almost an infinite number of things that could happen and what exactly would be a part of it. So, I'm not going to hypothesize on a broad base of a Section 232 or something specific with NAFTA. I would just again focus on the fact that I think it's in everyone's best interest to have a strong U.S. auto industry. It's a big provider of quality jobs. And we're also an industry that has high capital investment, so you don't move things on a dime, and making sure \u2013 and we've spent a lot of time with the administration and the appropriate departments to make sure everybody understands that. And we believe that there's a path for NAFTA to get resolved in some of these other issues and we're going to continue on that path. Clearly, if there's something specific comes out, we will respond quickly to the fullest extent that we can. But I think right now we're more focused on providing the right input so there's a right understanding made and things don't happen with \u2013 decisions aren't made that have unintended consequences that don't serve anybody. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Any color on what, if you have \u2013 20% has been thrown out there as a tariff, I mean, what would that mean for your overall cost and interest? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yes, again, as I've spent a lot of time on trade in this last several months, there's a lot of intricacies and details that really matter and drive what will be the end impact. So, I really can't speculate on something like that. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Any color on Corporate/Other, it's been strong year-to-date? I think you mentioned Lyft revaluation was the help in the quarter. How much was that on the quarter? And what are the other items that are helping there, just kind of a broad bucket? Charles K. Stevens - General Motors Co.: Yes. The benefit from Lyft in the quarter was about $140 million, the revaluation associated with Lyft. We also had some improvement in our PSA recall from the transaction that we did last year. We have warrants and those get mark-to-market every quarter depending on what happens to PSA's stock price and, obviously, they've been on a favorable trajectory. Those would be the two biggest drivers of what we've seen so far, Colin, year-to-date and in the second quarter. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just lastly, I mean any thoughts on the already announced tariffs in China? Does that actually create an opportunity for you? Some of your competitor luxury products will get some pretty large tariffs and you're pretty localized in Cadillac. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: We're pretty localized across the board. We're the only vehicle that \u2013 right now \u2013 our general strategy is build where we sell. And so, we have a lot of manufacturing capability in China. There are some iconic Chevy products that we send there. And then of course the Buick Envision is sent here although it's important to note on the Buick Envision, the majority of Buick Envisions are sold in China. It's very strong in that market. And it wouldn't be something that we'd capitalize here so it's just something like bringing the low quantity or low volume of Buick Envisions that we bring here provides customer choice. And we think that's important as well to round up the portfolio and to do that efficiently. But again, we generally are building most of the products we sell there. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I want to thank everybody for participating. And I want to note, we are working hard executing our plan and we are committed to managing this business with focus, discipline and integrity. Our business fundamentals and our execution remain strong. We are optimistic about the industry, our strong portfolio of cars, trucks and SUVs, our position in key markets and in the technology and leadership that we have demonstrated in many aspects of the future of personal mobility. Our new crossovers and SUVs are growing sales and share in an increasingly competitive segments, and we're excited about the financial opportunities that our new full-sized trucks provide for the rest of the year and into 2019 and beyond. At the same time, we are connecting with like-minded investors and partners to commercialize self-driving vehicles and to realize an all-electric future. Before I close, I do want to recognize Chuck for his four decades of service and dedication to this company. And I also want to congratulate Dhivya on her new role as EVP and CFO, as well as Rocky Gupta who becomes the Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. I think we all know that Chuck has played a very big part in developing and executing our core and future business strategies. In addition, he has been a very important and trusted advisor to me and I know he has strong relationships with many of you. With Dhivya's strong leadership skills and experience. I am confident that she and her team will build on the results that Chuck has been a major driver of, and help us continue to build and drive success and shareholder value. But I do want to say Chuck, thank you very, very much. So, as I close, I want to leave you with this, even with the recent macroeconomic challenges, I continue to be confident about this company's ability to create long-term shareholder value and a safer, better and more sustainable world for our customers and that's what we're committed to do as we execute our zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion vision. So, thank you all for participating. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

Welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, October 31, 2018. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Dorothy. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2018. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; and Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and a number of other executives. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Rocky, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining. Our performance in the quarter was strong, demonstrating our determination to deliver strong business results in a dynamic environment, while also focusing on the innovation that will drive our work in the future of mobility. Looking at the numbers, we achieved a net revenue of $35.8 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $3.2 billion, EBIT-adjusted margin of 8.8%, EPS diluted adjusted of $1.87 and our return on invested capital adjusted of 25.6%. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $400 million. In the quarter, we capitalized on the high demand in the crossover, luxury and truck segments in addition to record performance by GM Financial. As we continue to strengthen our automotive vehicle business with recently-announced partnership between Honda, GM, GM Cruise to develop and deploy a purpose-built autonomous ride-share vehicle, based on the current rate of iteration, we continue to target commercialization in 2019 in a dense urban environment with safety as our gating metric. Now let's turn to North America, where in the U.S. our go-to-market strategy drove record Q3 average transaction prices. In Q4, we intend to stay disciplined, but we will compete for every sale with our freshest products in years, including our all new full-size pickups. We entered the quarter with lean inventories of our 2018 model year full-size pickups and focused on selling a very strong mix of SUVs, crossovers and midsize pickups with lower incentives. We expect retail sales volumes will increase in Q4 and beyond as we ramp up production of our new pickups. The launch of our new trucks continues to be ahead of schedule and response to our truck-for-every-customer strategy has been positive. Sales of the new high-margin Chevrolet Silverado LTZ and High Country crew-cab models are more than 30% above forecast, and the new GMC Sierra SLT, Denali and AT4 crew-cab models are selling within two weeks. Popularity of our new crossovers from Chevrolet, Buick and GMC continues as the sales of Traverse, Enclave and Terrain grew in competitive segments. Cadillac's product offensive continued in September with the launch of the all-new XT4 luxury SUV in North America and China. The brand is capitalizing on Chinese consumers' growing preference for luxury vehicles with sales in China up 20% year-to-date. Cadillac is introducing a new model every six months through 2020s, including the upcoming three-row XT6 SUV. Moving to China, where we have more than 20 years of strong market presence, we achieved record third-quarter equity income. This performance results from an improved mix of vehicle sales and a continued focus on cost and productivity improvements. Our earnings have been resilient as we benefit from the growth of important brands like Cadillac and Baojun. As we focus on electrification and launch future vehicle programs, we have opportunities to continue to improve our competitive position. During two visits to China this month, I've had a chance to take a closer look at the macro conditions affecting industry performance. The recent weakness has been more significant in Tier 3 through 5 markets that have less of an impact on our financial performance in the third quarter. Additionally, our growing strength in luxury and premium segments helps offset the impact of the industry weakness. We continue with our plan to introduce 10 new and refreshed models in the second half of the year, including the Cadillac XT4, the Baojun E200 BEV, the Chevrolet Orlando MPV and the Wuling Rong Guang in the third quarter. In addition, in our international operations, we are beginning to realize cost reductions as a result of our restructuring actions in Korea. And in South America, we have managed the effects of foreign exchange headwinds as we continue to drive efficiency into the business and we remain very confident in the strength of our Chevrolet brand there. As we look forward through the rest of the year, we expect full-year EPS to be at the top of our previously-communicated guidance range with potential for further upside. This is due to our strong operating performance and a favorable tax rate outlook for the year. Before I turn the call over to Dhivya, I want to assure our owners that we are focused on creating shareholder value. As we closeout 2018 and prepare for 2019, we are committed to improving all aspects of the business by accelerating the pace and driving capital efficiencies due to our global vehicle development process improvements, while allowing us to continue to improve quality and speed to market, and by taking steps to transform the workforce to ensure we have the right skill sets for today and the future, while also driving significant efficiency. We will continue to update you on our progress in the near term. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Mary. Our execution was extremely strong in the third quarter even as we faced expected challenges from commodity pricing and significant currency devaluations in South America. As a result of our focused and disciplined execution, we generated $35.8 billion in net revenue, $3.2 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.8% margin, and $1.87 in EPS diluted adjusted, which is a Q3 record. Favorable tax rate and performance of PSA warrants contributed to approximately $0.30 of EPS impact, while our strong operating performance contributed to the remainder. Q3 adjusted automotive free cash flow improved by $1.3 billion year-over-year net of our decision to opportunistically pre-fund $600 million of certain mandatory contributions related to our international pension plans. Let's take a look at North America. GMNA generated $2.8 billion of EBIT-adjusted and 10.2% margins, up 190 basis points year-over-year. The execution of the all-new full-size pickup truck launch is going very well. We produced 45,000 trucks in Q3 and expect to deliver another 75,000 to dealers in Q4, consisting primarily of highly-profitable crew-cab. This contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter. Our crossovers continue to perform across every vehicle segment. We will continue this momentum into 2019 with the launch of our all-new Blazer. As a result of matching supply with demand and disciplined pricing, passenger car results improved year-over-year in Q3. Light-duty pickup performance combined with our crossover and passenger car results more than offset mix and downtime taken in Q3 for heavy duty trucks, which positions us well as we head into 2019. And as expected, commodity headwinds and increased vehicle content for newly-launched vehicles was partially offset by strong material performance. Moving to GM International, EBIT-adjusted performance in GMI was down $300 million year-over-year driven by significant devaluation of the Argentine peso and Brazilian real. China delivered record Q3 results with equity income of $500 million for the quarter. As Mary mentioned, this was driven by cost performance, as well as strong mix of vehicles led by record Cadillac sales, which offset challenges from continued pricing pressure. A few comments on GM Financial, GM Cruise and our Corp segment. As we continue to progress towards full captive, GM Financial posted an all-time quarterly record revenue of $3.5 billion and record third quarter earnings before tax adjusted of $500 million. Credit and residual performance remained constructive. As a result of strong performance, we have initiated an ongoing dividend payment from GM Financial. In the fourth quarter of this year, GM Financial will pay a dividend of $375 million, well ahead of our original plan. Through dividends from GMF, we have the opportunity to strengthen the long-term cash generation capability and narrow the gap between earnings and free cash flow on an ongoing basis. GM Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million as we continue progressing towards commercialization. We expect to spend approximately $1 billion in GM Cruise for the full year. Corp segment costs in the quarter were better than expected, primarily due to continued favorability from valuation of our PSA warrants. We expect the Corp segment cost to be lower than the full-year expectation of $1 billion. We project our 2018 full year effective tax rate to be approximately 17% as a result of fluctuation in earnings geographies and favorable resolution of various tax positions. Moving on to our outlook for the full year. Due to our strong operating performance and favorable tax rate outlook for the year, we expect the full-year EPS to be at the top of our previously-communicated guidance range with potential for further upside. In North America, we continue to expect a full-year EBIT adjusted margin of 9% to 10% as we launch our all-new full-size trucks, while we still experience commodity-driven headwinds. In China, we continue to expect strong equity income of approximately $2 billion this year. With the majority of our launches occurring later in the year, we expect higher launch costs in the fourth quarter. Moving to South America, we continue to monitor and work to offset the impact of currency volatility. The structural cost actions we've taken have lowered our break-even point by approximately 40% relative to where we were just a few years ago, and our underlying franchise remains very strong. Regarding GM Financial, while we will experience traditional seasonality in Q4, we continue to expect significant year-over-year profit growth. And we continue to expect core automotive free cash flow of approximately $4 billion before the impact of pre-funding non-U.S. pension contributions. So, to sum up the quarter, our Q3 performance is a demonstration of the team navigating through a challenging environment and delivering very strong results. As Mary mentioned, we're intensely focused on improving our cash generation. Following our new architectural launches, we expect a meaningful decline in future capital spending. Combined with the ongoing GM Financial dividend and our focus on cost reduction, we see significant opportunity to improve cash generation. We are confident in the opportunities ahead of us and continue to expect strong performance over the short term as well as the long term. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations, everyone. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Itay. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: First, Dhivya, just to clarify on the GMF dividend of $3.75 in Q4, is that going to be \u2013 kind of sustainable at that quarterly rate going forward? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, Itay, we do expect that this will be an annual dividend. The exact amount will be driven by leverage ratio at GMF as we go forward. And when we get to a full-captive state early in 2020s, we expect that the entire net income from GMF will be dividended up to the parent. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. And then as we think about your progress going into 2019, love to get the latest sense on commodity costs directionally as you renegotiate some of the one-year contracts, as well as just the ability of the business to continue to offset as you've been able to do, of course, here in Q3, in terms of the opportunities you're seeing to offset some of these headwinds. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, Itay, we had mentioned on the last call that on an unmitigated basis we see a $1 billion year-over-year impact in 2019 over 2018. Again, I would reiterate that that number was based on the spot prices that existed at the time of our second quarter earnings call and there's been puts and takes since then. There's some tailwinds in commodities. There's some headwinds in the form of tariffs and so on. But I think net-net, you should think about it as that number continues to be valid on an unmitigated basis. But as we think of 2019, you should look at that in the context of all the other puts and takes we have, including largely completing the transition of our light duties. And, as I mentioned, we have taken downtime already in 2018 as it relates to our heavy duties. So, we do not anticipate a significant year-over-year volume decline in our heavy duties, so that should help offset as well. So, think of commodities in the context of the broader overall picture that's happening. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And then just maybe lastly on GMI, kind of your latest thoughts there. Maybe a year ago at this time we thought GMI would move to profitability. Maybe an update on the GEMs platform and the Korea restructuring and kind of how you're thinking about that segment now in the next couple of years excluding China. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: I think as I indicated from a Korea perspective, we're starting to see the cost savings flow in. A lot of those were in this segment, so we see that and are very much on track for what we communicated as it relates to the Korea restructuring. I think when you look, there's progress being made in each of those markets, but GEM doesn't launch until next year and so that becomes an opportunity there. We have continued in South America to improve the business, taking additional costs out, have a very strong franchise there. So, we see improvement coming across the board in GMI. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. That's all very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to turn to the free cash, I mean, originally you were saying $4 billion for the year. Then, you have the $600 million discretionary pension. Now, you're adding back $375 million. So, where do you think we should end up here for the full year? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, Joe, I think about our free-cash-flow guidance as consistent with the $4 billion that we alluded to in the second quarter. If you look at the pension pre-funding, again, we took the opportunity to risk manage that and get some of the mandatory contributions over with in 2018. But if you look at the underlying cash-generation capability of our core business, it remains at that $4-billion level, which is very strong. And as we look into Q4, we expect that quarter to be where we are going to generate a significant portion of our cash. It's going to be a very strong free-cash-flow quarter. So, I think about it as free-cash-flow guidance remains intact, as well as the ongoing GMF dividend initiation. You're going to see the impact of that as we go forward into 2019 and beyond. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So, just the $4 billion inclusive of the pension. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: The $4 billion is before the mandatory contributions. It's $3.4 billion net of pensions. We guided to $4 billion on a core automotive basis and that continues to be the cash-generation capability. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then just in GMNA, I think in the past you were sort of pointing us towards that fourth quarter would be the strongest quarter of the year. Obviously, there was good performance here in the third quarter. Is that still the case or was there some timing between the two quarters? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: We expect fourth quarter to continue to remain strong, Joe, and the favorability we're seeing in Q3 as it relates to our T1 launch should continue into Q4. From a factory unit sale perspective, we expect that Q3 and Q4 will be roughly in \u2013 Q4 will be roughly in line with last year and Q4 will actually be up versus Q3 from a factory unit sale perspective. We're continuing to expect strong crew cab penetration within our sales as well. So, if you overall look at the 9% to 10% guidance for North American margins, I would expect Q4 to be on the higher end of that range. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. And then just last quickly. In China, I know there was this over 3-million-unit recall. Does that impact that guidance at all? And if so, in which quarter? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: No. No. From a \u2013 it was not a material impact. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: And it's happening \u2013 underway right now. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache - Wolfe Research : Good morning, everybody. Congratulations. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks, Rod. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Rod Lache - Wolfe Research : I was hoping to get a little bit more color on China. Your wholesales this quarter were down 4%. I think your retail was down 15%. So, I was hoping maybe you can give us a sense of the components of the earnings bridge and how things are playing out. So, in other words, if we were to have a plus or minus 5% from volume, what does that imply for the impact on GM? And what do you have kind of in the pipeline in terms of positive mix that's offsetting that? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, so, typically, Rod, just from an earnings bridge perspective, we experience about mid-single digit type pricing pressure on a yearly basis in China. And on a high level, how I would think about that is, offset roughly half by mix and half by cost. And that's sort of been the trend over the last several years and what we're seeing from a mix perspective, especially as Mary mentioned, as we launch our new Cadillac entries here, that's been particularly strong. And from a volume perspective I think it's important to highlight where the volume comes from, would have a different impact on profitability. For example, Tier 3 to 5 where we're seeing a bunch of the weakness that Mary alluded to, that tends to be our less profitable portion of the market. Tier 1 to 2, we're seeing less of a decline there and luxury, again, the market is actually up year-over-year. So from an overall puts and takes perspective, I would continue to think about this as a strong performance in cost as well as mix continuing to be a tailwind from a Cadillac perspective as we continue our launches. Rod Lache - Wolfe Research : Can you provide us with some kind of a sensitivity at this point on average for what a 5% move in volume would be? You guys have done that in the past. But this obviously has changed a lot. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, it's, again, difficult to predict because it matters where it comes from as well. So I wouldn't go into that level of detail. And as I mentioned, it's too mix-dependent. So if you're in a backdrop where volumes are declining but, again, luxury is holding up, you get a different answer. So it's hard to handicap that. Rod Lache - Wolfe Research : Okay. And can you just give us your kind of high level, maybe 30,000-foot view on China? There's been a lot of discussion lately about a stimulus of some kind that's maybe coming, maybe a purchase tax cut. Obviously, there are a lot of other elements that are going on in China as well vis-a-vis credit and so forth. So, how do you see this playing out from a high level? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Obviously, Rod, we're watching it very closely as I mentioned. I've been there twice in the last month and we have a very strong joint venture in China with SAIC and have very strong brands. We're seeing growth in Chevrolet. We're seeing very good growth from a Cadillac perspective and we have a very good launch cadence of products coming out that are getting really strong reception from consumers. We have not seen any negative view toward our brands and I think that's very positive. So I think we continue \u2013 we have an organization there that is extremely disciplined on taking costs out and seizing opportunities to improve our go-to-market and then the products that we have from a mix perspective. So, we're watching it carefully and we're very hopeful that both sides will have dialog and get to the table to work through some very important issues that both China and the United States have as it relates to trade. And we're hopeful that will \u2013 there will be a foundation laid and they'll continue to do that. But I think when we look at our positioning, we have many levers that we can pull to continue to have strong performance in China. Rod Lache - Wolfe Research : But at a high level, are you expecting China to recover at some point as a result of \u2013 I understand that there's some company-specific positives, but are you expecting China to start to look a little bit better as some of the stimulus measures start to have an effect? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: We're watching that closely. I can't predict. We all read the article that came out that they're considering the incentives. Obviously, that would be a very good measure from an industry perspective. But I don't know \u2013 I can't comment if that's going to happen or not. I think they're looking at it closely and we expect to see actions taken that are going to allow the market to continue to be \u2013 I wouldn't say maybe growth that we saw a few years back, but continue to be at a important level. And let's not forget, even at a 27-million-type unit market, it's the largest market in the world. Rod Lache - Wolfe Research : Okay. And just lastly, was hoping you can just describe how you're setting the level of a dividend from GMF, that business is now starting to generate something like $2 billion a year of earnings. So to the extent that you're not dividend-ing that all out, obviously you're building the equity base there. Is that something that gets ratcheted up over time? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, that's correct, Rod. So the way we set the dividend level is a number of factors but primarily driven by leverage ratio at GMF. We have a managerial leverage ratio target of 10 times earning assets to equity and we're still growing the business. The year-over-year rate of growth is starting to stabilize but it's still growing. And as we think about the balance sheet leveling out in a couple of years down the line, that's when you will expect that the net income from GMF will be fully dividended to the company. And what we've done basically here is taken advantage of the fact that our strong performance at GMF has contributed to a lower leverage ratio than what's in our managerial target. So we're taking advantage of the upside there to be able to start the dividends early. Rod Lache - Wolfe Research : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, everybody. Just a couple of questions. First, on China strategy, the BMW Brilliance arrangement where BMW increased its stake as JV to 75%, that kind of caught the market's attention. I was just wondering from the lens of GM in China, are you satisfied with your 50% type stakes in your JVs there or is there a potential to take this higher, given now you have the opportunity, as part of maybe a broader plan to change internal combustion capacity to electrics in that region. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So, Adam, we have I think the strongest partner in China with SAIC. We've \u2013 through the past 20 years have worked together quite well \u2013 doing work such as the joint development of the GEM product as well as our work on the next generation of the electric vehicle. So, I think we have a very appropriate relationship and at this current time we're not looking to change the 50/50 structure. It's served us well and I think the strength of our results demonstrate that. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Mary. Just one follow-up on electric vehicles. So, you currently sell one pure EV at least in the U.S. right now, the Volt, sales are down around 17% year-to-date. I think you're annualizing maybe around 16,000 units, that's just for the U.S. market. I realize you do sell it globally. But just on the U.S., Tesla makes about as many Model 3s in three weeks as your whole year worth of Volt sales in the States. So, I guess the question is, when are we going to see \u2013 when could we expect to see \u2013 and again, taking nothing away from the efforts of the Volt and really you stand apart from a lot of your Detroit brethren from really going heavy on EV, so I think it is an appropriate question to say given your lead and your experience with this technology, when can we see GM bring out like a couple hundred thousand unit type product that could really clean house in the ride-sharing fleets and turn heads and be a real headache for Tesla? Thanks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Adam, thanks for the recognition on the Chevrolet Volt EV. We have announced that we are increasing capacity there. We've been opportunistic as to what markets we are allowing the current production to go to, but I think you'll see our sales in the United States increase. And although I don't have a specific announcement to your question, we have announced that we have several EVs coming in the next few years, so we believe in an all-electric future. I think you'll see that will roll out over the next couple of years. And then very importantly, we're working on our next generation, which we're calling EME 1.0, that we're looking to make sure we have EVs that are affordable, obtainable, desirable and have the right range. We're also working actively from an infrastructure on several fronts to make sure that the charging infrastructure is there to support the growth of EVs. And even most recently, which was announced, we're working with Delco Electronics on a fast-charging technology because I think as we look at it from a customer perspective, what do they need to really get the growth to make the EV their only car as opposed to their third, fourth or fifth car. You need to solve the charging infrastructure. Fast-charging is a big piece of it. So we're very optimistic and we're 100% committed but I'm not going to \u2013 I don't have specific volume announcements to make today. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Mary. Thanks, team. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Good morning. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Good morning. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a first question on slide 11 on the North American bridge. Probably, I think the most important thing in the quarter is that you got positive pricing on carryovers, as well as majors. I think that's probably the first time I've seen that in 20-plus years of looking at your financials. What's going on with the pricing there? I mean, that's a wild positive action that you were able to get positive pricing on carryovers. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, John, it's across the board I would say. If you look at the components of that, a lot of our recently-launched crossovers are now falling in the carryover category, so we continue to see pricing strength there, especially in the mid-SUV segment. We have remained disciplined from a passenger-car perspective as well, as we have matched supply and demand. So, I would say it's not just in one area, John. It's across the board. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And Dhivya, do you think this is the kind of action, though, that could be sustainable going forward? This isn't sort of a one-time blip, this is a real focus and change in philosophy? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Look, you'll see it, obviously, go up and down every quarter, but our intent is absolutely to stay disciplined. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's great. Then, second, as we look at the rise in rates, there's a lot of concern around what that's going to do to the value chain, particularly on the demand side, but it's helpful on pensions. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing on sort of pension pre-measurements and funding status and really thoughts there, Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, on that, John, absolutely a rising rate environment tends to be a tailwind for pensions. Especially in the U.S. we have made a ton of progress in closing our underfunded gap over the last several years and we remain leveraged to the upside as rates increase. I think important thing to note is the mandatory pension contributions in the U.S. do not start until the mid-2020s, so you're really talking about a good seven, eight years of a runway here for us to benefit from potential market moves before we're going to have to take any mandatory contribution actions. But, again, we're risk managing this. We're making sure that we're also downside protected as we move forward. But, you're right, we'll see tailwinds there. And we remeasure pensions, as you know, at the end of the year, so we'll have more to say when we report our calendar-year earnings. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And can you also just remind us when we think about the demographics of the work, the active workforce, how many are legacy workers and how many are your entry levels? What's the mix right now roughly? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: No. I don't have... Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: I think it's about roughly 50/50, we should say. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Okay. Yeah, and we can confirm that. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yes. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly, Mary. When you talk about safety as the gating factor on the Cruise commercialization and real widespread launch, how do you measure that safety? I mean, obviously, not hitting things is obviously a very critical one. That's a very simple one for us to see. But not to make light of this, but I mean how do you really get comfortable with sort of the risks in the real world? Because they're always going to be out there, particularly when we're in a world of some of these regular human crazy drivers that the cars have to deal with. I mean, how do you think about that and when do you just let it go? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think the fact that we're doing our development in downtown San Francisco gives us probably the most exposure to those types of situations, not only drivers but bikes and all sorts of activities. We did release our kind of guide to safety that was part of the guidelines that NHTSA is looking for. But I would say we've also \u2013 and we haven't released details because we think it's a competitive advantage. We have done extensive work to understand how we will measure through actual road performance, simulation. We've gone back and looked at historical patterns as it relates to safety and we have a very well-defined plan of what we have to demonstrate to demonstrate that the AV is safer than a human driver, and that's the path that we're on. And so, when we talk about gated by safety, we are measuring ourselves against that plan that also had external input. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And that gate will get lifted with the commercialization in 2019; is that a fair statement or assumption? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Yes. So, our intent is based on the progress and the rate of iteration that we're making that we see a path to be able to do that. But as we demonstrated with Super Cruise, we will make sure we hit our safety metrics before we launch and commercialize. But right now, the rate of iteration says that we're believing we can do that in 2019. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, great. Really good looking quarter. Want to dig into a thread from earlier on free cash flow, because I think there's some confusion on this. The original guidance was for, the last quarter's guidance, was for $4 billion. You took a $600 million prepayment contribution on pensions, so roughly $3.4 billion. Does that $3.4 billion include the dividend from GMF? Or would that be on top of the $3.4 billion, getting you back to around that $4 billion? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: It includes that, David. What we were not able to preannounce was the dividend because we had not \u2013 the GMF Board of Directors had not declared it at that point, but it was contemplated in our guidance. So you're correct, $4 billion core automotive free cash flow generation. When we pre-fund the pension piece, that comes down to $3.4 billion, both of which already contemplate the GMF dividend. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Just under-communicated. Understood. On the Cruise Automation spend, this year you're only about $500 million. I know I've asked this like two or three quarters in a row now. You're still expecting $1 billion for the year. What's the ramp-up that you're going to be seeing that you're going to double year-to-date spend in the fourth quarter? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So we are hiring and continuing to do that development to the plan. Right now, we're looking at still we'll be roughly around $1 billion as we previously communicated, but the team is being smart about it and if they can achieve what they need to achieve at a lower level, they will. But we're still holding at that level and it's due to a lot of hiring and continued work from \u2013 accumulating miles and experience. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. But there's not like a large increase in the fleet that's coming or an expansion in a new city that's going to drive that incremental spend? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: No. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Because that's all we can think of that could kind of get you there. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: No. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then for the quarter, commodities headwind in North America was $300 million. I know this was asked a little bit earlier, $1 billion for next year unmitigated. What was this quarter's gross unmitigated and how much were you able to essentially mitigate? Just trying to get a sense of how effective you've been. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: So I would just \u2013 from a bridge perspective, you can see that for the total company we experienced $400 million of commodity headwinds. And what we've been trying to do, David, as you're aware, we have our $6.5 billion target that we committed to in 2014 as it relates to commercial and technical savings and we've been continuing to execute on that and we remain on track to achieve that by the end of this year. And you see material performance in our bridge of $300 million that serves to offset some of the commodity headwinds we're talking about and obviously there's broader puts and takes outside of commodities as well where we've seen strength in a number of other areas that have offset commodities. And looking into 2019, again, too early. Our purchasing team is having those discussions as we speak and we'll have more to share early next year. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. To clarify that point, though, earlier in the year you talk about gross impact and what the mitigated impact was and I believe this $400 million is the mitigated impact. What would have been the gross impact for the quarter before you took any mitigating factors? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Just to clarify, the over $1 billion stands at over $1 billion still. So we had $1.4 billion and we're roughly in that zip code currently from a commodity headwind perspective and $400 million is what you're seeing of that $1-ish billion flowing through in this particular quarter and the mitigation is after that and which is the $300 million of material performance that you see flow through in our bridge. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Very clear. Thank you very much. Great looking quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thanks. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Sure. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Firstly, another one on China. The latest speculation as was discussed is that the sales could rise from here if the government reduces the purchase tax on new vehicles and I hope that does happen. I wanted to ask, though, if you have done downturn planning in that country similar to what you have done in the U.S. So, for example, in the event that there were a material downturn in China, I know there hasn't been before, but something on the order of magnitude of like 25% peak to trough like you discussed in the U.S., what would that mean for your operations there? Do you think you would be profitable in that type of a scenario? I think you would be given you just generated a record profit on a 15% volume decline. But curious if you could dimension how a material downturn might impact you in that region and if it is any harder or easier to pull cost levers on, say, the people side in China in comparison to, say, in North America. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: So we have done that planning at both a moderate and severe levels. That's something that I just reviewed this past week and it's something we update on a continual basis. It's hard to completely quantify it based on tell me what's driving it, tell me what the mix will be, where's the impact most from a Tier 1 to Tier 5 city perspective. But we have done that with a wide range of sensitivity analysis based on those factors. So I can't really share a specific number. We do have flexibility with the workforce. As you know from a U.S. perspective, one of the things that benefited us from the 2015 contract was the ability to have a more-flexible workforce and so we are \u2013 every year we grow and have I would say that increases from a North America perspective. We have that with the workforce in China as well especially as we look at the temporary workforce that we have there. So been very well modeled, continually monitored. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And can you just speak to the degree to which the record GM Financial results in the quarter were helped by structural factors that we can expect will continue like portfolio expansion, et cetera, versus maybe, I don't know, some more temporal factors such as presumably stronger auction prices during the quarter. What is your outlook for GM Financial going forward and how should we expect this business to fare in an environment of higher interest rates? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Yeah, I think from a GM Financial perspective we have talked about roughly doubling the EBT from a couple of years ago to, I believe, we said 2019. That remains on track. A lot of it is the portfolio growth that you're talking about. We continue to increase the penetration within GMF as well as just grow the overall size of the balance sheet and you've seen those results come through. The other points worth highlighting are credit losses; they remain within range and so we're constructive there as well. And residual prices, as you're well aware, they remain constructive also. So I would say it's all of the above and we're, again, continuing to risk-manage this business and this is going to be a strong contributor to earnings as we move forward. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just lastly from me, can you provide some color on how investors should be thinking about the new heavy duty pickup trucks due out next year and the profit potential they might provide. And I'm not even thinking here about the CK2500s, for example, in Flint North but the even bigger trucks I think are going to be built in a plant in Ohio with Navistar. Could this be a very meaningful profit contributor for you? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I think it's an important truck that we have and one of the things that is important is for some of those buyers having the full suite we think will also increase our heavy duties as you mentioned that we'll be launching next year from a Flint perspective. So it's the adjacencies that I think are going to drive the overall business up. So that's the way we look at it. I don't have specific figures to give you. But, we'll have that opportunity but what it drives in heavy duty is more significant. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on a great quarter. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Thank you. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Looking through the model, can you explain some of the weakness that is expected in Q4? Because I think you mentioned North America is fairly stable. I guess Cruise gets a bit worse. Maybe Other gets a bit worse. But what is the big driver that's sort of implied even at the high end of guidance, seems like there's a core deterioration quarter-over-quarter. Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: So, I would say, Colin, a few things. One, we expect in Q4 all the core operating segments to continue to be strong. I already talked about North America where we're going to continue to see tailwinds from T1 as well as the crew-cab mix that I alluded to. So North America will continue to remain strong. I did mention the launch cost related factors that we're factoring in to China but again the $2 billion equity income is reiterated. In South America, the FX continues to be the question mark over there. We've seen some tailwind after the elections but we're going to have to see what happens in Q4 from an FX perspective. GMF tends to be, from a Q4 perspective, the seasonal low point. But again, you've seen \u2013 to the prior question as well \u2013 significant profit growth year-over-year in GMF. So if you take a step back, the core operating items remain intact. What we really want to be mindful of is non-operating items such as PSA warrants for example, we saw tailwinds during this quarter and that's really going to be driven by what the stock price does there. And that's a non-operating item. And FX-type macro items that we want to be mindful of. But, we will see continued strength in Q4 from the operating side. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And I noticed in the walk, you mentioned crossovers as negative mix. In the past, that used to be cars. Is that \u2013 there's a lot of concern about SUV profitability. Are crossovers getting less profitable or is it just the mix now of cars is so small that crossovers versus pickups is the bigger drag? Dhivya Suryadevara - General Motors Co.: I think it really depends on which segment within crossovers. I think if you look at small and the compact segments, you're probably well aware, Colin, there's a lot more competition there and there's pricing pressure there. The mid-SUVs continue to perform really well, so it's really segment by segment within crossovers. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And, lastly, there's a recent article on Cruise highlighting people saying there's technology challenges there. Any comment on that media report? And is the 2019 launch in San Francisco still on track? Or is that at risk of being delayed? Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, we haven't explicitly said where that launch is going to be, but we are doing our testing in San Francisco. But, look, we continue to iterate rapidly. When you step back and look at this, this is really \u2013 I think what is happening is people are realizing this is really hard. And so, when we take the work and the expertise that we continue to grow at Cruise along with the auto expertise and combine that, we're working hard to solve that challenge. I mentioned before we have a well-defined plan on how we'll look at safety and we'll be gated by that. And really launching in one city is just the first step in what will be a multiyear, probably over decades, transformation of how people move from point A to point B. So, I think we need to keep that in perspective. There was also comments made about miles and I want to remind everybody that a mile is not a mile when you're doing AV testing. Clearly, the most complex miles that we're gaining experience in in San Francisco are very valuable, and so we're being efficient in driving the miles that we need to drive, getting the maximum learning as we move forward. So, I think that's the way we're looking at the business and I think it's a balanced view. But as I said, with the rate of iteration we're doing, we still believe and are continuing to target 2019 deployment. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Teresa Barra - General Motors Co.: Well, I want to once again thank everybody for participating on the call. And to sum up the quarter, I'd like to point to the fact that our strong results demonstrate our commitment to execute our plans amid industry headwinds. We continue to adapt and take actions necessary to create shareholder value through our strong and growing franchises, as well as our leadership position in the future of mobility. The management team is resolved to take actions to strengthen the business and we have driven downturn protection and disciplined capital allocation into the business and we also have an intense focus on generating cash. As we continue to operate in a dynamic business environment, we are fully focused on increasing our speed of execution as we transform GM and the future of the industry. So, thanks again for joining today. I appreciate all your questions and interest. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, February 6, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Dorothy. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2018. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's EVP and CFO; and a number of other executives. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rocky, and good morning everyone and thanks for joining. We delivered very strong results in 2018 despite significant macro headwinds and a year in which we transition to our light-duty pickup truck. Our North American performance was very strong as we launched pickup trucks and crossovers. China results were strong despite the market environment and GMF delivered record result. Let's get the full year 2018 numbers. Net revenue was 147 billion, EBIT adjusted was 11.8 billion, EBIT adjusted margins was 8%, our EPS diluted adjusted was $6.54. Our automotive adjusted free cash flow was 4.4 billion and this excludes the 600 million intention and prefunding payments and ROIC adjusted was 24.9% on a trailing four quarter basis. As we shared in January, we expect to improve 2019 earnings and cash flow as we move into the next phase of our transformation, linear, more agile and better position to win. Our favorable outlook is based on a continued robust mix of new products around the globe continue cost efficiency and our business transformation initiatives. We believe that we will continue to be macro uncertainty but we expect to mange through them based on current market conditions. Let\u2019s look at our performance in North America where we achieved a strong year including record fourth quarter earnings. In the U.S., we lead the industry and pickup sales for the fifth straight year and delivered more than a million crossovers. We will benefit from a full year of sales of our all new light-duty pickup and the cadence will continue with all new heavy-duty models. We've revealed the Chevrolet Silverado heavy-duty yesterday in Flint and it will go on sales later this year along with the GMC Sierra heavy-duty. We\u2019re encouraged by the early success of the newly launched Cadillac XT4 SUV which already leads in it segment and we will also see a full year of sales of the new Chevrolet Blazer. I would like to take a minute to update you on the business transformation actions we announced in November. We said, we would outline our product portfolio in capacity in North America with changing consumer preferences and transform the workforce to position the Company for long-term success. To-date, nearly 950 U.S. hourly employees have been placed in U.S. plants with products in key growth segment. At GM Canada, we are supporting affected employees by working with local colleges on retraining as well as with dealers and more than 20 local employers who have expressed interest in hiring these experienced employees, and we will also provide outplacement services to be impacted salaried employees. Business of the strong business results we delivered last year, eligible hourly employee will share in this success through profit sharing payments later this month. Moving to our international operations, the actions we announced earlier last year have placed GM Korea on a path to enterprise level profitability. However despite improved share in Brazil, the South America business remains a concern because of continued macroeconomic pressures. We are having productive discussions with key stakeholders to generate acceptable returns in the market. In China, we earned 2 billion in equity income last year and an increasingly challenging business environment. While we expect macro issues and flat industry performance will impact our results this year, we remain confident in the long-term position in China. We expect China industry sales to be roughly in line with 2018 levels based on expected GDP growth and our current assessment of market condition. Last week, the government announced actions to stimulate the economy and the industry and we look forward learning more about the details on these initiatives; however, generally such report had a positive impact on the auto sector. Our aggressive product cadence continue this year in China with more than 20 new and refresh models from our Buick, Chevrolet, Cadillac, Baojun and Wuling brands. This includes 7 SUVs and first of our all new global family of vehicles. I also want to mention the momentum at Cadillac. Last month, we announce that it will be GM's lead electric brand where we introduced our next generation EV technology. Through technology innovation and beautiful design, we\u2019re fully committed to restoring Cadillac to the luxury leader it should be. Last year, Cadillac posted another record year of global sales and we expect continued growth as we introduced a new model roughly every six months through 2021, including the XT6 SUV we unveiled last month. Turning to our future mobility initiatives, we made real progress last year toward expanding our leadership in both autonomous and electric vehicles since first announcing our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion nearly 18 months ago. GM Cruise is deeply resourced to succeed with more than 1,100 employees and 5 billion raise in external capital from Softbank and Honda in 2018. We have demonstrated our willingness to work with partners with common value and where a partnership can improve efficiency, capital spend and speed of development. For example, our AV collaboration with Honda builds on our existing EV battery and fuel cell work. On the EV front to encourage greater consumer acceptance of battery electric vehicles, last month, we announced the collaboration with three partners to establish the largest collective EV charging network in the United States. In addition, Cruise continues to focus on the entirety of the autonomous vehicle ecosystem citing the partnership with DoorDash last month. So to recap, we had another year of strong earnings and volatile environment. We offset macro headwinds with fresh product in the right segments by staying intensely focused on cost and by making the business decision throughout the year. So now I will turn the call over to Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thanks, Mary, and good morning everybody. We exceeded our expected 2018 results from both an EPS and adjusted automotive free cash flow perspective. Our performance was driven by strong execution across all of our operating segments including record fourth quarter results in North America and GM Financial. We were able to accelerate the execution of our transformation cost savings and started to see early benefits of these actions in the fourth quarter. With that, let\u2019s review the results in more detail. As Mary mentioned, we generated calendar year results of 147 billion in net revenue, 11.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 8% margins, 6.54 in EPS diluted adjusted and 4.4 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow excluding the impact of pension contribution. In the fourth quarter, we generated 38.4 billion in net revenue, 2.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 7.4% EBIT adjusted margin, $1.43 in EPS diluted adjusted and 4.2 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. Let's turn to North America. In the calendar year, North America generated 9.5% EBIT adjusted margin despite over a 1 billion of commodity headwinds and downtime taken for full site changeover. In Q4, North America delivered record EBIT adjusted results of 3.0 billion and 10.2% margin, up 20 basis points year-over-year. Performance of our all new light-duty pickup and strong material cost performance in the quarter more than offset commodity headwinds and the volume impact from downtime. The full-size pickup truck launch has been very strong. We have experienced a smooth ramp up of the new models as well as sell down of the old model. This reduced over 75,000 all new trucks in Q4 consisting primarily of highly profitability crew cab. This contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter. Let\u2019s move to GM International. Full year EBIT adjusted in GMI was down 900 million year-over-year primarily driven by FX headwinds in South America. For the fourth quarter, EBIT adjusted in GMI was down 500 million year-over-year due to South America headwinds as well as lower equity income in China. We still delivered strong full year equity income of 2 billion in China driven by our market position, cost performance and a richer mix of Cadillac. Equity income for the quarter was 300 million down year-over-year as a result of the industry slowdown, continued pricing pressure, and partially offset by cost efficiencies and Cadillac growth. Important to note that there were some factors specific to Q4 including lower production levels and elevated launch cost that impacted the results for the quarter by $100 million. A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segments. GM Financial posted all-time record revenue of 14 billion for the year and all-time record EBT adjusted of 1.9 billion. In the fourth quarter, GM Financial generated revenue of 3.6 billion and EBT adjusted of 400 million both records for the fourth quarter. In October, GM Financial paid a dividend of 375 million. As I mentioned last month, continued dividends from GM Financial provides an opportunity to strengthen our long-term cash generation capability and narrow the gap between earnings and free cash flow. Cruise costs were 700 million for the year and 200 million for Q4. We expect to spend approximately 1 billion in the GM Cruise segment in 2019. Corp segment costs for the full year were 600 million including approximately 250 million combined favorable impact from PSA warrants and revaluation of our list investment. We expect to spend the Corp segment to be about a billion in 2019. In the fourth quarter, Corp sector costs were impacted by unfavorable performance in PSA warrants and were $400 million negative for quarter. Before I close, I wanted to reiterate our outlook for the calendar year. As I mentioned last month, we expect strong EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $6.50 to $7 and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 to $6 billion. Catching on the headwinds, we will take downtime to the tune of 25,000 units as we prepare for the launch of our all new full-size SUV. We expect China equity income to be down moderately year-over-year. We expect to see headwinds year-over-year from commodities and tariffs to the tune of $1 billion. Finally headwinds from depreciation and pension income are expected to be approximately 1 billion, and as a reminder, since these are non-cash items, they were compressed the gap between earnings and free cash flow. Offsetting these are a number of tailwinds specific to GM. The full year benefit of our truck launch will provide tailwinds in volume, mix and price in 2019. We expect a meaningful benefit from full year of XT4 and Blazer, the launch of Cadillac XT6 as Mary mentioned, and the rollout of our global family of vehicles. We also expect year-over-year growth in high margin adjacencies like aftersales and OnStar. When you layer on top of that, the transformational cost savings of 2 billion to 2.5 billion through 2019, we expect these tailwinds to more than offset the headwinds, assuming a similar macro-environment. It is also important to understand this year quarterly cadence, we expect the first quarter to be the weakest since most of our SUV downtime will be taken in the first quarter. In addition, we will have lower volumes in China, given continued industry pressure while staying disciplined by reducing our inventory levels. As we progress through the year, we expect to see improvements in China equity income following these inventory actions and with a strong product launch cadence later in the year. As a reminder Q1 is typically our weakest cash flow quarter due to working capital seasonality. In addition, this year given the SUV downtime that I just mentioned, Q1 cash flow is expected to be meaningfully below our historical averages. For the full year, however, we expect cash flow to improve after Q1 and our full year free cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, will be in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. In summary, we had a solid finish to 2018 and we will continue to stay focused on execution in 2019, and as I mentioned in January, we had three key financial priorities including improving our free cash flow and cash conversion, a best-in-class cost structure and efficient capital deployment. That concludes our opening comments and we will now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : A sort of follow-up question to your finish there, Dhivya. I am just curious, if you could go through the cadence of the truck launches, I mean it sounds like you've got 75,000 to light duties in the fourth quarter, but obviously that\u2019s much lower than run rate you expect on a new truck. When the HD will actually start really contributing post there ramp and there launch and then when the SUV will layer in? So if you kind think about when those -- the SOPs for those and when the real full throated benefit comes for reach of the three tranches of the trucks? Dhivya Suryadevara : Sure, John. So, if you look at Fort Wayne, we\u2019re already up and running in full volume and that transition is over. So, if you switch over to Silao, which is where we have taken our downtime in fourth quarter, we\u2019re now up to full line rate reproduction for our light-duty pickup. As after January, we\u2019re up to full level of production. So light duties, we\u2019re pretty much with our transition. If you switch over to heavy-duty, most of the changeover we have been working on in 2018 and through second quarter of 2019, we will see transition. And after that starting in Q3 of 2019 is when you will see, the full production ramping up for heavy-duty. For SUVs, we\u2019re going to take the 25,000 downtime for the year that will be mostly in Q1 of 2019 and the SORP for that will be in 2020 and will have more to talk about that later. John Murphy : Just a second question, if you could update us on what\u2019s going on with Cruise? I mean, obviously, there was some talk about getting launched with a fleet, commercial fleet this year, something that might get a little bit delayed. And also maybe Mary, if you could talk about what\u2019s going on to DOT petition on the fourth gen Cruise? And if there's any word on that whatsoever? Mary Barra : So, there is really no word on the petition for our level four, our track four vehicle, but we also are very capable of launching with the truck three model. So, I think we\u2019re in good position there. We -- as we've been consistently communicating, safety is going to be the getting metrics for Cruise. We have hired -- we're at 1,100 people, so we've got the right team and at right focus obviously moving out there has been I think just shows our commitment to what we\u2019re doing there and been able to work on the whole ecosystem as well as the technology. We continue to make rapid progress with the technology, I think that's as evidenced by the video, we released just last month that shows that our vehicle can handle the new that others are struggling with. So I think we\u2019re in a very strong position, if not a leading position. So, we\u2019re continuing to make the rapid progress. We\u2019re going to make sure we meet all the appropriate safety thresholds that we defined for ourselves as well as the regulatory requirements, and this is going to be a really important critical year, and we\u2019re going to continue to update you as we progress, but I would say everything is moving forward in a very positive fashion. John Murphy : And then just lastly just one sort of housekeeping, when we think about the GMF dividends, I think it was 434 in '18. So what is the progression as the balance sheet and the earnings growth at GMF? And how should we think about sort of the addition of cash flow in 19 and 20 and beyond? Dhivya Suryadevara : So, John, you're absolutely right. The dividend in GMF is now at a level which is lower than what would be our steady state potential. If you look at our long-term earnings before tax expectation for GMF that's in the range of about $2 billion, and we expect that once we reach full captive and that's going to be likely in the early 2020, we would be able to dividend the earnings before that will after taxes, net income I would say about to be apparent. The curve between there and now would be determined by our average ratio along the way. And we have our managerial target of 10 times to leverage ratio of GMF. And if we've seen potential for the dividends, we will take that but we will ultimately be governed by maintaining and appropriate leverage ratio and our communications to the rating agencies and how much of dividends we take out of fin-co where we will assume in our outlook for 2019 is that a level that's comparable to 2018 from a dividend perspective. And if we see anything above that, that would be upside. But we will post you that from that as we move forward with how the leverage ratio developed. John Murphy : But simply, it's fair to say 1.5 billion potential upside run rate to free cash flow as GMF normalizes into its size that you want to get it to? Mary Barra : Thanks John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Couple of questions. One is this fourth quarter margin in North America obviously was really strong, it was up year-over-year despite the higher DNA, the commodity inflation, all of those headwinds and obviously you are so kind of early in the truck launch. I was hoping you may be able to just address one aspect of how we should be thinking about the truck positive from where we are right now into 2019? At one point, you talked about, I think it was a $2 billion revenue opportunity for you, as you convert your average transaction prices between where you were on the old trucks and were you expected to be. What your updated view on that? Are you tracking towards that? Is that something we should see in 2019? Dhivya Suryadevara : Sure. So, before we even get into the numbers, I would say from a truck launch perspective, we're really excited about the new generation of trucks and where we have been in the leadership position that for many years, and we expect to continue with that with this brand new launches that we have. And within that, Rod we -- if you remember, we had talked about the releasing a number of constraints that we have historically had with our previous truck platforms including crew cab capacity, which we have fixed that I would say with the current generation versus the prior generation. And also a wider and broader offering of vehicles including high-content, high-value, we would really participate in the middle of the curve and now we've sort of expanded that to the edges as well. So put all that together, Q4 you are starting to see, you already started to see the impact of pricing as well as mix in our new trucks. And what you're going to see in 2019 is, you could easily run rate that off of Q4 and we're also not going to have the volume headwinds that we saw in 2018 for light duties as we were transitioning them. So light duties, I would say volume up, mix favorable and pricing continues to be support of this world. Heavy duties, even you see this similar dynamic in the second half of the year, so you will see half year of benefit of that and SUVs as it continues to be a transition year. So, a simple way of looking at it for you would be to take the Q4 results for light duties and run rate that in 2019. Rod Lache : I was also hoping that you can address the non-China part of GMI? Looks like, it was about a $1.6 billion drag last year. What are your high-level expectations for this going forward? Obviously, there is some Korea improvement and is the rest of it contingent on macro in South America? Or are there some other things that you would expect to be big drivers? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, if you look at our South American business, over the last several, we've taken a number of actions to right size the cost structure and set the business up for future profitability. And in fact in Q4 of 2017, the business did breakeven and turned a profit. What happened in 2018 was, as you will know, the FX story there with the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso. What we've done since then is to start working with a number of our stakeholders, as you know in South America, and we will have more to say as we make more progress there. But it is important to know a couple of factors specific to 2019. One is, we are going to have a full-year impact of pricing in South America because priced tends to lag FX there. So last year as we were experiencing headwinds in FX, we were pricing for them but on a lagged basis. So you are going to see a full-year impact of that in 2019. And the second aspect is, towards the end of the year, we're going to start to see the impact of our global family of vehicles, and this is the portfolio that we shared more in detail about in last month of our Capital Markets Day. That portfolio is a new architecture that replaces the numbers of legacy architecture. So, the cost profile and the margin profile of the portfolio is different as well as the footprints to the portfolio where we have more hedged from an FX perspective. So, you're going to start to see the impact of that. So, year-over-year in 2019 based on everything in South America and those actions we've taken in Korea as well, we expect to see improvement from a profitably perspective with GMI. Rod Lache : And just my last question. You've talked about 4.5 billion to 6 billion of free cash flow, but 6 billion to 6.5 billion excluding the timing differences, which were I think largely related to the supplier payment days. If we were to think about the underlying free cash flow of the business in 2019, to kind of users as you for bridging purposes to understand where your free cash flow generative power is of the Company. Is it really closer to the 6 billion and the 6.5 billion just on a go forward basis? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I think timing you have addressed, Rod. It was basically related to supplier payments as well as production timing and our changeover. And as we look at -- look beyond 2019, excluding the impact of timing, you are going to see the remaining cost savings flow through, we said 4.5 billion in total. 2019 will get a about a half of it and the 2020 results will have the remaining benefits of the cost savings as well. And couple of that with our CapEx savings, we talked about how our 8.5 billion run rate will get to a -- 8.5 billion current level will get to a 7 billion by 2020. You're going to see the impact of that in 2020 as well. But obviously, if all of that is in the context of this current macro-environment and I'm -- what I am giving you is puts and takes assuming and nothing else changes, but you have tailwinds working for us in 2020. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli : Just a first question on China, given the recent challenges in the last few quarters, how you're now thinking about normalized China margins for GM say over the next couple of years? Mary Barra : I think if you look at, there is kind of puts and takes there from a Cadillac perspective and launching more cross over, we think there is an opportunity continue to grow and improve their margins. Clearly, as we transitioned to more electrified vehicles as we gain scale that will be lower and then we move higher. So, we're still focused on having strong margins and China will go through a bit of transition with the EVs. So, we think that specifically the growth of Cadillac and some of our larger SUVs will help to offset that. Itay Michaeli : And then, I think you've mentioned a $1 billion still assumed on for commodities and tariffs. Love to get your thoughts on tariffs component in terms of what you're assuming and just some of that the scenarios that we should be thinking about Section 232 and some of the other items are still outstanding out there? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, Itay, it's a pretty volatile environment, so I don\u2019t want to put specific numbers on individual components here. You've seen some pullback in steel and aluminum. Palladium has gone up and it changes day-to-day. So I wouldn\u2019t really break that down into individual components. We do have the 301 tariffs factored into our outlook for the year that's embedded in our 1 billion number. And as we said last year, the amount -- since our sourcing for steel and aluminum is largely local, we don\u2019t anticipate any tariff components there that's more of where the spot prices are moving and that tends to be lagged by a couple of months. So take that as a broader $1 billion number and we've shown during 2018 that we're going to work to offset that with matured cost efficiencies and other efficiency, so we can find and that's a no different in 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Just one quick question and I think Rod alluded to this. The higher D&A in North America, it looks like I think some of that was accelerated depreciation related to some of the actions you took in North America. Was that actually backed out then the accelerated part from the adjusted results? Dhivya Suryadevara : That's right. The accelerated depreciation as a part of the overall charge for transformation which is treated as special for EBIT adjusted. The one that Rod was talking about in the form of additional D&A, that is our normal cadence of our D&A normalizing to our capital level, and we saw a good portion of that flow through in the fixed component of our EBIT walk. For the fourth quarter as well as the calendar year, it impacted results. And as I said in 2019, that will continue to impact results as well. So, that's the normal D&A, Joe. The accelerated one is not counted in that. Joseph Spak : Okay. So of the 1 5 roughly in America, that includes the accelerated portion, so it was up -- so on an apples-to-apples basis, it was up a couple of $100 million year-over-year? Dhivya Suryadevara : You are talking about the accelerated portion or the normal\u2026 Joseph Spak : No. On an adjusted basis, how much higher was the D&A? Dhivya Suryadevara : I would say from the transformation perspective, we took a charge of about 1.3 billion for the year that included D&A of about 300 million or so with the 1.3 billion charge. So, that's the transformation portion. And on the normalized basis, if you look at our calendar year EBIT walk, the fixed component had a year-over-year increase a vast majority of that. If not all of it, I would say it would be attributed to D&A. Joseph Spak : The real point in going down this path is as we think. You showed the free cash flow walks on Slide 13, as we think about that CapEx less depreciation for '19. Does that gap further narrow relative to your $8 billion, $9 billion CapEx guidance for the year? Mary Barra : Yes, the way I would think about that bridges in 2019, you are going to have 1 billion of additional depreciation and pension income which are non-cash, so you will see the compression in the first two bar coming from that. And in 2020, you are going to see additional depreciation and pension and a decline in 1 billion of capital. So that should be on top of the pension and depreciation number that I would think about. And as John asked earlier about GMF, that's the other component of when that dividend starts to come in, that will be on top of this first two components. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan : There is obviously a lot of pushback on the plans to close some plans. I mean, how much of that 4.5 billion is at risk, if the unions don\u2019t allow those the concessions are closing? And do you see that as a risk? Mary Barra : I think obviously it's important, we announced that the plans are unallocated and as part of our UAW negotiations, this year we need to finalize the status. But I think when you look at the fact of the 2,800 workers that are impacted, 1,200 of retirement eligible, and we have about 2,700 jobs available, as I mentioned already 950 people have been placed. I think as we worked through and addressed the concerns from a workforce perspective, that will go a long way to allowing us to make this transition. And obviously, we have work to do, but when we look at what we need to do from a market perspective, we can't run at a 70% utilization, we had to improve that and that will work to accomplish. So, that's the way I look at, and I don\u2019t see risks from especially with the ability that we have to do with the people to places where we're hiring. And we just announced yesterday that we have 1,000 jobs available in Flint. So, I think it's the transition we have to go through, it's what we have to do and problem solve with UAW. Colin Langan : And when we look at your '19 guidance, what is the assumption on pickup? I mean, do expect to ends up more about the new product take pricing? Some of the recent data showed some market share shift, but it's followed months-to-months. I mean, are you optimistic that you're going to gain share with new truck? Or is it more about them? Dhivya Suryadevara : I would say as volume mix priced all of the above, we expect the truck penetration to hover around the ranges that it has booked in the recent past, which is in the low 20s. We expect that to continue going forward. The crew cab makes us an important component of all of this. As I mentioned earlier, in the second half of the year while we release the constraint on crew cab with Fort Wayne, we saw the tailwind associated with that and we are going to see in the full year, calendar year, a full impact of both Fort Wayne and Silao still out running at full crew cab capacity. Colin Langan : Got it. So with the recent market share changes that are showing up, that they are not -- until next year I guess, would be the short answer? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I wouldn't extrapolate from one data point Colin. Colin Langan : Got it. And just lastly, any color on where your inventory in China is -- a lot of concern that there is still high inventories, I guess, across the industry? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I would say we've taken actions in Q4 to right size our overall production levels. We took out about 250,000 units of production in China in Q4. If you look at the overall inventory picture, we target to be typically around 40 to 45 days of inventory. SGM, which operates more in the tier 1 to 2 cities, is a touch above that, and we're working on that further in Q1 of 2019. SGMW is at a level that is higher than we would like, and again that's action that we have to continue to take in Q1 as well. So when I talk about the cadence in my remarks, and I alluded to Q1 being the seasonal low in China as well, it factors the inventory right-sizing actions within that. Colin Langan : Got it. All right. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dhivya Suryadevara : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Great. Let's stay in China for the moment. Trying to read the tea leaves on your comments, as it sounds like your JV income should take a step down from the $300 million run rate in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, as you take some of these inventory actions and shutdown production in wholesales, but then you're expecting it to improve sequentially throughout the year, and outside -- getting to normalized wholesale shipments, I am just wondering what's the main driver there? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. Firstly, I would not assume that it would take a step down from Q4. I would say similar to Q4 we're taking inventory actions. We took them in Q4, from a production perspective and we're going to continue to take them in Q1 as well. And I think it's important to note, the 20 new launches that we talked about earlier, they are in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So actions that are specific to us, I would say, really starts to take effect in the latter half of the year. So from a cadence perspective in China I would say, Q1, expect similar-ish levels to Q4 and then pick up after that. But obviously with an eye overall on the macro environment as well as the sales picture over there. David Tamberrino : Got it. That's helpful, Dhivya. And then from a Cruise perspective, the spend, well below your billion target for the year. Is there anything to read into that? Are you signaling anything here? I kind of want to understand that if there was a tone-shift earlier, another analyst asked a question, it wasn't necessarily answered or not, if we should expect a later deployment in 2019. It seemed a little bit more squishy, if I can use that term. But on the back of that one tone-shift question; two, should that spend in 2019 ramp toward at $1 billion that you were looking for? And then what type of increased spend are you really contemplating at deployment for your operations, as well as customer acquisition costs with getting people into a AV ride-hailing network? Mary Barra : David, we're not squishy at all on our plan for AV for Cruise. I would say one of the reasons the spend is lower -- it turned out to be lower in 2018 is, Kyle Vogt is an excellent leader and manager and he spends every dollar like it's his own. So there's incredibly good cost controls in GM Cruise set out, and saw that we expect to spend this year. So I think that's just good cost discipline. As I said that -- this is one of the biggest technical challenges of our time. But I think we're really well positioned. We're committed. We have every resource we need, and if they come forward and say they need additional resources, we stand ready to provide those. So I think it's in a strong position from funding. I think it's in a strong position, as we continue to do the development. And yes, so we're going to keep you posted throughout the year. But we're on-track from the performance that we've talked about, and I think again, reference to video that -- what the vehicle is now able to do, we're going to continue to work on the regulatory front as well, and we will hold ourselves to the safety standards that we've set. But we're committed and we're moving at a very aggressive pace. David Tamberrino : Okay. And just within that, maybe I'm missing it, you did about $700 million of spend this year, your target was $1 billion for 2018, you came in $300 million low, I understand some cost saves. Are you expecting a similar level, $700 million in your 2019 guidance, just\u2026? Dhivya Suryadevara : Our guidance for 2019 for GM Cruise is approximately $1 billion. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Two quick questions. First, when do you think GM can sell EVs for a positive EBIT margin roughly? Mary Barra : So Adam, we've talked to you about the fact that with our next generation of development, that we want to make sure we have obtainable, profitable, desirable, and with the appropriate range. And so that is the work that we're doing. We benefit from the fact that we have a strong position in China, and as you know, the regulatory situation we will drive there. Also I think, important to note that we have the partnership with Honda to leverage the technology as well. So I think we're in a good position, driving our cell costs down, also from a quality perspective, and that is our stated goal when we launch that next family of vehicles. Adam Jonas : Okay. So I'm interpreting that as kind of post 2020, maybe 2021, correct me if I'm wrong. Second, question for either Mary, you or for Mark if he is on, what do you think of an all-electric pickup truck and when will GM sell an E-Silverado? Mary Barra : So, I think you said, correct, if you're wrong. I would say early next decade, but I wouldn't put any more specificity on EV profitability than that. And I'll say on your second question is, we believe in an all EV future. So you'll have to stay tuned. Adam Jonas : We will. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : I thought to ask on GM International restructuring progress outside of China that is. So can you provide us with an update on the Korea restructuring announced in the 1Q call last year, and how you would rate your progress there since that time? Also I think there were two international plants included in the restructuring announcement back in November. These were unnamed, but slated to close sometime in 2019, presumably they are outside Korea, perhaps South America. Any update you can provide on how investors should think about the cadence of those savings, as 2019 progresses? Mary Barra : I would step back and look more broadly at GMI, not including China and Dhivya has already addressed South America. I would say that Korea restructuring is on track, and we're also seeing a pickup in our share there. Obviously, there was a difficult period of time. So we continue to implement all of the actions that we announced last year. I would say there is still work that we're doing around that region to right size the business, have a solid plan to profitability and that work is under way. So I don't have anything more specific to add. But we're -- what we announced with the two plants is definitely on track. And I don't know, Dhivya, if you have any additional color you want to add there? Dhivya Suryadevara : I would just say that the cost savings that we have outlined for 2019, contemplate the right cadence for these plants as well. So it's all baked in. Ryan Brinkman : And then lastly, but sticking with GMI. It looks like currency continues to be a fairly large headwind, $300 million in the quarter. Seemingly the Argentine peso and the real, biggest drivers there. Based on the prevailing spot prices, any hedges that you might have? And then your localization plans with regard to the GEM platform, how should we think about this trend as 2019 progresses? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I would say there has been some stabilization post the elections in Brazil from a Brazilian real perspective. But obviously remains elevated relative to historical averages. I think the way to think about Brazil and Argentina is, we're able to price in line with inflation in Brazil, and we typically pass through the FX headwinds in Argentina. There might be a lag, Ryan, but I wouldn't think of Argentina as anything other than -- you take last few months of FX headwinds and kind of factor that into your future pricing ability. So, I wouldn't think of it as hedges and we don't use forwards necessarily in these areas. I would look at pricing and localization as the 2 primary levers we have from an FX management perspective. And on localization, the next generation of vehicles that I mentioned earlier, will be more localized. But with all the actions we're taking, it is our objective to be able to breakeven and turn a profit at even more extreme levels of FX. So we're continuing to work on it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. I want to ask a few questions around GM Financial. First, if I look at full year 2018 over 2017, ROA seemed to expand from 140 bps to 195 bps. Could you maybe dimension how much of that was due to lease residual performance versus credit performance versus other factors like net interest margin or cost saves? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I would say, if you look at overall year-over-year GMF EBT bridge, if you will, half it from increase in volumes as they continue to grow to full captive levels. So just their penetration getting higher and their overall volume is getting higher and the other half coming from the fact that, residual values were flat in 2018 versus 2017, so take the delta, Brian and divide that by two. Brian Johnson : Okay. So the main factor of the ROA increase would have been the residuals. Which gets to the second question, you've talked about a mature run rate of about $2 billion EBIT, full year 2019 was $1.9 billion and fourth quarter would kind of be right in line with that. Are you implying that it's sort of going to be flattish, as perhaps residual gains come down, given your used car pricing forecasts or even down next year? Dhivya Suryadevara : I'd say 2019 flat to 2018, we're expecting a 4% to 6% decline in residual values, which we expect will be offset by the growth in volume that I mentioned and our continued penetration. And the other aspect longer term as well, Brian, as the business matures, you're able to spread the OpEx over a larger asset base. So we should see OpEx efficiencies as well as we move forward. Brian Johnson : Okay. And the need to grow the asset base is why you're not committing to upping the payout ratio to the full 100% just yet? Dhivya Suryadevara : That's correct. So our current asset base is around -- north of $95 billion. We would see in the next several years, that that would tail off probably in the $120 million range. So the amount of equity that we are holding in the fin-co now is to support that remaining growth. Brian Johnson : And final question is around your GM Financial JV in China. At least the 3Q is up to 44% retail penetration, which seems impressive. A few, just more strategic questions; to what extent is there further room to use that to offset some of the headwinds in the Chinese market? And then second, as you kind of think about the mix -- vehicle mix in China, are you better able to penetrate the upper Cadillac, Buick and -- of the market with that support, versus the lower end, given the credit profile of the buyers? Dhivya Suryadevara : I'd say to you, first question, there's certainly room from a growth perspective for SAIC-GMAC joint venture. We are still in the early stages of, I would say, of penetration over there on financing and also the leasing portfolio which is in its infancy, so more growth to be had longer term. And across the board, I would say, in China, adjacencies are at its early stages of development across the board, whether it's the after sales, GMF and others. So, we will continue growing those. And from a vehicle mix perspective, perhaps more tilted toward the tier 1 to tier 2 market, than the tier 3 to tier 4 market. But I wouldn't specifically draw trends on Cadillac versus other brands. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Wanted to ask you about the expected cadence of some of the benefits from your restructuring actions, I assume that as part of your comments on the cadence for the earnings this year, some of it is also -- when some of these benefits hit and maybe beyond the first quarter. So can you maybe talk us about that $2 billion to $2.5 billion benefit expected for this year, how should we think about it in terms of progression throughout the year? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I'd say we're off to a pretty good start. As I mentioned in my comments, Q4, we already started to see early signs of these savings starting to flow through. And if you look at calendar year 2019, the savings will be tilted more toward the earlier part of the year. So we will be off to a pretty good start here after Q1. So I'd say Q1 is when we implemented, Q2 onwards, you will start to see the benefits. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, I understand. And I guess second question, there is -- I don't think there was a big focus on the Capital Markets Day. But I was curious about your thoughts around the opportunity to do some -- or the priority around doing some buybacks this year. It feels like if you achieve your $4.5 billion to $6 billion guidance, even after financing, restructuring and the common dividend, it feels like there could be some room, depending on where you shake out for some buyback. Is that a priority or is 2019 viewed as a more a transition year, and then it would come in future years? Mary Barra : Yes, we're going to stay very committed to our capital allocation framework of looking at opportunities to continue to invest in the business to generate a greater than 20% return, as well as maintaining an investment grade balance sheet. And then, as we get to that point, there is opportunity that will be returned to shareholders. So I don't have anything specific to say other than we're going to follow our process. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then I guess, finally, just curious what you're seeing in terms of latest data and trends in China. Obviously you're assuming a fairly flat market for the year, which I think when the guidance was given, may have been perhaps seen as optimistic. Now the most recent data point throughout January seemed to think there is going to be a little bit of stabilization. Are you seeing any of that or is it sort of like too early to say, in terms of the Chinese market? Mary Barra : No. I think we're seeing improvements from Q4. I mean it's early days, but we're optimistic, not only from what we've seen in the month of January, but also, what the government has announced, because we've seen that have a positive impact. And then again, the team there is very focused on costs and improving mix, etc. So with the new launches, we see a lot of, we see opportunity from an industry perspective, with the signs we saw in January and we also have a lot of, I'll say, GM specific opportunity. Emmanuel Rosner : And just very finally, I guess still on China. So how should we think about your guidance for a modest decline in equity income? I mean, it seems like you're speaking about Q1, not necessarily any worse than Q4, then I would assume beyond that, you sort of have the benefit from some of the new products and then potentially some stabilization in the market. So is it really thus -- mathematically you are lapping some very strong quarters last year, or is there anything else that's sort of like a headwind to expect throughout the year? Dhivya Suryadevara : I wouldn't say there's headwinds to expect beyond what we shared at Capital Markets Day. I think it's important to note that, when we say moderately lower equity income we're factoring all these in and it's our intent -- there will be puts and takes in different regions and between North America, China and so on. It's still our intent to post a strong calendar year, results from a company perspective. So I wouldn't over train on one versus the other. We do expect that as Mary mentioned, there's company specific factors that's going to help us. It is a volatile market at the end of the day, I wouldn't get any more specific on that. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : Hi. First time caller, as they say, so appreciate getting on the call. Maybe I can attack this cadence on the North American EBIT Just in a slightly different way. I think you guys been clear, that Q1 is low, we have production shutdown, and the cadence of the cost saves across the year. I think some of the questions investors may have are around in the second half. Is there any extraordinary cost that we should think about, given the launch of the heavy duty and the SUVs? Because if not, you would you would think that sort of cadence, beats the sort of Q4 as another peak. So is there any sort of offset to the benefit that you've laid out, that should get better across the year? Dhivya Suryadevara : I don't think there was any specific launch related costs or anything we haven't already talked about, that's going to weigh on North American results. We had talked about depreciation and pension income going down and commodity headwinds, that does impact North America, but that should even through the whole year, depending on how commodities behave in the next several quarters here. But I'd just say, beyond what you talked about on Q1 with the downtime and all the factors that I mentioned, that should positively impact the second half of the year. There is nothing that we haven't already discussed. Chris McNally : And just one follow-up on actually the timing of commodities and tariffs, I mean obviously, the $1 billion we are still annualizing some of the costs from last year, so it would make sense that those hits are greatest in the first half. It sort of surprised me a little bit, when you talked about some of the spot prices of the quarter of being a lag of quarters, I know sometimes with hedges, could be anywhere from, four to six quarters. Is it possible that if we see these spot levels continue over the first six months, that there actually could be some benefit by, let's call it the end of the year, as you know, obviously you've had to project out, for the full year? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. The lag that I talked about is in our index commodities. We typically experience a three month lag in -- when the actual impact shows up on our income statement versus when the spot prices go up or down. And I would say, it's really difficult to call the specific cadence of it. As you well know this moves up and down every quarter. I'd say evenly distributed through the entire year. We are obviously watching the 301 tariffs very closely, because that will have an impact, and within the current market environment, I'd say, you also need to look at the mix of which commodities are going up and down as well. So it's difficult to provide any more specificity on a topic that is inherently pretty volatile. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Thank you. Well, thanks everybody for participating today. As we begin the next phase of our transformation, I want you to know that we are committed to continuing to strengthen the core business, as well as continue to accelerate our work to lead in the future of personal mobility. We are really repositioning this company, what from -- one that was trying to be all things to all people in all markets, to a very strategic, agile and profitable company. And we believe we are in a very differentiated position than many of the competitors in this industry. We are intent on reinventing personal transportation, capitalizing on the $1 trillion opportunity on making the world safer, better and more sustainable. In 2019, we will continue to deliver on our commitments that we've made to you, our owners, by capitalizing on our strong global vehicle portfolio, our adjacent businesses, and we will stay focused on driving profitable growth across the business to create value in the short term and long term for our shareholders. This transformation will be very dynamic and -- but you have our commitment, that we will continue to act with speed, with discipline and with integrity, to drive the business performance that we need to win not only today, but in the future. So thanks again for your time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, April 30th, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks Dorothy. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2019. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and a number of other executives. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks Rocky and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining. Our Q1 results are as follows; net revenue of $34.9 billion; EBIT adjusted of $2.3 billion; EBIT adjusted margin of 6.6%; EPS diluted adjusted of $1.41; our automotive adjusted free cash flow was a negative $3.9 billion; and our return on invested capital adjusted was 23.8% on a trailing four-quarter basis. These results are in line with our outlook that we shared earlier this year. Q1 seasonality, full-size SUV production downtime, and reduced volumes in China impacted our results. We remain confident that our strong new vehicle launches and clean full-size trucks along with ongoing business transformation actions will help us deliver our full year commitment. Let's begin with our performance in North America. We generated the highest-ever first quarter average transaction prices on the strength of our trucks, SUVs, and crossover segments. Our Truck 1 strategy is focused on maximizing profitability by first introducing a richer mix of popular high-margin models like crew cabs followed by regular and double cabs. We are selling every truck we build. This strategy is also helping us grow share among higher priced trucks at the expense of our competitors. For example the GMC Sierra has gained four percentage points of share this year among models priced over $50,000. In addition year-over-year Q1 average transaction prices on our all-new light-duty crew cabs were nearly $5,800 higher than our outgoing model. Our truck launch continues to be well-positioned moving forward. We expect supplies of light-duty pickups will reach an optimal mix of cab styles and trims in the second quarter. In the second half of the year when industry truck sales are typically surging, we will introduce our 2020 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups. These are very popular with commercial customers and they contribute to adjacent sales of our light-duty pickups. As previously announced, to meet expected higher demand, we will increase heavy-duty capacity in Flint to build a higher mix of crew cab styles and trims that represent a strong profit growth opportunity. In addition we are on track for our upcoming full-size SUV launch with the planned downtime now behind us. We intend to build on our truck leadership. And with that in mind I want to address media coverage of the various industry partnerships around battery electric vehicles and trucks. As you know GM has an industry-leading truck franchise and industry-leading electrification capability. I assure you we will not feed our leadership on either front. We intend to create an all-electric future that includes a complete range of EVs including full-size pickups. And we will share additional information when competitively appropriate. Moving on to our crossover and SUV performance. We introduced the all-new Cadillac XT6 which goes on sale later this year. We are encouraged that two-thirds of the sales of the segment-leading Cadillac XT4 are to brand-new customers to the brand. And the Chevrolet Trax and Equinox set Q1 records. The GMC Acadia achieved its best quarter ever and the Buick Enclave sales are up 28% year-over-year. Dhivya will share more about our business transformation actions, but I want to update you on our progress toward offering relocation opportunities to employees at our unallocated plants. There are jobs available for all 2,800 impacted hourly employees and more than 1,300 have already accepted transfers to plants supporting growth segments like trucks, crossovers, and other high-demand vehicles. This includes our next-generation Corvette where just last week we announced we will add a second shift and 400 jobs at our Bowling Green, Kentucky facility. Moving to our international operations, In China, as we shared earlier in the year, we expected lower volumes and equity income in the quarter due to ongoing industry pressures. We stated in January, that we believed the industry would be roughly flat. And this -- there is uncertainty because of the stimulus discussion with nothing being finalized that we believe is creating more downside than upside risk in the near-term. We need to see the final details and how this will translate into demand for autos. But specific to General Motors we see tailwinds in the second half related to our vehicle launches. And we continue to believe we are well positioned for the long-term. Our strong brands and partnerships and our favorable mix of new vehicles continues to be a distinct advantage. The first sedan from our new global family of vehicles, the Chevrolet Onix, went on sale two weeks ago. It will be joined later by the Chevrolet Tracker and the Buick Encore, two new crossovers from this family. And we expect Cadillac's underlying strength in China to continue. Cadillac is updating its portfolio with a refreshed XT5 in May an all-new XT6 in July and the all-new CT5 sedan later this year. In South America, we have been working with stakeholders to generate appropriate returns in a challenging environment. Recently, we received meaningful concessions from all stakeholders that will enable us to invest nearly $2.7 billion over the next five years at two of our facilities in Brazil. Because we now see a viable path forward we will build future Chevrolet models at these facilities to strengthen our leading position in Brazil. These investments were contemplated in our overall capital plan. Turning to our future mobility initiatives, this quarter we announced that we will build a second battery-electric Chevrolet model along with the Bolt EV, at our Orion Assembly facility in Michigan, creating 400 new jobs when launched. On the self-driving vehicle front, GM Cruise while hire 1,000 employees this year, doubling its workforce as we work to safely deploy Cruise AV. So to recap the quarter, we delivered the results we expected given typical seasonality, full-size SUV downtime, and industry pressures in China. Before I turn it over to Dhivya, I do want to recognize Barry Engle, Gerald Johnson and Julian Blissett. They all began their new roles as a part of our senior leadership team this month. And they are proven leaders that will help continue our transformation and position the company for long-term success. Now let me turn it over Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thanks Mary and good morning everybody. We delivered solid results in the first quarter of 2019 in line with our expectations, as we face traditional Q1 seasonality, lower volumes in China and downtime as we prepare for the launch of our full-size SUVs. The strong performance of our all-new Silverado and Sierra pickup trucks, and favorable impact from transformation actions offset some of these headwinds. With that, let's review the results in more detail. As Mary mentioned we generated Q1 results of $34.9 billion in net revenue, $2.3 billion in EBIT adjusted, 6.6% margin, $1.41 in EPS-diluted adjusted and a negative $3.9 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. The $1.41 EPS-diluted adjusted includes a $0.31 benefit from Lyft and PSA revaluations. Excluding the impact of these items, the core automotive performance was solid and in line with our expectations. The Q1 cash burn of $3.9 billion reflects normal seasonality and is consistent with the cash flow outlook provided earlier this year. Let's turn to North America. North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $1.9 billion and 6.9% margins despite, downtime for full-size SUVs, lower pension income, increased depreciation and commodity headwinds. The performance of our all-new light-duty crew cabs, strong mature cost performance and savings from our transformation actions partially offset these headwinds. The launch of our light-duty Silverado and Sierra trucks has been exceptionally strong, and it contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter. As Mary mentioned our launch strategy is focused on maximizing profitability. With our transition from old to new architectures, we released the constraint on crew cab capacity, and filled the pipelines with these high-feature high-content trucks. We're seeing strong ATPs, from the new trucks and disciplined -- incentives remain disciplined. We're not growing our traditional cab and powertrain variants. We expect share in the lower-price segments of the markets to increase as at the mix normalizes. We see additional opportunity for upside from the heavy-duty later this year, as we launch our strongest most capable heavy-duty ever, featuring a powerful all-new Allison 10-speed automatic transmission with a Duramax diesel engine for class-leading towing capabilities. Our crossovers also performed well in the quarter, gaining market share and were a positive contributor to year-over-year profitability. Let's move to GM International. For the first quarter, EBIT-adjusted in GMI was down $200 million year-over-year, due to lower equity income in China, partially offset by the favorable impact of restructuring actions in Korea. China equity income for the quarter was $400 million, down $200 million year-over-year, as a result of lower industry volumes and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost efficiencies. The team in China continues to manage the business with an intense focus on cost and finding other opportunities such as growth in adjacencies to mitigate headwinds. We have been taking actions to right-size our inventories in China, by reducing production in Q1 by almost 20% year-over-year. We continue to work on reducing inventory through production actions, as well as retail sales increasing in the second half of the year with our 20 new launches in 2019. In South America, we continue to make progress on the turnaround of our business. We had a great franchise with leading market share and Brazil saw its best Q1 share since 2010. In working with the unions the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, suppliers and dealers in Brazil and in Argentina, we've negotiated a historic agreement that allows us to invest nearly $2.7 billion over the next five years, while reducing labor costs, indirect taxes and material costs. These negotiations coupled with continued pricing actions and the introduction of our global family of vehicles will help us move towards generating acceptable returns in this region, despite the macro volatility. A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial posted an all-time record quarterly revenue off $3.6 billion in the first quarter and EBT-adjusted of $400 million, as a result of portfolio growth offset by expected residual value pressures. Cruise costs were $200 million for the quarter and will ramp up through the year as we continue our hiring. We expect to spend approximately $1 billion in the Cruise segment in 2019, up year-over-year as we increase our headcount. Corp segment income in the first quarter was $200 million, including approximately $100 million favorable impact from PSA warrants and $300 million due to Lyft revaluation, after applying a liquidity haircut to reflect our six-month lock-up agreement. We continue to expect the underlying spend in the Corp segment to be about $1 billion in Q1 -- sorry, in 2019. Before I close, I wanted to reiterate our outlook for the calendar year. We continue to expect strong EPS-diluted adjusted in 2019 in the range of $6.50 to $7 and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. As I've mentioned before, we will face some headwinds, including moderately lower equity income in China, headwinds from commodities and tariffs to the tune of about $1 billion and depreciation and pension headwinds of approximately $1 billion. Offsetting these are a number of tailwinds, including the full year benefit of our truck launch, a meaningful benefit from Cadillac XT4, Cadillac XT6 and Chevrolet Blazer and the rollout of our global family of vehicles. We also continue to expect transformational cost savings of $2 billion to $2.5 billion through 2019. We have made significant progress to-date on the cost savings initiative. With the savings front-end loaded, we expect to achieve a significant portion of the 2019 savings starting in Q2. Our effective tax rate assumption for the year remains in the 16 to 18 percentage range. We expect to achieve our full year free cash flow outlook through strong EBIT performance, a partial rewind of working capital through the balance of the year, as well as dividends from China and GM Financial. This team is committed to improving quality of earnings and free cash flow conversion. Regarding the quarterly cadence in 2019, the first quarter is expected to be the weakest due to seasonality, full-size SUV downtime and lower volumes in China. In the second quarter, we will take three weeks of downtime in preparation for our heavy-duty pickup launch. By the full year, heavy-duty volumes are expected to be flat year-over-year as we took a similar amount of downtime last year in the third quarter. As we take additional inventory actions in China in Q2, we expect equity income to be sequentially weaker. As we cycle past the downtime in North America and actions to address inventory in China, we expect the second half of the year to be meaningfully stronger, both from an EBIT as well as free cash flow perspective. In summary, we had solid performance in Q1 and it sets us up well for strong performance for the rest of the year. That concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. A \u2013 Mary Barra : Good morning. Rod Lache : I just had a couple of questions. One is on China. On your Q4 call, you mentioned that Q1 would be similar to Q4 as you worked on inventory. It's obviously a little bit better. But now you're talking about that inventory correction continuing into Q2 and it's sequentially weaker. I was hoping you might be able to give us some parameters or brackets around how we should be expecting the year to look and what's the magnitude of these adjustments if you were not to be correcting inventory. What's sort of the underlying profitability of the business? A \u2013 Mary Barra : Well, Rod. This is Mary. I think you, I mean, what I mentioned it's really key that we get some stability from all of the stimulus measures. Because what's happening right now is you see a lot of volatility. There's something talked about. It doesn't get finalized. That's creating a lot of uncertainty for customers. So we're looking for that volatility to get resolved and for decisions to be made because we think that's holding back volume. There are some I'll say green shoots in China that we're observing. And then second part is -- what's GM-specific is we have a number of I think very important launches coming in the second part of the year. And some of them even started in Q2. So it's hard for General Motors to put a bracket around it when it's an industry issue around giving the consumer confidence of what to expect from a stimulus perspective. Dhivya Suryadevara : And if I could add a data point, Rod. In Q4 typically, we do have a higher level of launch costs. So you saw that in Q4 of 2018, we were impacted by about $100 million additional launch costs. So stripping that out in Q1 and we did take production actions of 20% year-over-year there is still as Mary mentioned work yet to do from an inventory rightsizing perspective. And we do see a path to making progress there in Q2 this year. And the rest of the year will be driven by launches as Mary mentioned. Rod Lache : Okay. Excluding the inventory correction I mean was there an inventory correction that occurred during Q1? So would the underlying profitability be better excluding that? Dhivya Suryadevara : We had flat inventory -- dealer inventory flattish at the end of Q4 of 2018 versus Q1 of 2019. And yes, there were actions that were taken to address it production actions so the 20% that I mentioned. And because of the volatility that we have seen in China there is yet more work to do beyond what we did in Q1. Rod Lache : Can you just switch to the pickup truck rollout? At one point you talked about a $2 billion revenue upside and some new platform, was wondering if that's still the case. There's obviously been a bit of volatility on your market share performance since you've been transitioning now with a pretty low inventory so far in the regular and double cabs. What's the status of that objective? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. So if you think back at the $2 billion there were a few points we made at that time. Firstly, the crew cab capacity in our K2 was constrained and we were running at below-industry averages from a crew cab perspective. And with the T1 architecture, we were able to release that constraint, so that we were able to increase our penetration from a crew cab standpoint by over 10 percentage points. So that was a huge driver as we talked about the revenue opportunity. We're very much in line from the additional revenue opportunity in crew cab mix. And frankly you're seeing that flow through in Q4 of 2018 and Q1 of 2019 as well as that's helped us offset some of the headwinds that we are seeing. In addition to that Rod, we do have capacity increases in T1 versus K2 that we had already built in. And from the light-duty standpoint we were able to increase capacity by a few couple of tens of thousands units and that drove tailwinds as well that was factored into the revenue opportunity of $2 billion. So between the crew cab mix and the additional capacity we are on track for the $2 billion revenue opportunity. Rod Lache : Great. And just one last quick one, you gave a range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion free cash flow. It's a pretty broad range. Whatever happens in China obviously wouldn't affect that this year since the dividends would come in next year from this. So how do you see that evolving? What are the factors that would drive upside or the high end or the low end of that forecast? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. I'd say two things. Obviously part of that is driven by the fact that we have an EPS range of $6.50 to $7. So there's the natural earnings range that comes with that. And in addition to that as you well know Rod it's a working capital-intensive business and we have $300 billion of commercial flows in and out happening every single year. And depending on production timing and of downtime actions that we're taking typically that tends to drive volatility in working capital. So I would say, its earnings-driven range plus the working capital seasonality that typically drives the cash flow range. Rod Lache : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good morning. Just can you tell us what \u2013 this was on slide 16 on the GMNA walk. This quarter I noticed that the material majors of the cost offset the majors for pricing. I think the last few quarters you were positive on that. Can you talk about the twin factors there and how you think about that relationship in the next few quarters? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. So the material on majors and the pricing on majors were typically on the light-duty truck front. And as you take a step back and look at overall K2 versus overall T1 profitability we are able to command a lot more price from a light-duty T1 perspective compared to K2s. Mary mentioned our crew cab ATPs for instance are higher significantly year-over-year. And obviously there's content that's added in the vehicle. But from a life-cycle-to-life-cycle average perspective Itay that's how I would think about it in sort of quarter-to-quarter noise. I would say that were comparable from an EBIT standpoint for these trucks on a like-for-like truck basis. Obviously, there's upside coming from the mix and the volume that I talked about. But I would say that, the data point in one quarter is generally not indicative. It will get better between Q2 and Q4. The way to think about it is a higher variable profit perhaps offset by some of D&A leading to flat EBIT between the two trucks on a truck-to-truck basis through the life cycle of the entire truck. Itay Michaeli : That's very helpful. Thanks, Dhivya. And then just second question just on Cruise AV. Just how was progress in the first quarter relative to your expectation in the previous timetable for Cruise to try to deploy it by the end of the year? Just love to get an update there. Mary Barra : Sure. First I think we have to step back. We are very pleased with our position and we look at this as the greatest engineering challenge of our lifetime. You look at the societal benefits that will happen when we unlock this not to mention the multitrillion-dollar market potential. I think our approach in the way that we are doing this from a fully integrated perspective and really the only one attacking this and doing it that way and then the continued improvement in our rate of iteration, when I look at it I wouldn't trade our position with anyone else. We have set aggressive goals for the team to motivate them to work in a \u2013 as fast as possible and I think we've made remarkable progress to date. So we expect to maintain the leadership position we're in now. And we will be gated by safety. Safety will be the priority. And that's how we're looking at this. Itay Michaeli : That's very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning, everybody. Just a first question on the outlook of $6.50 to $7 because I think there's some confusion in the market. And if we think about that range it excludes any revaluation from Lyft or the PSA warrants. Is that correct? Meaning on a year-over-year basis you would assume those as zero in that $6.50 to $7 range. Because I think there's some people that will think or looking at this as potential guide down with that $0.31 included. Is that correct? Dhivya Suryadevara : That is correct. There is 0 in terms of profits or revaluation tailwinds that we're assuming in our $6.50 to $7 outlook. That's core operating performance if you will. John Murphy : Got it. Okay. And then just a second question and I apologize to ask a simple cadence question. But if we look at the $1.10 operating EPS in the first quarter -- or if you normally seasonalize it, it would kind of get you in roughly $5 to $6 range, but if we think about the incremental product that's launching given that will create some upside. But specifically on the cost saves the $2.5 billion would be about $1.75 a year. If we think about three quarters of that that's $1.30 and that kind of gets us into the range quickly. I'm just trying to understand how much of the cost saves you think you'll realize of that $2.5 billion on a run rate basis in the second, third and fourth quarter, and if there was essentially nothing in the first quarter? Dhivya Suryadevara : Sure. So in the first quarter in our performance/timing line item in our bridge, we pointed out that there was $1 billion favorable. Within that I would say, John, roughly about $400 million worth of transformational cost savings that flowed through in Q1. To your point, we do anticipate those ramping up more in Q2, Q3 and Q4. So call it $400 million in Q1 and then getting to the run rate of $2.25 billion, $2 billion to $2.5 billion that I'd outlined in January. We remain on track for that. And since it's front-end loaded the run rate number is pretty close to what you'll end up achieving in the calendar year as well. But taking a step back on your question on earnings cadence, there's a number of factors that are driving H2 performance being stronger than H1 performance. Importantly, if you think about the downtime we already took 23,000 units for full-size SUVs in Q1. And the HD downtime that I talked about in Q2, that we're expecting you're going to see that reverse itself. Obviously, we're not going to have SUV downtime for the rest of the year. And once the heavy duty downtime is taken, we're still expecting flat number of units for the whole calendar year, which means H2 truck production will be higher than H1 truck production. And that's what's in our forecast. So that's an important factor as you think about cadence. When you put that together with the transformational cost actions that are ramping up more in Q2, Q3 and Q4 and the launches that I mentioned from an XT6 perspective as well as Blazer those are all acting as tailwinds. And that's -- Q1 was very much in plan. And the guidance of $6.50 to $7 bakes in this cadence that I talked about which is driven by very specific action items that we have laid out that gives us confidence in our ability to achieve that. Hopefully, that's helpful. John Murphy : That's very helpful. And then just two quick ones or one I think you meant, but I\u2019d be so quick. But the positioning in HD currently with the current capacity, I mean, I was just wondering if you could sort of dimension sort of where you think you are in positioning and what the capacity currently is and where that is going in the second half of the year. Just maybe in some kind of numbers whether it be the capacity numbers or ATPs that you think you might be able to achieve or the step-up in ATPs just so we can understand the change in the HD business. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. Between T1 and K2, we added some light-duty capacity and some heavy-duty capacity. Frankly, we're more constrained from an HD perspective than we were LDs. So we added about 40,000 units for HD and 20,000 units from an LD perspective. From -- this is comparing T1 to K2. Transaction prices obviously, typically, when -- this early in the launch you will see a lift in transaction prices and we do expect that. And from the perspective of the vehicle itself as we mentioned, we believe it's going to be exceptionally strong. And we think there's significant benefit from a transaction price perspective that will just come from the -- just the quality of the truck. John Murphy : And just really lastly quickly. GM Financial dividend what's your expectation for this year and where do you think that goes? Dhivya Suryadevara : The current expectation is flat GM Financial dividend year-over-year. You may recall we got $375 million last year baked into our outlook of flat expectations. We're going to have to see from a leverage standpoint and their earning assets and residual value how they pan out to see if there's any upside to that. But as of now our outlook is $375 million. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Rocky Gupta : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks everybody. First question is on trucks. Clearly, a very, very strong full-size and HD truck environment. I mean we're hearing from you and many of your competitors that demand has outstripped supply. I guess looking ahead do you think -- as you look on your own supply versus demand footprint and then your competitors, how much better can this get? It strikes many on this call that maybe this is peak truck. I don't know if you subscribe to that and whether you can kind of hold the peak truck or whether you genuinely think know there is significant room for this industry to go in terms of pushing the mix in ATPs further moving into 2020. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, Adam it's Dhivya. I will take a shot at that. You have heard us talk about how we believe that the truck market is quite different when you look at that versus the overall store. We have cited reasons like how the installed base is growing, the average age of the truck is growing at a faster pace than the average age of the overall light vehicle market. We do see a distinct data point in our use cases where customers are using it for commercial as well as personal purposes. And the fundamentals point to continuing strength from a truck perspective. The penetration are based at about 13% of the overall industry and you've seen that sort of flat over the last several years. And we are overall bullish because of the fundamentals that I mentioned from a truck standpoint. And within that, you've heard us talk about our own positioning as well and we're -- with the new launches we're very bullish on our T1 franchise. Adam Jonas : Okay. Sounds like not peak truck. The second question on cost savings. So, if we're in an environment where global production's plateauing, China isn't the gift that keeps on giving any more let's say just for the sake of discussion that truck mix can grind higher, but it's pretty awesome. So, maybe to get a real delta in profits you got to attack costs. And you've been very proactive at attacking structural costs the measures that you announced late last year. My question is isn't there -- can you share some examples and maybe some opportunity you have to attack content costs and your purchase bill of materials? It strikes me -- again talking to your competitors as well that electronics costs for example and electromechanical costs around internal combustion architectures that may at the margin be antiquated are just a huge burden. I mean you talk to some of the folks in Germany 40% of their costs are electronics. I'm not saying you're that high, but can you -- can that stop? Can you start to attack that through design and your new electric architecture to the point where you can get savings from your suppliers to pitch in instead of you doing all the hard work in the factories? So, taking all of the tweaks -- all the tweaks to arm. Thanks. Mary Barra : Yes. Adam I think it's a really important point. And it's something we're focused on in every single region around the globe be it some of the work that we did in the first quarter in South America where the suppliers came to the party and -- but also we're working with them to make sure that we actually take cost out drive efficiencies so those cost downs are permanent. It's a culture in China with their efficiency up cost down. And you'll see that is something that they are continuing to work on in material costs contenting. Complexity reductions are all pieces of that. We're also -- have very specific initiatives in the United States. Looking at how do we take out cost today and do that with our suppliers instead of to our suppliers driving efficiencies, I'm really encouraged by the fact if you look at -- General Motors has really over the last several years and with the work that Steve Kiefer and his team built a very strong relationship with our suppliers. And looking at innovation, getting them involved early in the design phase so we get their best ideas is something we are definitely driving as well as a very focused effort on complexity reduction and focus on what customers want because it's a constant battle. Because you want to give the customer exactly what they want but you want to do it in the most efficient way. So, those are initiatives that are running across the company. We have assigned projects vice presidents responsible for it and they report out on a regular basis. So, completely agree and we're attacking it with quite a bit of energy. Adam Jonas : I'm sure you will Mary. Thanks everybody. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Dhivya thanks for the color on the transformation savings in the quarter. I just want to be clear, is that -- that excludes some of the savings also that you -- the billing that you recognized in from Korea that's recognized in GMI? Dhivya Suryadevara : That's right. The $400 million that I'd referenced, which is embedded in our $1 billion does exclude the Korean restructuring. So the apples-to-apples, Joe that I would think about is of the $4.5 billion that we said we were going to achieve by the end of 2020. And the $2 billion to $2.5 billion that we have laid out for this year, the portion that we have achieved in Q1 is that $400 million. Joseph Spak : Okay. So then -- and then that's the -- and then if we just look at the GMNA results where it was I think that for you was $700 million. So basically that $400 million and that $700 million is the transformation savings and that ramps as you go through the year? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. There's a -- after $400 million GMNA ends up getting most of the savings. There's some that accrue to the other regions as well. And the other half of that I would say roughly is timing related. Obviously you're comparing one quarter and another quarter, and neither of which are run rate quarters. So there's some noise in there. Joseph Spak : Right. And sorry if I missed this, but any change to the commodity outlook for the year? Dhivya Suryadevara : We had said earlier this year that we would see $1 billion headwind from commodities and tariffs. There's a few items that are tailwinds, Joe as it relates to steel and aluminum backing up a little bit as well as delay in some of the T1 tariffs. There's also some headwinds from a palladium standpoint. And, obviously, we could see how the overall tariff environment plays out. We're still baking in the $1 billion. And as the environment changes, we will update you guys on that. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then just quickly back to China. If we just compare versus the fourth quarter wholesales were down like 25%, but the net income margin and JV income was up. And you mentioned some of the work and I think you also mentioned maybe some benefit from some of the adjacencies. But any more detail you could provide as to what really drove that income higher despite the big sequential decline? Mary Barra : Well, I'd say there's -- Q4 did have the launch cost that I mentioned of about $100 million. And we've taken actions to right size inventory, nothing specific to add. The adjacencies are helping as well as the cost actions that Mary mentioned. We are intensely focused on cost from a China standpoint and there's been an even more increased effort given the market environment that's happening in China. So other than that I would just say continuing to work on inventory and into Q2 and you'll see that impact in -- playing out in Q2 as well. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Yeah, great. Let's head back to North America and just talk about pickup trucks. Within that segment right now it's just -- tactically it seems like there's a lot of inventory from both yourselves and your two main competitors. And one of your competitors refreshed their product already in the first quarter. You guys were shared owners. You're refreshing your heavy-duty for the back half but they are as well. And then you'll have a third competitor with a mid-cycle refresh coming. Just trying to wrap our heads around where the market share return is going to come for GM and just how you're thinking about your -- competing with the net market that certainly seems to have a little bit more supply. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah Well, I'd just say from a share standpoint it's look we're still in the early innings from a launch perspective. And if you look at what we actually have already rolled out, its crew cabs. And as we go through the rest of Q2, we're going to see the work trucks coming in. We're going to see regular cabs, diesel as I pointed out as well as HD. And as Mary mentioned we're seeing share gains in the areas where we've already rolled out. Crew cabs are up 20% year-over-year. Sierra has taken four percentage points of share. And I think you got to see the mix normalized before you can get insight from the noise that you're seeing during the transition. David Tamberrino : Okay. So the point being that as you get through 2Q and maybe finish the quarter you'll have more normalized double cabs, regular cabs and then your HD launching, which is where you'll see the share gains in the back half? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. I think that's a fair assumption. And, obviously, early days yet in April but we are still feeling as we're rolling out the other variants tailwinds from a share perspective. Mary Barra : I mean we just overall, David we are seeing growth even in -- as we go into the start of the second quarter. So we're confident in the truck. And as Dhivya said when we get the full mix out there and are competing across all segments, we expect to have our rightful share. David Tamberrino : Understood. And then on the GMF perspective, the residual values, did those come in weaker than you expected? I think you had maybe down 4% of 5% assumed for the year. Is that still the case? Or you're seeing something a little worse a little better? Dhivya Suryadevara : Residual value for Q1 were down about 2% and we're still anticipating 4% to 5% decline in the residual values year-over-year. And if you actually look at the Q1 performance, it was in line with our expectations. You had some puts and takes. In Q1 of 2018, it's important to note we had some one-time items from a GMF standpoint. So, it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. And our -- if you look at our earning asset growth as well as our revenue growth in GMF, that's per plan. And against that you have the residual value pressures and the credit pressures that I talked about, as well as that -- you got to -- it's important to note our funding plan tends to be lumpy. We go out in the market, raise unsecured and then the asset growth catches up to that. We did fund early on in this year and we are ahead in our unsecured plan which is also causing some headwinds from an interest -- net interest margin perspective. So you roll all that together, we see a flat year-over-year 2018 versus 2019. And you will see this normalize in the other quarters. David Tamberrino : Okay. I got it. So even though the residual values will get worse -- or anticipated to get worse throughout the year you prefunded that interest cost headwind will be somewhat negated as you grow your balance sheet? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. David Tamberrino : Okay. And then lastly, I know you got asked about it earlier from a Cruise perspective. But is there any update on timing, update on thinking as to when we can expect maybe a little bit more of an unveil or further update? Because I don't think we've had one for maybe a year and a half now since that November Investor Day on Cruise. Mary Barra : Yeah. I think you'll see updates later this year. And just from an overall, again, we are very pleased and -- with where we're at from a continuing rate of progress. I think many underestimate how important it is to use the deep integration that we're doing. Let me remind everybody that we have changed 40% of the components in the vehicle understanding what it takes to have true safety systems in the vehicle when you don't have a driver along with the fact that we're doing our testing in one of the most complex environments in the United States. And so when you put that together that's what gives us confidence that we've got a very strong position. We also have a very strong safety record. I mean, I think if you look at -- one example is we have Super Cruise. And Super Cruise is a technology that is being recognized -- externally winning a lot of awards from customer feedback once they have it. They're disappointed if they don't, because it's such a great feature. And we look and we develop and we monitor to our safety standards and that's what we're going to do. If this we\u2019re able to launch without the driver we will. But I also want to remind everybody that's just the start. There is still much more to do to take costs down from all the technologies that is in the vehicle to advance the capability of the vehicle, so it can continue to be launched in other markets to create that multitrillion-dollar market potential. So safety will gate us. We see a huge opportunity. We think the path that we're on and the way in which we're developing this technology is critical. David Tamberrino : Okay. Appreciate all, Dhivya. Thank you, Mary. Look forward to the update. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Is there an update you can provide on the GM International restructuring front? When the transformation actions were announced in November, it was relayed seven plants would close. Five being in North America which were disclosed at that time, but two being I think unnamed international facilities. You've taken definitive action in Korea. China isn't the place we've really thought about you looking to reduce capacity. So should we think about South America as the next focus of your footprint actions? And how would you say you're progressing with regards to your restructuring actions in South America? And any updated thoughts on when consolidated IO might be able to reach breakeven? Mary Barra : So I don't have any more details to provide. I would tell you though, the plans from a GM International transformation are well underway. We just don't have anything to announce at that time but everything is still on track. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thanks. And then looking at slide 16 in the appendix, can you talk about some of the factors that roll up into performance/timing driver that was a $700 million tailwind? How should we think about the proportion of that cost tailwind that relates to structural factors like the transformation or maybe more transient timing-related factors? Dhivya Suryadevara : I would say about half and half. If you look at it, this was GM North America, right? From a company perspective, Ryan, we had $1 billion in performance and timing. I would say, roughly $200 million of that is commercial and technical savings that we typically achieve every year from a material cost standpoint. And -- so that, I think -- you can't think of that as transient, I would say, that's continuing. Of the remaining $800 million or so, from a company perspective, I'd say, half and half timing. Half timing and half transformational actions, benefit starting to flow through. The $700 million you're seeing in North America, you could take a bulk of what I just explained for the total company into the same dynamic, as rolling through the North America. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. And then, just lastly, there's been a lot of pickup truck launch questions already, but maybe from a different perspective. There was increased media and investor attention during the quarter, relative to your market share in full-size trucks, with some observing that -- emphasizing profitability over volume. It served GM North America profit very well so far. But just a question, if maybe the pricing has been perhaps too disciplined. Can you parse out some of the nuance of this launch in terms of how you're thinking about volume relative to price and if there's any sort of counterpoints you would make on the market share front relative to availability of trim levels, et cetera. Mary Barra : Yes. I think, as you look at it, we are in transition. We're in launch and the launch is going extremely well. As we said before, we've started with a richer mix and we're seeing the performance already in crew cabs. And so, I think, you can't look at the first quarter and think that that's the performance that's going to be for the year. As Dhivya mentioned, we'll round out the entire lineup. That will give us opportunities, as we go through the year, not to mention the opportunities in heavy-duty trucks, the opportunities in additional volumes. So we will be appropriately disciplined and respond to the market appropriately. But we think we've got a really, really strong truck. We're just in the middle of launching all phases of it. And we're on track to our plan and we -- but we do understand where we should be from a positioning from an overall market share perspective and we're focused on that as well. But we're going to do it in a disciplined fashion. And I think, the way we've launched this has been very well thought-through to maximize profits and make sure we have the representation that we should and be highly profitable end of the truck mix. Ryan Brinkman : That\u2019s it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays Capital. Brian Johnson : Hi. I have two questions; kind of a housekeeping one again on pickups for Dhivya, then a broader question for Mary. Back to the question of the 400 pricing versus 400 materials costs, is crew cab and the higher crew cab, do you put that in the mix waterfall or into the pricing waterfall? Dhivya Suryadevara : Well, it's really both. And to the extent that we have the mix -- the percentage mix of crew cabs being higher year-over-year, you will see a benefit in the mix bucket, Brian. The reason you're not seeing that this time is, it was offset by the full-size SUV downtime that we took as well, which is negative to mix. So mix is actually flat, but in reality it's a positive number that's being offset by the downtime dynamic that's happening. And the price aspect as well, to the extent that there's an increase in price, you'll see that in the price bucket. And you look at that in conjunction with the cost bucket to see what the material on majors was. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. And a question for Mary. I mean, we've talked over the years about the cultural change you did at GM and a greater focus on cost accountability, making sure you're in the right product and geographies to drive profit. But one thing I do hear from investors is, if they look at GM design, broadly speaking, both the vehicles, the interiors, the advertising it just doesn't, in some people's view, have the kind of pizzazz as you might see. I don't always like going back to Tesla, but it's not lost on some of us that one of your designer Elon's created their vehicle lineup. FILE the advertising it just doesn't, in some people's view, have the kind of pizzazz as you might see. I don't always like going back to Tesla, but it's not lost on some of us that one of your designer Elon's created their vehicle lineup. So just, how are you thinking about the state of design overall at GM? Is it an important differentiator? Or do you think it's more important to get capable vehicles out there and kind of play it more on the profit and the cost game? And if it is more important, what would you -- what are you trying to do to kind of move it to the next level? A \u2013 Mary Barra : I think it's incredibly important. You have to do everything to win in this market. And design is a very important piece of it. I think we have a very disciplined process where we clinic data and understand the customers in segment and what they're looking for, how they view products. Full-size truck is different than a Cadillac is different than a compact SUV like the Chevrolet Equinox. And so, we have a very rigorous process on how we develop trucks and really focus on putting the customer at the center as we do those designs. But all aspects are critically important. I think if you -- you mentioned advertising as well. I think Cadillac is a really good example as you've seen the shift that we've made. And Steve Carlisle can do a better job of telling you, but the list that we've had with Cruise, with the right campaign has been very, very successful. And I would also say, when you look at brand building, there's been tremendous improvement across all of our brands and strengthening from the key brand metrics. So we're focused on having beautifully designed products that people want and desire and got to have to having the right contenting, so we could have the right package and efficiency and affordability for the customer and winning the marketplace and then having advertising that breaks through. But sometimes the advertising that breaks through and is most effective with the customers isn't the one that wins all the awards. Q \u2013 Brian Johnson : And just back to the design process. I mean you talked about discipline and focus groups. But how do you create enough room for sort of off the wall creativity and things -- the classic apple things, people didn't know they wanted until they saw it? A \u2013 Mary Barra : Well, I think not on the design base, but on the technology base, Super Cruise is exactly that. And that's the feedback we're getting from customers. But as it relates to design, one of the interesting things Brian that we do is as we start a new product there's advanced design where almost any designer in the company can participate in putting ideas forward. And there's a process that we try to not -- even if there's a team responsible for a certain brand, certain product, but we allow every designer in the company to provide input. So that's the way we work there. I would say another great example of innovation coming from every member of the GM team is the MultiPro Tailgate. That's part of the GMC truck. And that came through the creativity and innovation from our workforce and in our manufacturing shops. So we have an innovation process where everybody can participate. I think I've talked about in the past; we also have our own version of what I'd call the Shark Tank with Synapse where we have organized competitions that people from all over the company not necessarily in their area of work, bring in creative ideas. And then chief engineers and designers are kind of the panel and their commitment when they approve an idea is to actually put it into production. So we're working hard to capitalize on the incredible talent and innovation of the entire General Motors team. I've given you a just a couple of examples of both how it can happen and then processes we've put in place to enable it and encourage us. Q \u2013 Brian Johnson : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Q \u2013 Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just the first, can we just recap the cadence guidance? I just want make sure all my facts are right. The second half will be stronger than the first half. Q1 is the weakest. So that means Q2 will be slightly better excluding the mark-to-market on Lyft and PSA. And I'm not sure did you give a number of the downtime of the heavy-duty? I know in Q1, it was about 25,000 SUVs. Is there a number for Q2 downtime? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. So for your first question from a cadence standpoint, Q1 is the weakest. Q2 will be better than Q1. But H2, both Q3 and Q4 is stronger than Q1 and Q2, primarily driven by downtime. As you saw, we took 23,000 units in Q1 for full-size SUVs. And as you think about the second quarter from a HD standpoint, we're probably going to have roughly 25,000 units down as well. But that will be offset by the fact that you have absence of downtime in full-size SUVs as well as absence of downtime in our light duties, which we did take a week of downtime in light duties in our Silao plant in Q1. So putting all of that together, I'd say Colin, Q1 weakest, Q2 better than that, and H2 driven by volumes that I talked about before as well as the cost transformation actions. Both the Q3, Q4 is stronger than Q1 and Q2. Colin Langan : Got it. And just two last quick ones. How should we think about restructuring cash impact? Will we see that later in the year? And also what is your current guidance for the market in China? If I understand I think originally you had said, it would be about flat. I mean is that still what you think? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. So from a cash perspective, we're anticipating roughly $2 billion of total cash spend, and a bulk of that will be incurred in 2019. There's about $1.5 billion left to be paid yet this year, and there's a tail going into 2020 as well. And from a China outlook standpoint, Mary addressed it. Obviously, lots of volatility given what's going on, and we're going to have to see how the stimulus and the other measures play out. Colin Langan : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Barra : Thanks, everybody. I really appreciate your participation this morning on the call. I want to close by reiterating our confidence in our full-year outlook of earnings per share of $6.50 to $7 and free cash flow between $4.5 billion and $6 billion. I think we have a track record of delivering on our commitments despite the industry macro challenges. And as Dhivya had said, this quarter was in line with our expectations. As we move forward, we're going to continue to seize every opportunity to manage what is in our control. In the United States that means we're going to focus on flawlessly launching the next Phase, the heavy-duty full-size trucks our crossovers and our Cadillac vehicles. We're going to work to realize the 2019 transformational cost savings that we outlined last November that are on track. And we're going to capitalize on the healthy economy in this country. Globally, we're launching an aggressive new vehicle lineup in China, and we've secured the necessary concessions to further strengthen our Chevrolet franchise in Brazil. So while, we've done much of the foundational work to right-size the business and our portfolio, we know this transformation is far from over. And we also understand what's at stake, and more importantly, the tremendous opportunity that is ahead of us. And I really believe we have the leadership team. We have the vision, the discipline, the technology and the commitment, and culture to create this win and to create value for our shareholders. And that's what we focus on doing every day. So thank you very much. I appreciate your attention. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Thursday August 1st, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks Stephanie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2019. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO, and a number of other Executives. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks Rocky and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining the call. We achieved solid results in our second quarter and the strength of our performance in North America. Overall, we delivered net revenue of $36.1 billion, EBIT adjusted of $3 billion, EBIT adjusted margin of 8.4%, EPS diluted adjusted of $1.64, automotive adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion, and a ROIC adjusted of 22.7% on a trailing four-quarter basis. Strong consumer demand for full-size trucks, crossovers, and SUVs, along with our business transformation actions drove the company's profitability. This helped offset the effects of planned heavy-duty downtime ahead of our launch and industry weakness in China. We expect our launch strength to continue in the second half of the year as our heavy-duty truck availability improves and as we launch new crossovers and entries from our new global family of vehicles. Looking at North America, our year-over-year results improved thanks in part to growing truck sales and share and second quarter records for average transaction prices and crossover deliveries. Later this quarter, we'll begin delivering the 2020 Silverado with an optional all-new Duramax turbodiesel engine that delivers best-in-class highway fuel economy of up to 33 miles per gallon. GM's clear leadership in the large SUV segment continued with deliveries of current generation models up 16% year-over-year with lower incentives than those of our competitors. We also performed well in our crossover segments contributing to profitability. We unveiled the highly anticipated mid-engine 2020 Corvette Stingray two weeks ago in California to a global audience of nearly 300,000. We plan to increase production of this iconic sports car and begin shipping the all-new models to dealers by the end of the year. Looking at Cadillac, the brand sold more than 111,000 vehicles worldwide during the quarter. The XT5 continues to be the brand's best-selling model globally. The new XT6 seven-passenger crossover is now on sale in North America and in China, further strengthening Cadillac's position in the high-growth luxury SUV segment. In the U.S., the XT6 is off to a strong start ahead of its official launch. Dealers and media have given us very good feedback. And the XT6 brings new interest to the brand. Cadillac is also expanding the functionality and range of its Super Cruise hands-free driver assistance technology in the U.S. and Canada. We are adding 70,000 miles of compatible divided highway. By year-end CT6 owners will be able to operate Super Cruise on 200,000 miles of highway. More than 85% of current CT6 owners said that for future vehicle consideration, they would prefer or only consider a vehicle equipped with Super Cruise. Dhivya will provide additional details on our business transformation actions shortly. But I would like to update you on the progress toward offering relocation opportunities to hourly employees at U.S. plants that have unallocated products. There is a job for every impacted employee. To-date about 1,700 of the 2,800 employees have accepted transfers to plants supporting growth segments and we are working actively to place more employees into open positions. As we look at our international operations, in China, the continued economic slowdown has resulted in a softer industry. GM China headwinds in the quarter include lower volumes, significant pricing pressure, regulatory changes, slower sales of our outgoing models, and shifting customer preferences. Even as we launch new vehicles in Q3 and Q4, we see many of these dynamics continuing. Therefore, we expect equity income in the second half of the year will be generally in line with the first half. In South America, we continue to work with our stakeholders to turn around the business and capitalize on Chevrolet's 18 years of sales leadership in the region. In addition to the actions we're taking to strengthen our core business, we are also making important strides toward our vision of an all-electric self-driving future. We recently revealed a new digital vehicle platform that will fully integrate our electric propulsion systems, cybersecurity protection, advanced Active Safety systems; and Super Cruise technology. This platform also enables more systems in the vehicle to receive over-the-air software updates including telematics, chassis controls, and more. This will deliver value and convenience to our customers. Following its debut on the Cadillac CT5 and the 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray it will expand to most of our global lineup by 2023. We are also working to drive greater customer acceptance of EVs by addressing their concerns about range and charging availability. In addition to earlier infrastructure announcements we've made we've partnered with Qmerit an online platform that links EV owners with GM-approved installers of home charging systems. Turning to Cruise. In May Cruise secured an equity investment of $1.1 billion from a group of institutional investors including funds and accounts by T. Rowe Price and existing partners SoftBank and Honda and a $700 million investment from General Motors. These additional investments now value Cruise at $19 billion. We have said from the beginning that the benefit of self-driving vehicles will only be realized by deploying safely and at massive scale. For the past four years, Cruise has been creating the necessary building blocks to do just that. It has expanded its workforce, raised billions in capital, achieved deep integration with General Motors and focused on testing and development in one of the most complex urban environments. They have recently took steps toward large-scale deployment of an all-electric EVs in San Francisco where driving conditions are 40 times more challenging than in the suburban setting. In the second half of this year, Cruise will significantly accelerate testing and safety validation of its fleet and increase the number of miles driven. Cruise will also increase its community engagement and continue to scale EV infrastructure build-out. In addition, hundreds of talented Cruise General Motors and Honda engineers are developing a next-generation purpose-built AV that leverages our leadership and hardware and software integration and related safety validation. It has become clear that to successfully deploy at scale we need to not only win the tech race but we need to build trust with consumers. And that is exactly what we intend to do. So to recap, we delivered a solid quarter as we begin to demonstrate the earnings power of our full-size truck business and our ongoing transformation. We are committed to our full year outlook that includes earnings per share of $6.50 to $7 and automotive free cash flow of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. Dhivya will now give you more details and then we'll take your questions. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thanks, Mary and good morning everybody. We generated Q2 results of $36.1 billion in net revenue, $3 billion EBIT adjusted, 8.4% margin, $1.64 in EPS diluted adjusted; and $2.5 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. The $1.64 EPS diluted adjusted includes a $0.01 loss from our Lyft and PSA revaluations. Let's go to North America. North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $3 billion in Q2 and 10.7% margin driven by our light-duty truck performance, crossover performance and the impact to our cost actions. This was partially offset by planned downtime for heavy-duty pickup trucks, lower pension income and increased depreciation. The light-duty truck performance contributed favorably to volume mix and price during the quarter. As Mary mentioned we're in the early stages of demonstrating the earnings power of our leading truck franchise and see additional opportunity for upside as we complete the launch of the heavy-duty trucks and looking into next year the launch of the full-size SUVs. The heavy-duty trucks will follow a similar cadence as the light-duty truck launch, focusing first on the crew cabs, followed by the double, and then the regular cab models. Retail sales of the new Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty crew cabs were up double digits for the second straight quarter as we continue to shift additional models to dealers. The retail market share of our light-duty pickup trucks improved nearly three percentage points from Q1 to 36.5%, the highest of the industry. We've done this with a very thoughtful launch strategy and a disciplined use of incentives with share growth concentrated in the over $50,000 average transaction price segment. We have leading retail share in the crew cab segment. And as we continue the light-duty truck rollout in Q3 and Q4, we expect share in the high value and high volume of the market to increase. We also see opportunity for share improvement, as we tap into profitable fleet business and launch diesel models later this year. Switching to crossovers, our crossovers performed well in the quarter with U.S. deliveries growing 17% year-over-year, a Q2 record. We're gaining market share in the crossover segment and are seeing positive contribution to year-over-year profitability. We will keep expanding our crossover portfolio with the 2020 Encore GX and 2021 Trailblazer, which we revealed in May. Cost pressures from increased depreciation and lower pension income were more than offset by our transformational cost savings. Let's move to GM International. For the second quarter, EBIT-adjusted in GMI was down $200 million year-over-year, driven by lower equity income in China, partially offset by the favorable impact from restructuring actions in Korea and continued business improvement actions in South America. In China, Q2 equity income was down $400 million year-over-year from record Q2 2018 levels. Industry in China deteriorated further in Q2 and the market experienced significant pricing pressures including pricing disruption from the early transition from China V to China VI emission requirements in many provinces. We reduced dealer inventory by 10% in Q2 with wholesale volume and production down approximately 25% year-over-year, which more than offset production and retail sales by approximately 12% year-over-year. These headwinds were partially offset by continued material and other cost performance. In the second half of the year, we expect these ongoing headwinds to be partially offset by vehicle launches. As a result, we expect equity income in the second half of the year to be generally in line with first half of 2019. In South America, we continue to make progress with the turnaround of our business despite the volatility in the region. We're starting to see cost savings, as a result of business improvement actions that we're undertaking together with other stakeholders. We have a strong franchise in South America with leading market share, strong dealer network and efficient manufacturing operations. We expect to see improvement as we progress through the remainder of the year as the launch for our global family of vehicles ramp and we deliver a stronger more competitive portfolio of vehicles. A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial posted record quarterly revenue of $3.6 billion in the second quarter and EBT-adjusted of $500 million, primarily as a result of portfolio growth. Cruise costs were $300 million for the quarter, on track with the approximately $1 billion communicated previously for the full year as we increase our headcount. Corp segment costs in the second quarter were $200 million -- unfavorable $200 million year-over-year due to approximately $170 million gain from our Lyft and PSA investments in the second quarter of last year and a loss of approximately $30 million in the second quarter of this year. We continue to expect the underlying spend in the Corp segment to be about $1 billion in 2019. We have made significant progress on our transformational cost savings initiative achieving $1.1 billion in year-to-date savings, $700 million of which was in the second quarter. Before I close, I want to reiterate our outlook for the calendar year. At the beginning of the year, we outlined a number of puts and takes in our outlook including headwinds from downtime, depreciation, pension, commodity and weakness in China. On the tailwind side, we discussed the full year benefit of our truck launch $2 billion to $2.5 billion of transformational cost savings in 2019, growth in adjacencies and a meaningful benefit from crossovers and the rollout of our global family of vehicles. Since January, we have experienced continued weakness in China and volatility in South America, which is offset by favorability to our previously communicated $1 billion headwind year-over-year from commodity and tariffs. Therefore, we are reiterating our outlook with EPS-adjusted in the range of $6.50 to $7, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the range of $4.5 billion to $6 billion. As I have mentioned before, this outlook assumes zero performance from our investments in Lyft or PSA. And any impact from these investments is not included in our guidance. Regarding cadence in 2019, we expect the second half of the year to be meaningfully stronger from both an EBIT and free cash flow perspective due to a number of launches in the second half as well as cycling past the downtime in North America. In summary, we had solid performance in Q2. And this sets us up well for strong performance in the second half. This concludes the opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Question-and: Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions] And your first question from the line of Rod Lache, Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. Mary Barra : Good morning. Rod Lache : Had a few questions about the guidance. Just first of all, the full year guidance for free cash flow is $4.5 billion to $6 billion. There was a first half burn of $1.4 billion. So that implies $5.9 billion to $7.4 billion in the back half. And if we're doing our math right that's excluding working capital maybe $3 billion to $4.5 billion, wanted to know if that sounds about right to you. And my associated question is can we extrapolate from that kind of a free cash flow run rate ex working capital, which would imply $6 billion to $9 billion annualized free cash flow at this point? Or is there is some kind of seasonality or something else that we should be taking into account if we do that math? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes thanks Rod. And I think directionally, you're correct. As you think about the second half of the year from a free cash flow perspective these trends are going to be driven by EBIT improvement as well as the working capital rewind that we're going to experience as we have cycled past the downtime. And extrapolating, I don't want to provide guidance beyond 2019 but I'll give you the puts and takes. We are going to continue to see benefits from our truck launch. We're going to see the remaining cost savings flow through into 2020. And as you may recall, we also talked about our capital spend tailwind from that in 2020 as well partially offset by lower China equity income dividends flowing into 2020. In fact, I'd caution you though extrapolating off of the second half there are some timing items like the working capital that you mentioned as well as first half versus second half some payments are lumped in the first half of the year and you can't really do it two times in the second half. But directionally looking at the puts and takes I'd say you're correct. Rod Lache : Okay. Great. And \u2013 Dhivya Suryadevara : And also Rod you heard us say in the beginning of the year, we have an intense focus on cash flow and cash conversion. And as you \u2013 as we go beyond 2019 into 2020 you're going to continue to see us reiterate that as we go forward here. Rod Lache : Yeah. It sounds like generally those payments are lumped into the first half, which \u2013 that's helpful to get some color on how to think about that. Is it reasonable to assume that CapEx comes towards the low-end of your guidance? And you did comment in your release about the timing of China dividends being a little bit unusual this year. What's included in the back half from China? Dhivya Suryadevara : We would say the remaining dividends that we have not yet received from China will flow through so it's more evenly distribute this year between first and second half than it has been last year. And from a next year perspective timing and as you know in the first quarter of the year we tend to from a seasonal perspective pay out a number of payments as well as the AR and AP rewind typically happens at that time. So I'd say, those two are the primary adjustments that I would think about. And China dividend you can expect, again a similar kind of cadence in 2020 probably as you will in 2019. Rod Lache : Okay. Dhivya Suryadevara : And from a CapEx standpoint, yeah, from a CapEx standpoint I'd say we gave a range of $8 billion to $9 billion. We will continue to do that. Obviously there's timing between among quarters. And I wouldn't read too much into that at this point in the middle of the year. Rod Lache : Okay. And just lastly your expectations for China, can you just broadly talk about what the inventory situation is for you? And you're talking about that half being flat with the first half. But the first half at least in the second quarter included a significant inventory correction. So what's the underlying business look like for you? And what are some of the puts and takes there? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. Sure. So we did unwind 70,000 units or so of inventory so about 10% of our inventory did unwind in the second quarter. But as Mary mentioned in her comments as we think about the industry obviously, we've just cycled past the China V and China VI transition. There is likely to have been some pull-ahead and we've got to watch that. We just don't know yet. And from a pricing standpoint, again driven by this transition, we experienced more pricing pressures in Q2. That's something to keep an eye on. So, as we look into the second half of the year, a slightly weaker industry an uncertain price environment, but really offset by the launches that we have significant launches into the sweet-spot of the segments with two-thirds of our launches coming from crossovers. So all the positives from a launch perspective we continue to expect. We're keeping an eye on macro. Rod Lache : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thank you. Mary Barra : Thank you. Ryan Brinkman : You know, clearly some moderation on your China profit outlook was expected given the softer volumes in the first half. Just curious though if you are now calling for a sequential deterioration in the industry in the back half versus the front half. Because previously you were looking forward for some company-specific catalysts for higher profits in the back half including a freshened lineup introduction of the GEM platform et cetera. I would think too maybe you could cycle past some of the inventory drawdown in Q2 ahead of China VI. So visibility in the market there is low I know. But if there were flat industry sales in 2H versus 1H do you think in that environment you could manage to a higher China profit in the back half? Mary Barra : I think that that's one element. But with the intense pricing pressure as Dhivya said that we don't know with the intense pricing we saw to move the China V how is that going to carry through. And then from a GM specific these launches are very important because we are seeing the customer preference shifting as well as we have some older models in really popular segments. So I think its -- Ryan it's just too hard to say with all the volatility that we're facing right now. I would tell you the team is very focused and we have a China team that is very good at looking at every single cost opportunity. We saw that performance in the first half. We'll continue to look for that and to increase that. And then also we're working very closely with our partner to seize opportunities as there are possibly ups or downs to the marketplace. But it's just -- it's too hard to predict. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly for me clearly the earnings power of the new full-size truck platform was on display in 2Q. But it wasn't on full display right? Because there was still lost production during the quarter in the changeover to the heavy-duty versions the SUVs haven't launched. So to help us sort of better understand what magnitude of the earnings potential of this program was on display in the quarter can you kind of sketch-out what has launched, what has yet to launch SUVs higher-efficiency diesels the even bigger pickups with Navistar et cetera and the relative profit potential of those various pieces? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, Ryan I'd say, if you think about the first half we started out with crew cabs as we talked about. And towards the second quarter and really going into third quarter and fourth quarter is when you're going to see the rest of the light-duty start to normalize so the remaining variants whether it's regular or double. And diesel is an important factor that Mary pointed out. We're excited about that and that's going to be coming up next in the Q3 time frame and followed by heavy-duty. If you think about the first half of the year we took downtime of about 25000 or so units in heavy-duty which to your point was an offset against the light-duty earnings power that we saw. So you're not going to see that in the second half of the year. And in fact with the additional capacity that we have added for both light-duties and heavy-duties you're going to still start to see tailwinds from volume because we have been constrained on these as we have been in the past few quarters and years here. So plus side would be the remaining light-duty variants including diesel the heavy-duty going into next year obviously the SUVs and the absence of downtime as well as obviously the price and mix benefit that you'll start to see in HD and other variants that we have so far seen in crew cab. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning, everybody. Just really wanted to make sure I followed up and got that correctly Dhivya on the truck side. So basically in the first half you had the HD downtime and the SUV downtime. The HD pickups will benefit us some time in the third quarter, but mostly in the fourth quarter. And then the SUV bounces back in the intro is in the first or second quarter of next year. So I mean, it looks like with these truck swing it's something well north of $0.5 billion per quarter once this all gets worked out. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I'd say the cadence that you've roughly gotten is right. We have not talked about the SUV timing specifically. It will be early next year. But I think directionally you're correct in terms of the tailwinds that we will start to see in the second half of the year. First, you'll see that in light-duty remaining variants and then going into heavy-duty probably in the Q4 time frame and obviously into next year. And then the -- you'll see the SUVs. So I'd say your directionally correct. John Murphy : Okay. And is there any reason that we should think that second quarter is not a good quarter to walk off of when we think about those improvements? I mean, it seems like this was just a very good operational quarter and then you'll get the benefit of those [indiscernible] going forward. I mean, is there anything unusual that we should think about that wouldn't make this a good base case to work off of? Dhivya Suryadevara : No, I'd say its a pretty good base case. Obviously, you've got to adjust for the heavy-duty downtime that we took in the second quarter that is not -- you can't extrapolate that into the rest of the year. Cost savings as you know we achieved the $700 million. So that's also on a pretty -- on a kind of run rate that you can continue to expect for the rest of the year. We will probably see some tailwinds as well coming from the XT6 launch, which we're just starting to see. And probably second half of the year will be more of a tailwind than we have seen in crossovers because of that. So I'd say otherwise Q2 is a good baseline. John Murphy : Okay, helpful. Second question when we think about GM Financial, I mean obviously it's performing very well. We keep kind of following up on this question. But when do you see sort of at a maturation point where it could start taking some capital back up to the parent company? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I'd say that last year you may recall we took about $375 million of dividends from GMF. They're still growing their earning assets and we're close to about $100 billion of earning assets. When we think about steady-state for GMF, we're thinking somewhere in the $125 billion to $130 billion range for earning assets. It's going to take a couple of years for that to take hold. And the penetrations we were running at is in the 45% to 50% range which is something we would like to see continue. And capital we will -- as the leverage ratio continues to grind down with the equity building up and earning assets leveling off, we're going to see the dividend increase over a period of time. And eventually, you're going to see the entire net income from GMF come back to the parent. John Murphy : Got it. Then just lastly, on suppliers, we've heard a lot of noise about some slight incremental pricing pressure coming into the supply base. I'm just curious as you look at your relationship with suppliers, is there any stress building in the supply base? Or sort of conversely is there any more opportunity to work more collaboratively with them and get more pricing out of the system? Mary Barra : So we've worked over the last couple of years to build a really strong relationship with our suppliers and focusing on innovation. And then when we focus on price and costs, it's doing it together and looking how can we work together to take cost out that benefits both General Motors and the supplier. We're going to continue to do that and look for those opportunities and build on that. So I don't -- we don't -- I don't see any major change coming. I think you'll see us working even more closely together. John Murphy : Mary, I apologize if I could sneak one more in. It sounds like you've got 1,700 of the 2,800 UAW folks relocated. I'm just curious when you think outside of the headcount of the UAW, if you could just talk about your hiring in the U.S. maybe more broadly and the growth in the employment base, so I can understand sort of your position in the employment picture for the U.S.? Mary Barra : Are you talking about from a represented workforce or from a salaried workforce? John Murphy : More from a total workforce, because it sounds like you've done -- you're about almost two-thirds of the way of reworking -- or should I say relocating these workers. I'm just curious\u2026 Mary Barra : So on this... John Murphy : Particularly thinking about growth. Mary Barra : I didn't hear your last comment. I'm sorry. John Murphy : I'm sorry. Particularly thinking about the growth in Cruise as well, right. I mean, because you have real headcount growth in certain areas. Mary Barra : So I think you have to look at it in three buckets. As we said, we have jobs for every single hourly employee in the United States that was impacted by the transformation. And we'll continue to do those placements and then look at what is natural retirement. And I predict by the time we get through this we'll be hiring for the needs that we have across the United States. So that's from a represented perspective. On the salary workforce, in general, we very carefully planned the transformation activities, not only reducing our overall salaried headcount, but also making sure we had resources in there with the right skill set. That went very well. And we are hiring now to replace attrition, but maintaining the lower cost level that we've worked so hard to get at Q4 and Q1 of this year. And then as it specifically relates to Cruise, we have about 1,500 employees there now and we are working hard to hire and get to that level of that 2,000 by year-end. And the hiring is going very well there. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks good morning. Just wanted to get back into the pickup truck market dynamics, I know there's a lot of noise out there. But as you just laid out -- you still have a lot more product to go. You've added some capacity. I know you're not giving 2020 guidance. But at a high level is there any reason to believe that if the market holds up that the volume on the pickups should be materially different than what you expect this year? Like is there anything internally at GM like maybe a quick refresh of a product or something that would reinvigorate some downtime? Dhivya Suryadevara : No. We're not anticipating any specific downtime related to a changeover or anything Joe. So I'd say probably you can extrapolate normal run rates excluding downtime and plus the capacity we've added. We've been in like a ramp-up-type mode. And obviously you'll get to a full line rate as you cycle past the downtime. So in a similar macro environment and we think that again the truck market with its percentage penetration of the industry continues to be healthy and we would expect -- I think you're directionally right for the volume. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then secondly on GMI and China, I know it's still challenged and you sort of mentioned this that there's some I guess encouragement underneath. It looks like it was $200 million better year-over-year. And I'm assuming FX was still probably a headwind within that. So how do you -- how do we think about the opportunity in really Brazil and South Korea as we go forward? Mary Barra : So if you just kind of cycle through from a Korea perspective, we accomplished what we've set out in the restructuring and now we continue to see that business unit perform. We still have a few markets in GMI that we're evaluating to look at how do we create a successful foundation to build on in a few of the GMI markets. And then in South America we have a very strong franchise there. It definitely is being impacted by FX and the macro situation. We continue to work with all of our stakeholders though to take cost out. And that team has demonstrated a great ability to do that. And we can define our plan for that region to take into account we think there's going to just be a continued volatility. I think important to note in many of these regions though is we are just in the process of doing the first global family of vehicles that will be rolling out not only in China, but also South America and then flow to some of these other markets. So I think we're going to have a very strong portfolio and vehicles in the market to take advantage as South America recovers or to continue to outperform, even if we keep in these market. So there's great focus on all of these markets. We are seeing improvement year-over-year and we'll continue until we get this region to be contributing and covering as best as we can. Joseph Spak : Just a follow-up. Would you classify the potential improvement in South America more driven by the fixed cost reduction from working with the stakeholders or the launch of the GEM platforms which as you've indicated in the past should be more profitable than the outgoing? Mary Barra : I think it's both. All of them are significant in helping us achieve where we need to go in South America. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you, good morning and congrats. Just going back to the pickup discussion. Just curious how the Silverado mid-trims, like the LT trims are performing kind of versus your expectations in the market. Because we are seeing some signs that the inventory there has been rising on those particular trims. I know after a while, it is coming off later in the year. But just curious, how you're performing thus far in the middle trims of the LTs? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I'd say Itay, as you know we started out the launch focusing on the crew cabs. And we've been building inventory in the mid-levels really now in the second quarter of the year. And the -- it's also important to note, we're normalizing our propulsion mix there as well. And during launch -- obviously it's hard to extrapolate out of one data point on what the inventory picture needs to be because we are still rolling all of these out and there will be balancing that happens in the rest of the year as well. And as we -- as I said once we're rolling out these other variants you will see the inventory picture starting to normalize. And we have a plan looking at the end of the year to get our inventory to exactly where we want our target levels to be. Itay Michaeli : Got it. I think, that's very helpful. And then switching back to China and I apologize if I missed this, but can you share any year-end inventory targets that you have, as well as just how this year's events might be influencing your longer-term view of profitability in China? Mary Barra : So when we look at the inventory, we are working to be disciplined with the inventory levels, but also be prepared for the opportunities with that volatility. So at the most senior level discussions with our partner, we're watching it very closely and giving direction to the team. So we're going to manage it to get to the right level as we go forward. I'm not going to share a specific target. When you look at it over a longer term, we have a very strong franchise in China. We have three strong global brands with Cadillac, Buick and Chevrolet as well as the two domestic brands with Wuling and Baojun. And we think it's a very strong franchise. We think over the long term, there are significant opportunities for growth. And also, China is a very important part of our electrification strategy, of seizing the opportunity in such a large market to get the scale from an EV perspective that allows us to be better positioned, I believe, in other markets like North America as we launch EV. So over the longer term, we still see a very strong opportunity, especially with our global brands. Itay Michaeli : That's helpful. I just had a quick one, the last question, Mary. Just given the feedback you cited earlier on the Super Cruise system, any change in plans on number of vehicles? Or how quickly you might roll out the Super Cruise system? Or how you might go to market with the next-generation Ultra Cruise system? Mary Barra : So, I would just appreciate the question. And we're really excited about Super Cruise. In my career, rarely do you see a feature in technology that has such a strong support from the customers saying, I would strongly prefer this technology to be on my next car or I won't buy a car without it. So that I think is a really good endorsement of the way the technology works and the benefit and value it provides to the customer. So we are in the process of rolling it out across all Cadillacs and then we'll look for the right opportunities as we roll it out across more segments and brands in our portfolio. And we'll do that as quickly as we can, but making sure that we're focused on the safety and quality of it as we do that. And then, as you mentioned with Ultra Cruise, this is a technology you saw us continue to improve it with the number of places you can use it. We're going to continue to add capability. And we're very excited about it and the road map that we have. So we'll be rolling it out as quickly as we can, with again having a strong focus on safety. Itay Michaeli : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. Good morning. Want to talk a little bit about the GMNA earnings walk on the supplement slide. Can you kind of break that $700 million of performance timing? Timing would seem to imply that some of those reverse. So maybe what was that? And then, as we think about how would commodities peak in performance or would that be the material headwind, maybe less of a headwind? And then how do we kind of take the $4.5 billion-or-so restructuring cost saves and kind of look for it in this performance/timing line model? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, sure. So, if you're starting with the $4.5 billion I'll do the total company walk for you Brian, because there's North America versus total company. The $4.5 billion pertain to the total company. In the total company walk, as you can see in the cost bucket, we had performance and timing of $1 billion -- $900 million positive, close to $1 billion. Out of that -- so the $700 million that I referenced from the transformation cost savings is in the $900 million. There's about $100 million-ish of timing and another $100 million of commercial and technical savings that are coming from our regular material cost initiative. So think of timing as about $100 million. And as you go into the second half of the year, this is the bucket, the cost bucket is where you will see the performance show up. Obviously, it will be offset by the pension and depreciation and amortization headwinds that we have talked about. But that's the geography of it. And from a material cost standpoint, it will be in the materials line item within the cost bucket as well. Brian Johnson : Okay. And second question, as we go into second half North America and the lower trim levels of the light-duty truck getting rolled out, how should we be thinking about the mix/price walks in the second half? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. I'd say overall second half volume will be up versus first half because of the factors that I mentioned on heavy-duty being up, SUV being up and light-duties as well slightly up. So volume will be up. And therefore mix will be -- there's an offsetting factor to your point of the other mix is rolling out. But the heavy-duty negative mix element that you saw in the first half of the year will not repeat it will actually be a positive that will offset some of that. And obviously, the SUV aspect as well you saw it down in the first half and you're not going to see that. So vol mixed together will be where the bulk of the improvement from H1 versus H2 is going to be. Brian Johnson : Okay. And just final question, can you put into context the Cruise announcement, which you build as positive in terms of testing and increasing the fleet size? But much of the tech press kind of said -- indicated that robotaxis, whether it's huge Waymo some of the start-ups are still a number of years out. So maybe kind of update us on \u2013 yes, we know that safety is a gating factor, but just how you're thinking about timing? Mary Barra : Well, I think anytime you're working on something that's never been done before a brand-new technology, a timeline is likely to move around a little bit. But we do -- we have line of sight in what we need to accomplish both from the technology development. We have a very robust milestones that we have to achieve. And we also believe there -- and we're working hard to make sure we have the right regulatory environment as well. So I'm not going to put a specific time out there. I just would say we have line of sight. And I think the significant work that we're doing to get deeper validation more miles that we'll achieve in the second half of this year, while working on improving public receptivity are going to be very important to allow us to have a large-scale deployment. So that would be the comments I make regarding Cruise. So I'm very pleased with the progress the team is making continues to make their pushing very hard. And this focus on not only the technology, but the environment and the customer I think is very appropriate. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a good quarter. Can we just go back to pickup? You've lost a lot of, I mean, I know you've highlighted you gained retail share, but you have lost share overall in the segment year-to-date. What is the outlook for the second half? I mean, is guidance predicated on holding your share from where it is now and the benefit of just sort of plants being fully up and running? Or do you expect to regain share in the second? Dhivya Suryadevara : We do see a growth in share in the lower end of the ATP segment Colin. I'd say that if you look at the increased share that we have had it's been in the $45,000 to $50,000 and $50,000 plus-type segments obviously the more profitable segments. And we expect to hold that, because we were underrepresented in these segments with our K2 product. And what we're really doing is like fixing that under-representation if you will as we go into T1. So you expect normalization in the lower ATP segments. And obviously, as heavy-duty rolls out that will be the other positive as well and diesels coming in. So we do expect to increase share in the second half of the year between all the other cab variants as well as HD. Colin Langan : And how about on the commercial side? Because on pickup, I mean, I know retail is obviously always more profitable. But in pickups I imagine the business is still quite lucrative. I mean, do you have plans to try to recapture some of that share? Or is it just not worth the chase? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. No, we do believe that we will grow in that segment as well. And as you point out fleet in pickup trucks continues to be profitable not as much as retail, but profitable. And we will absolutely continue to grow in that market as well. And with all the capacity issues, we've had and with the launch changeover and so on and so forth that is something that has been again underrepresented in the first half of the year. And that's something we will correct in the second half. Colin Langan : And lastly, any color -- I think you mentioned in your comment that the original guidance had about $1 billion of FX and commodity. Obviously, within this quarter steel price is another key commodity that's really fallen pretty dramatically in Q2. Does that actually result in a tailwind through the rest of the year? Is that one of the factors helping to offset the weakness in China? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah, that's correct. So we -- you may remember, Colin, January of this year, we said $1 billion headwind in commodities. We did not talk about FX in that context, commodities and tariffs year-over-year. As we sit here today to your point, we have seen a moderation in steel and aluminum prices specifically. There's a couple of commodities that are still elevated. But on balance we think that the headwind is probably closer to half of what we originally expected and that's serving to offset some of the international volatility that we're seeing and that's how -- that's to your point how the guidance comes about. Colin Langan : Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Yeah. Great. Maybe can we just get into very specifically your carryover pricing was I think more positive than most folks would have thought in the quarter, and I didn't know if there are any specific products that you could call out both in North America as well as in GMI, because I think there was $100 million favorable in both, whereas historically that's typically a headwind year-over-year. So I wanted to understand that dynamic on carryover. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. Good question David. In the international side a lot of that is catch-up FX pricing that you see in Brazil and in Argentina. As you know, we try to price out in Argentina all of our FX headwinds and Brazil in line with the inflation there. So that's the international fees. In the United States, as you see, our carryover, a lot of it was driven by positivity in our car segment. And as you know, we have significantly ramped down our overall car portfolio. It used to be a headwind from a carryover pricing perspective in 2018, and as we have lowering of inventory there we're able to maintain a price discipline there as well. That's I'd say the primary factor. Cadillac is continuing to do really well. So the residual value improvements that we're seeing in Cadillac are flowing through to the crossovers that we currently have on the road as well. Those are the two big factors I'd point out. David Tamberrino : Okay. I mean on the GMI side, it sounds like that could continue into the back half. But for North America, is that something that should continue even though you've got the wind-down of passenger cars? I mean looking at 3Q of 2018 you had a very strong pricing quarter. So just trying to understand the dynamics there. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. I'd say, we'd probably continue to see the car discipline as the inventory there winds down over time. Crossover should be pretty strong as well. There's obviously a bifurcation between small and compact crossover versus the mid-size crossover. So, on the mid-size we will see a continued positive but pressures from the compact and smaller side. So, I'd say on balance probably to your point it's a harder comp versus last year. So maybe a little bit more of a headwind from a carryover perspective, but the car and crossover specific segment should continue to hold up. David Tamberrino : Okay. And then Mary, you had a couple of questions earlier on Cruise. I want to dive a little bit more into that. It's gated by safety and regulation. What impediments are you running into from a technical and regulatory perspective; one, that kind of helped drive this -- I won't call it a pushout but a little bit delayed timing from the 2019 commercial deployment? And then secondly, what's the plan to improve the public receptivity for a large-scale deployment? Is it something like what Waymo's done in Phoenix so far, with a technician still in the vehicle behind it and getting folks used to the technology? Or should I be investing in something else? Mary Barra : Well, I think, when we talk about deploying our deployment will be when we can have the vehicle operate safely without a safety trainer in the vehicle. So that's point one. I just think to build, kind of, the trust that we're looking for -- a lot of it is communication. And so, we have a very well thought out marketing plan that will be targeted to the first city that we plan to deploy in which is San Francisco, so very focused. For people who see the vehicles on the road today to understand them better to be able to articulate the safety in the vehicle, what we're doing to create this safe environment and that we can really improve road safety and because of the discipline that is -- on AV doesn't drive, follows all the road laws and doesn't also drive under the influence of anything. And so you're going to see us have a marketing campaign to engage the city, so they understand what's happening and they're more I think receptive to what's coming. And then from a technical perspective, I would say just again, as you are developing new technology and you have milestones that you need to meet to ensure that the AV is going to be safer than a human driver you have to keep making those. But clearly, some of the enablers will be as we continue on our hiring getting the best engineers working for Cruise on this. And I think, what also has happened is everybody understands just how complex this is to do well and to truly have the vehicle that can operate safely. So we're on that journey. The rate of iteration continues to be very strong. And we'll do the testing and the validation to achieve our milestones, while in parallel be working on continuing to gain regulatory approval. And I wouldn't say there's impediments there, it's just work that still needs to be done. I think NHTSA understands the importance of this technology from a safety perspective. And so I think there's a line of sight to be able to get the regulatory approval and then building that trust with the consumer is going to be important. Those are the three paths that we're on together or in parallel. And we're going to continue to work all three aggressively. David Tamberrino : Understood. And just as a follow-up on the technical side. Is everything underneath your control? Or are you relying upon any step change in technology from a supplier at this point noted [indiscernible]? Mary Barra : Everything is under our control. David Tamberrino : Okay. Thank you, Mary. Thank you, Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Dave \u2013 I am sorry, Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning. And thank you for taking the questions. I want to start with just a couple of quick financial questions and then a strategic question. Just first on the raw mat side I know you talked to some of those pressures being mitigated. If I go back to call it last year you had I believe in North America something like $1.4 billion in commodity headwinds. And now here we are with steel back at where it was in 2017. Now I know that your raw mat headwinds there's other stuff in there whether its aluminum or precious metals et cetera. And that stuff has changed differently. But why wouldn't most of that headwind that $1.4 billion headwind from 2018 reverse given where steel prices is over time? I know, there's timing around the contracts. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah. I think we are starting to see the tailwinds in a lot of the commodities that you're talking about Dan. I'd say steel we're starting to see pretty significant tailwinds and aluminum as well. There's a few other commodities that I referenced earlier particularly palladium, which is at a level that remains significantly elevated versus even what we saw in January. And against, a relatively smaller purchase value, it's quite a significant headwind. And over time you will see things flow through. And obviously, there's still uncertainty around tariffs as well. And we therefore, felt it's prudent to get it to a \u2013 to a closer to half type of a number. We had $1 billion earlier and we're getting it now down to $500 million. We will keep watching it and flowing that through as we see the improvements come through. And we also have the lag effect that, we experience since these don't get indexed right away. They get indexed a little later. So you'll see the improvement come through if the market continues to hold up. Dan Levy : On that lagged effect what's the typical timing? Let's say like steel sort of stays flat where it is right now, how long would it take to fully sort of offset those headwinds? Is it like 18 months? Dhivya Suryadevara : There's \u2013 we have indexed contracts for a portion of it and we have negotiated contracts for the rest of it. And that's over \u2013 the timing is all over the place. So from an indexed perspective you would see a lag of about three months and having that come through. From a negotiated perspective our contracts roll out a-third, a-third, a-third type on a yearly basis, so some of this might be a bit more nuanced in negotiated. So, not one metric that you can apply across the board. Dan Levy : Got it. Thank you. And then just as far as the UAW negotiations go, I apologize if I missed it earlier, but have you signaled in sort of what a good placeholder bonus amount to assume in the fourth quarter? Because I know Ford has signaled some kind of amount something that you noted. Mary Barra : No, we haven't. I mean, we are approaching negotiations looking forward to having productive discussions. There are numerous topics that affect our employees and our business that we need to discuss and talk about which we'll do. And we're looking to do that constructively making sure we can address business challenges in a way that allows us to really build a stronger future for our employees, for our customers and for the company, which will benefit our shareholders. So, that's our approach to UAW negotiations. And we have not signaled any specific financial aspect to that. Dan Levy : Got it. And then just want to ask a strategic question. When you look around in the EV landscape and you've obviously seen some collaboration amongst automakers trying to thread the investments you've taken a slightly different approach. So, far it's been a bit more go-it-alone approach. So, I guess my question is -- and you don't have the same considerations in that you don't have to deal with this Europe. And obviously you're not doing -- being forced into this as much. But would you ever consider allowing other automakers to use your best platform sort of what VW is doing with NEV? I mean would that help with scale? Would that help with profitability? Mary Barra : Well, Dan I would say is what we are doing is we have an arrangement with Honda. So, we have already -- Honda has already partnered with us on the cell technology and some of the electric vehicle components. So, I think we were actually one of the first -- I think if not the first to do that. And as we move forward if it make -- we are open to working with other OEs and leveraging it even further. But we're already doing that with Honda. And it definitely provides savings from an engineering perspective and has scale benefits as well. Dan Levy : And scale as a crucial part to reaching breakeven I assume on EVs? Mary Barra : Scale is I'd say one of many. But scale does -- especially as you get to a certain level to drive the right scale as you look at the cell and battery manufacturer for sure. Dan Levy : Got it. Thank you very much. Mary Barra : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Good morning everybody. Mary Barra : Good morning. Dhivya Suryadevara : Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : So, first question around the reiterated guidance. It's obviously a lot of moving pieces. And this industry is quite volatile. But it's also fairly wide range despite pretty decent line of sight that you seem to have on some of the GMNA dynamics in the second half. Can you maybe just remind us what the variance factors are between sort of like the high end and the low end as it relates to earnings and even more so as it relates to free cash flow? Mary Barra : I would say I think through the call we've highlighted the fact that there's definitely some tailwinds, there's also some headwinds. And I think what at General Motors we try to do is we stated the guidance at the beginning of the year. Dhivya and I both remained very confident that we're going to be able to meet our commitment. And so we're confident in our full year guidance. But there are -- it's a very dynamic environment when you look at trade and you look at China and you look at macro conditions in some of our GMI markets, then you look at the positives we have with the full-size truck franchise and how we're moving that forward just really early days in the launch also the strength of our crossovers and the growth that we have in Cadillac. So, there's definitely tailwinds, there's definitely headwinds. And what we're saying is we are committed and we have definitely a line of sight. And we'll work through the variability that we see or the volatility in the second half of this year to be able to deliver and maintain our guidance. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that's helpful. Then I guess turning to your restructuring program. It's nice to see that you're on track for the $2 billion to $2.5 billion benefit this year. There's obviously a whole other chunk of $2 billion to $2.5 billion expected to come next year. Can you maybe point us to specific incremental actions that would deliver these additional savings as we get into next year as a way to get a number on that? Mary Barra : Well, I think when we laid it out I mean some of them are just timing of when the cost comes out, but we have very detailed plans. We're -- the fact that when we announced it we said, this is how much we'll be in 2019 and the balance in 2020. And we're on track to achieve that. It's just we're systematically executing these plans. One of the very first accomplished was the salaried headcount rightsizing that we did in Q4 and Q1 of this year. But every single element it was a third, a third, a third between engineering, between manufacturing, and between SG&A. So, those are all on track. And I think -- I guess that you look at what we've been able to deliver so far and that should give you confidence that we're on track to do that for 2020 as well. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then just finally a big driver of your China outlook seems to be product launches especially in the profitable attractive segment. Can you maybe just remind us specific examples of what's coming out and to the extent that it will be helpful for the 2020 outlook as well? Mary Barra : Well we definitely have our GEM products that are coming out that are going to be very important. We have some crossover vehicles also Cadillac. The XT6 we think is going to be very significant. We also have some Baojun products in an important crossover-type segment so -- and then also the CT5 that will be launched there. So if you look at it there is a many SUVs crossovers luxury vehicles coming out across all of our brands in Q3 and Q4 that I think will position us well. Because what we have seen why these launches are so important as I mentioned because we are seeing customer preferences shift to more SUV crossover and we also are -- because of the competitive nature having an all-new model will be very significant in the marketplace. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : Thanks guys. I'm probably going to revisit a little bit of some of the questions already asked. But maybe just try it at a different angle. When we look at the second half, I think everyone's thinking that's a relatively clean view of you don't have the downtime raw mats are probably more rightsized. When we think next year in terms of just the walk you obviously have cost cuts, but just any headwinds that you can call out? You talked about production and the mix. But does some of the UAW cost did they flow through from Q4 to next year? Any inflationary pressures? So like is D&A going to be a significant headwind again next year? And then any launch costs whether that's content or incentives you could call out? Just things that sort of bring the walk down for 2020 even qualitatively would be very helpful. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. Obviously, as Mary mentioned, it's hard to predict what the environment in 2020 is going to look like sitting here in the middle of 2019. I think you've captured the product-related tailwinds really well. D&A and pension income are something -- the two items that we have always said are going to be secularly normalizing to a higher level for D&A and a lower level for pension. So, that's one item that we have actually attributed. If you remember our cash conversion, one of the factors on how it's going to normalize is the fact that these items will continue to get to their more financial steady-state levels. But other than that, it would be speculation if I were to be thinking of any other items. I think we'll continue executing. And the cost savings that Mary mentioned as well is going to be an enabler as we look into 2020. Chris McNally : That's great. And then maybe I can just hop to a little bit more of a secular question. It's probably not as sexy as autonomous. But when we think about ADAS particularly in North America not Europe, it's not mandated. And if we look at sort of the Detroit Three you've been sort of slow on the rollout of what's a pretty attractive technology. It's not that it's not available, but it's essentially -- customers are still paying for it versus being standard. Could you just maybe talk about the rollout of some of the low ends not Super Cruise? But I'm just basically thinking AV/EV. Is there a chance that that becomes a standard offering product similar to the way Toyota and some of the Japanese have rolled it out? Mary Barra : So we're committed to have ADAS across the entire portfolio. And it's a segment-by-segment question that we look at to see what makes sense because we also want to -- if you have so much safety technology on a vehicle that the customer can't afford it then they don't get the opportunity to achieve that. So we're trying to be very customer-focused segment-by-segment. We clearly have the technology and pretty comprehensive technology, safety technology when you walk around the vehicle. We are -- have done some I think really good work to make sure if it's not standard, it's available in a first package as opposed to a last package being receptive to what -- and really giving the customer choice. So we're going to continue to do that develop the technology, have it available across the portfolio in some cases it will be standard. And then we're going to continue to really work and gain -- I know you said not necessarily Super Cruise, but I think the game-changing nature of Super Cruise also I think is very important that we're committed to and growing the feature and functionality of it. Chris McNally : Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Barra : Well, we appreciate that everybody participated in the call this morning. And as I said just a few minutes ago, as we continue in the second half of the year, I remain confident in our full year guidance. It's based on where we're at in the truck launch and the opportunities that lie ahead especially with heavy-duty models yet this year and then the strength of our crossovers as well. We're also on track as I mentioned to deliver the cost savings associated with the business transformation. And with a good chunk of it already behind us then we continue to have -- execute well-defined plans. And as we step back we recognize that there are challenges. But as we look at it, the reward for overcoming these challenges and being very disciplined is that we get the privilege of working on the future of transportation of being able to lead the industry as we look at EV and AV and giving customers more accessibility and more choice. So we are committed and fully working to win the race and make sure that we do create a stronger future for General Motors that will benefit our employees, our customers, and our shareholders. And that's the dedication of the entire GM team. So thank you all very much for participating. We hope you have a good day.

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday October 29, 2019. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks Dorothy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us, as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Our press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. I\u2019m joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President, CFO, and a number of other Executives. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rocky, and good morning everybody, and thank you joining the call. As you know, we have a ratified labor agreement and I am very glad that our highly skilled employees are back to work building winning cars, trucks, crossovers and components. From the outside, our goal was to reach an agreement that works for our shareholders, our employees and our company as we confirmed the realities of our rapidly transforming industry. A contract does the right thing for our employees without compromising competitiveness or flexibility. It includes improve half forward for our in progression and temporary workers that will create more engagements and a motivated team. This is foundational for our improving job satisfaction, health and safety, quality and productivity, all of which will strengthen the future of this company and creates shareholder value. The contract also affirms our commitment to a strong U.S. manufacturing base with planned investments totaling $7.7 billion. We'll secure the future of our Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant with an all-new electric pickup truck that builds on established truck leadership. We\u2019re also moving forward on an effort to bring battery cell production to the Mahoney Valley in Ohio, which will create 1,000 manufacturing jobs. Before I continue, I want to thank our dedicated suppliers. They were in constant contact with us throughout the work stoppage and ensuring as they would be ready for a prompt, safe restart once the new contract was ratified. And I'd also like to thank our dealers who helped us sustain our momentum in the marketplace and they worked very hard to minimize the inconvenience to our customers caused by our limited ability to shift service and repair part. To speed up recovery and get cars flowing to dealership, comprehensive plans are in place to allow the network to recover as quickly as possible. So now, we are moving forward as one team. However, we have a lot of work to do in many areas, as the loss profits from the work stoppage were significant. In a few minutes, Dhivya will talk about the financial impact of this drive and our full year outlook. Overall in the third quarter, we delivered net revenue of $35.5 billion, EBITDA adjusted of $3 billion, EBIT adjusted margin of 8.4%, EBIT, EPS diluted adjusted of $1.72, automotive adjusted free cash flow of $3.8 billion, and a ROIC adjusted of $21.9 on a trailing four quarters basis. Looking at North America, we delivered strong business performance in the quarter which was unfavorably impacted by the strike in the United States and increased warranty and retail cost related to our previous generation full size pickup trucks and full size SUV. Overall, retail deliveries rose 6% year-over-year led by double-digit gains and light-duty Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups and strong demand for our all new heavy-duty pickup trucks. Cadillac continues to capitalize on its expanding crossover portfolio in the United States and China. In the US, Cadillac crossover deliveries increased by 67% in the quarter led by the segment leading XT4 and the all-new XT6 which is gaining momentum in the market. In China, the XT4 and the new XT5 helped drive deliveries up 11%, amidst lower industry sales. With the XT6 joining the lineup, we expect Cadillac will further strengthen its position in China's growing luxury SUV segment. Our luxury sedan portfolio updates continue with the launch of the all new CT5 midsize luxury sedan in China this quarter by early next year by the U.S. built CT5 and CT4 in North America. Finally, as we look at meeting customer demand, our U.S. dealerships finished the third quarter with a healthy level of inventory. As the strike continued, our teams work tirelessly to ensure we could ship as many vehicles as possible to our dealers. However with no additional vehicles in the pipeline for many weeks, our dealer inventories will be temporary leaner than we'd like. The team is doing everything that's powered to restore our supply of vehicles back to normal levels. Regarding our international operations, in China, the business environment remains challenging and volatile. Year-over-year, industry vehicle sales declined nearly 11% in the quarter. We underperformed relative to the industry mostly because of segment shifts and lower demand for outgoing models, partially offset by growth in Cadillac delivery. In addition to taking appropriate cost actions, we are improving our product mix. We launched seven new models in third quarter with plans to launch five new and refresh models in the fourth quarter. In addition, the team continues to focus on accelerating cost reduction initiatives to improve performance, given the business environment. In South America, we continue to take steps to improve the business and protect our strong franchise while navigating FX and other macro challenges. In September, we launched the all new 2020 Chevrolet Onix plus in Brazil. It is the first model in South America from our new global family of vehicles and carries a five star safety rating. During its initial month on sale, customer demand greatly outpaced available supply and we are doubling our production this month. The Onix hedge back follows next month and together, we believe these new vehicles will further strengthen our Chevy brand leadership and Onix position as the region's bestselling vehicle. As we execute our turnaround plan for international operations, we continue to take decisive steps to achieve sustainable profitability in every market we participate and cease operations that are not. Earlier this week, we announced our intent to cease selling Chevrolet vehicles in Indonesia over the coming quarters. Turning to our EV progress, Chevrolet is launching the 2020 Bolt EV with battery improvements that enable an EPA estimated 259 miles of all electric range at a full charge at the same price. The more powerful battery pack is the same size and weight as previous year's models, but its greater energy density delivers 21 additional miles of range and that's more value to our customers. It's built on our industry leadership and improving battery range and reducing battery cell powers per kilowatt hour, and we expect this progress to continue. The 2020 Bolt also retains what our customers love about this vehicle, instant torque, excellent riding handling, and a zero to 60 times of just 6.5 seconds. And on the AV front, Cruise increased its testing and validation mile during the quarter and increased its community engagement and relationship building. In addition to Cruise, GM and Honda continued their joint development of a new purpose built shared autonomous vehicle. So to recap, our strong operating performances in the quarter were supported by a robust sale of trucks and crossovers in the United States. We've also made significant progress at our transformational cost initiatives. GM has achieved 2.4 billion and transformation cost savings in 2018 and is on track to realize our 2019 targets. Because of additional planned investments in U.S. manufacturing, we will revise our year-end 2020 cost savings started to arrange between $4 billion and $4.5 billion. We will take all of the necessary steps to achieve as much as possible to our original savings target. The strike did have a big impact on our Q3 EBIT adjusted results and will also significantly impact our Q4 results. Most of our 2019 strike-related production losses will not be recovered in 2019 because of capacity constraints. Therefore, we are revising our 2019 EPS-diluted adjusted in automotive, adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance. Our full year, updating EPS diluted adjusted outlook is now on the range or $4.50 to $4.80, and our new adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance is zero to $1 billion. I have asked the GM team to find every offset, now that production has resumed and I'm confident they will find many opportunities. So with that, I will turn it over to Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thanks, Mary, and good morning everybody. Today, I want to discuss our performance for the quarter, the impact of the strike, the labor agreement, and finally our outlook for the year. In the third quarter, we generated $35.5 billion in net revenues, $3 billion in EBIT adjusted 8.4% margin $1.72 an EPS diluted adjusted and $3.8 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. The EBIT adjusted impact of the strike in the third quarter was $1.3 billion on a gross basis. This reflects lost production of a richer product mix as we launched our high content, high margin heavy-duty crew cab, as well as the impact of last aftermarket sales. This impact was partially offset by approximately $300 million and strike related favorable of timing items. Net of these turning items, the EPS during the quarter was lowered by approximately $0.52, and the adjusted automotive free cash flow was lower by approximately $400 million due to the strike. Adjusting for the impact of the strike, EPS would have been $2.24 an all-time quarterly record. The $1.72 EPS diluted adjusted also includes a $0.15 loss from Lyft and PSA revaluation. Now let's take a closer look at North America. North America delivered EBIT adjusted of the $3 billion, up $200 million year-over-year, and 10.8% margin driven by our heavy-duty truck performance, our crossover performance and the benefits from our cost actions. This was partially offset by the impact of this strike, warranty costs and lower pension and health. Our newly launched heavy-duty trucks contributed favorably to volume, mix and price during the quarter. Market share for our large pickup trucks continues to improve, up 5 percentage points in Q3 year-over-year. We started deliveries of our heavy duties in Q2 and we have gained 6 percentage points in market share since the launch. Our light duty pickup trucks improved 6.8% at retail in Q3 year-over-year to over 40% as we rolled out diesel and other cab variants. We will have the same launch gate and strategy for the heavy-duty as we did for the light duty with the rollout of double cabs next, followed by regular cab. Switching to crossovers, U.S. deliveries grew 29% year-over-year with a Chevrolet Blazer and Cadillac XT6 providing strong contributions to our results. Let\u2019s move to GM International. For the third quarter, EBITDA adjusted in GMI was down $200 million year-over-year driven by lower equity income in China. Continued industry weakness and pricing pressure resulted in Q3 equity income down $200 million year-over-year from record Q3, 2018 level. We did see slight benefits from improved mix partially due to our recently launch vehicle. A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise in our core segment, GM Financial posted record quarterly revenue of $3.7 billion in the third quarter and record EBT adjusted of $700 million primarily as a result of portfolio growth. Cruise costs were $300 million for the quarter on track with approximately $1 billion communicated previously for the full year as we increased our headcount. Core segment costs in the third year -- sorry third quarter were $500 million, unfavorable $400 million year-over-year primarily due to net loss of $280 million from Lyft and PSA investments in the third quarter of this year compared to a $170 million gain from our PSA investment in the third quarter of last year. We have made significant progress on our transformational cost savings initiative with $2.4 billion achieved since 2018. We\u2019re on track with our 2019 target of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, achieving $1.9 billion year-to-date and $800 million in the third quarter. Let me update you on our outlook for the calendar year. The recent strike is obviously had a negative impact on our financial performance in Q3 and more so in Q4. We estimate the calendar year EPS diluted adjusted impact to be approximately 4$2 per share and adjusted automotive free cash flow impact to be approximately $5.5 billion including the impact of working capital unwind. The $2 in EPS reflects lost production of a richer mix, lost after-market sales, start up and ramp cost, and is net of a higher U.S. tax rate on last earnings. While we continue to work on strike recovery efforts, we anticipate that we have small portion of the losses sustained during this strike can be recovered this year due to capacity constraints. Factoring in all of this, our updated 2019 EPS diluted adjusted outlook is in the range of $4.50 to $4.80. Catching on CapEx, we expect 2019 CapEx of approximately $7.5 billion this year due to timing and early achievement of commitment. Updating for this and the impact of the strike, we expect adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the range of zero to $1 billion. I would like to provide some additional perspective on this guidance. The underlying EPS and free cash flow guidance is consistent with the range given in January. We have experienced the highly unusual situation with the shutdown of our North American operations for six weeks. We are restarting our operations very close to year end and the speed of production ramp and timing factors are very difficult to predict at this point. We have provided the best estimated outlook given the information that we have today. Next, I want to briefly talk about the impact of our new labor agreement. The new agreement preserves our competitiveness, manufacturing flexibility, and balance sheet strength without compromising earnings power. We have maintained the mix of our North American manufacturing footprint, maintained ability to adjust our work force in response to changing industry levels, protected the balance sheet with no increase to define benefit pension obligation and no payments or increase obligations to retirees. We maintained breakeven levels in the 10 million to 11 million unit range in the U.S. and therefore preserved our ability to navigate through a downturn. It is important to note that while this labor agreement is inflationary, we expect to offset incremental economics over the contract period with productivity initiative. Finally, I want to briefly touch on 2020. While we will provide full guidance in February, let me help frame the year by outlining a number of puts and takes. Headwinds for 2020 include likely lower industry volume, downtime and ramp up for the launch of our full-size SUVs, higher depreciation and continued volatility in China and in South America. Opportunities in 2020 include full year of heavy-duty truck production, transformational cost savings, and product launches including the Corvette, Encore GX, Trailblazer and our global family of vehicles. The ability to recover loss production during the strike in 2020 will depend on industry performance and our capacity availability as we already run our full size truck plans at maximum three ships capacity. Lastly, as a result of our decision to invest in our Detroit-Hamtramck plant, we will incur operating costs that were outside the scope of our original transformation plan. While this slightly revises are year-end cost savings target to $4 billion to $4.5 billion, we will work to find every opportunity to maximize the cost savings potential. We're committed to our capital plan of approximately 7 billion annually, and our long-term financial trajectory, including 10% core EBIT adjusted margin, and improving our free cash flow conversion. In summary, the underlying business remains strong, and our guidance is consistent with the range given in January, excluding the impact of the strike. We have a labor agreement that preserves our competitiveness and flexibility and we expect to offset economics over the contract period with productivity. The environment is more challenging than just a few months ago, but the entire team is focused on our execution, both over the short and long-term. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Just to start on maybe some of the cash flow dynamics you mentioned, the CapEx lowered this year. That was on part on timing and then early achievement. Can you -- can we get some color on each factor? I guess I probably want to gauge how much of the timing could impact 2020 on free cash flow. I know you said, on average, $7 billion per year, but it seems like maybe 2020 might be a little bit higher than that. And then also related to free cash, with the working capital unwind in the fourth quarter, how much do we expect to recover into 2020? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, Joe, I would say from a CapEx standpoint, the early achievement of the CapEx commitments and 2019 does not impact our commitment to achieve $7 billion in 2020. So that commitment remains intact. From a timing perspective, even though we pull forward in 2019, we still think we can achieve that. To your question on free cash flow impact, obviously, there's the flow through from the profit impact into free cash flow. In addition to that, we've seen working capital and sales allowance and policy and warranty and so on timing items are driving the remaining amount there. So, the 5.5 comprises of the lost profit and the working capital unwind. CapEx remains intact, and that's the map to get to the 5.5. Joseph Spak : Okay, and then I know that you said recovery a volume next year is dependent on the market and as you noted, you're running all out on the trucks. But if we assume an environment in 2020, similar to '19, like just back in the envelope, I was sort of just looking at the calendar and counting days and make some assumptions. It seems like you might be able to get back 50% to 60% of it, is that reasonable? Dhivya Suryadevara : I think it's really hard to call that now, Joe, partially because you also need to figure out what the trucking industry is going to be like i.e. the segment share within the industry. And to your point, we are running those all out. It's difficult to add over time and travel overtime. So, we will recover every unit that we possibly can. It's just difficult to predict now at this point, what that would look like. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : I had a couple questions. First, looks like the adjusted free cash flow with the adjustments you're making would have put this year's free cash flow at $5.5 billion to $6 billion, if it wasn't for the strike. And it appears that you've got another $1 billion to $1.5 billion of savings for next year. The original number was closer to $2 billion and it sounds like the variants there was Hamtramck. So, what's evolved in your thinking on Hamtramck since earlier in the year? Mary Barra : So when we made the transformation announcement last year, although we had a battery electric truck in our plan. As we continue to evolve that and looked at the full range of what we can do there to really maintain our truck leadership position and grow that into battery electric trucks. We look at Detroit-Hamtramck is a great opportunity and company now getting an appropriate labor agreement there. And so, we think this is a good investment in positions as well to lead in battery electric trucks as well as internal combustion trucks. And so that is that portfolio as we further planted, it became clear that we can be more efficient doing that work there. Rod Lache : North America and GM Financial look like they were very strong this quarter. Obviously, there's unusual items that affects both of those right now. Could you just talk a little bit about those, aside from just the things like launch, but did you make any adjustments to pre existing warranties in North America? And how should we be thinking about the cadence for GM Financial going forward and what that might, may mean for releasing cash from that business? Dhivya Suryadevara : From a North American standpoint, yes, it was a very strong quarter. The cadence of our heavy-duty lunch helped a lot from a mix 10 points since we're rolling out, crew cab for the most part. And that will normalize as we roll out the other variants as well. To your question on no warranty, we had a $700 million year-over-year unfavorable and that was primarily driven by the K2 warranty cost that Mary mentioned in her remarks as well as there was a onetime favorable item in 2018 of last year which does not repeat in 2019. So, from a year-over-year Delta perspective, that impacts as well. And in Q3, I'd say rather that we go through a normal tour process from a warranty perspective and there were some top ups relative to that as well, but that was on the smaller side of things, that you capture that. From a GM Financial perspective, the biggest item I'd point to is the fact that residual values have been coming in stronger than what we had previously accounted for. So as you go forward there you may want to think about some kind of normalization there. The offset to that would be continued growth in the size of the book as we move closer towards forecast. Those are the normalizing items from GM Financial perspective. Joseph Spak : And just to clarify in North America, I was asking about the incentive accruals yet over 700,000 units of inventory, and I would have presume that you have make some adjustments just given that prospects for declining inventory. Was there anything unusual there? And can you tell us what\u2019s expectation is for Q4 production at this point? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I\u2019d say nothing specifically on the incentive side, we\u2019ll obviously \u2013 it will be vehicle-by-vehicle driven by market dynamics and nothing specifically to point out there from a true or whatever perspective. From a Q4 production, we are now back up and running and all of our plans are running all out. Like we said, we\u2019re going to take the opportunity to get any excellent that we can and that\u2019s all we can comment on at this time. And since we\u2019re still in ramp up and we\u2019re trying to maximize the number of units, we\u2019ll have more to share about that when we report Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : First question just around the labor agreement and the special attrition buyout program. It looks like it's only targeting about 2,000 workers, but based on sort of what I\u2019ve been able to dig up, it seems like half of your workers are senor, meaning they're getting defined benefit, pensions and natural attrition on an annual basis is about 2,000 workers. So just curious why that even the special attrition program that buyout might not target more workers? And then overtime in the next three years before the next contract, would that impact sort of natural attrition, meaning would be still expect to see 2000 per year? So first is why is it a larger program? And second, what kind of impact would it have on natural attrition overtime? Mary Barra : I think a couple of things here to think about it. First of all, one big component of the special attrition program was to give people choices. Although, we have job for everybody that was impacting by the un-allocation of three plans, we wanted to give them options and so there is a target there from that perspective. And the other thing is, you can -- we think that again people wait and look and see if there is going to special attrition program, but then we also do see the natural attrition over the course of the agreement. So, I would expect that to continue and that\u2019s how we size what we thought the SAP should be. John Murphy : And Mary, when we think about those attritions whether it'd be special or sort of natural over the next few years, what is your plan as far as back feeling for those workers? I mean, would there be replaced one-for-one with in-progression workers or entry level workers? Or could there be folks then get hired out in California to work on cruise? Just trying to understand sort of the thought process of what, how to size the labor for us going forward? Mary Barra : Well, I think it's a -- there is many different components of the labor force. There is a Cruise labor force. There is our salary workforce and then there is our representative workforce. And I think your question is directed as the represented work force, we\u2019re going to continue to work on productivity and we have opportunity there. We also have a lot of opportunity continue to improve our manufacturing processes. We\u2019ve done a lot of work this year and complexity optimization, and we\u2019re driving that in from a design for manufacture ability perspective into how we design vehicles. We\u2019ve also been able to find more and more opportunities to reuse without impacting our customers view of vehicle is being all-new especially when you look at some of the architectural components. We also have a program we've been working on for many years call built-in quality level 4. And by the end of the year, virtually all of our plants will have achieved built-in quality 4. Our built-in quality level 4, which leads to first better health and safety and better quality as measured by two months and 12 months warranty performance. So, we see, I'll say traditional productivity improvements. We see efficiencies on how we designed vehicles and components from the DFMEA perspective. And then, we see the results coming from our built-in quality level 4. All those things are going to help us make sure we optimize the workforce and optimize our manufacturing costs. As we need to hire additional workers, we\u2019ll utilize both temps and I'm very proud of the fact that we provided an appropriate path to permanent employment for our temporary workforce and then also maintain the in-progression flow. So, we'll utilize both of those depending on the plan and the situation at that plant. John Murphy : Got you, that's helpful. Then just on the SUV launch. Is there any change in timing for next year on the SUV launch given what's happened with the strike? Mary Barra : We haven't specifically said when those launches they will occur and will roll out all three versions next year. And of course, the team is working to do everything possible to make sure we have successful high quality launches with minimizing the impact of the acceleration curve. So those we still we'll get all those done this year and I'm not going to give any more specifics on timing. John Murphy : Okay. And then just lastly, there's been a lot of negative comments on pricing, and some came from one of your cross-town rivals but also sort of in the press. Yet the quarter, on your majors, you put up a $400 million positive, but more importantly you put up a $200 million positive on your carryovers. What do you see in the pricing sort of competitive landscape for pricing? I mean, is that $200 million positive from carryovers was that benefited by some shortages during the strike or you actually seeing some real net positive price on carryovers? Dhivya Suryadevara : From a majors perspective, I'd say it's mainly driven by our heavy-duty and the variance of the light duty, that we\u2019ve recently launched. So those were strong, and that's really the truck franchise that\u2019s driving that. On the carryover side, the outgoing model from a car perspective, we reduced our incentives on that quite a bit. From a crossover standpoint, we were disciplined as well. So overall, I would say positive, carryover a net price. That's going to be quarter-to-quarter John, it's going to vary based on seasonality and so on and so forth. But it's our intention, stay disciplined. And as you can see in the quarter, with the net majors mechanisms that I just talked about, we have grown share for both light duties as well as heavy duties. We plan on continuing on that path of being disciplined. John Murphy : And Dhivya, in a competitive environment, have you seen any deterioration there? I mean, I understand you guys are pretty disciplined, but I mean, are you seeing sort of any kind of warning signs out there? Dhivya Suryadevara : I think there's definitely months where you see some competitive activity and then it normalizes and so on, but we're launching, we're going with our cadence. And we're, the strength of the products that we put out are driving our market share gains this time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : So just first question with inventory now being leaner, can you talk about opportunities you might have in Q4 and beyond to optimize for mix and pricing? Should we expect mix to get richer over the next several months as you try to kind of manage the inventory situation? Dhivya Suryadevara : We're going to try and build everything that we can get Itay from a mix perspective. We will continue down the path of rolling out the richer mix from an HD standpoint. LD as low, we will, try and maximize it will make sense that our most profitable and as we go forward. So we're going to be opportunistic as we go along. And the other aspect is, obviously, from a country mix standpoint, there's places where we, there's places that are more profitable and there are places that are less profitable, and we're going to direct the amount of inventory that we have towards the more profitable places as well. So, we will be opportunistic, it's hard to obviously sites that at this time, and we will provide more detail in Q4. Itay Michaeli : And just second Dhivya, on the 2020 puts and takes I think you mentioned lower industry volume as a headwind. Can you put the more detail what you thinking regionally and globally? Does that include the truck franchise, pickup truck industry and sales there still do not be strong throughout 2019. Any additional color would be helpful there. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I think we still have another couple of months here to go to see what happens here. But in 2020, we do think that China will remain volatile. South America will remain volatile. And here the United States with the economic growth are moderating here in the recent past and in the next year or so we're anticipating. We're still planning for a lower industry, so healthy industry but a lower industry in 2020. And we're going to have to, as we move forward here in the next few months before we get guidance, we'll put more specifically around that but any more than that it's too early to tell. Itay Michaeli : But just lastly on Cruise, I think back in July, Cruise mentioned they would accelerate testing and validation in the balance of 2019. Any update that you can share in terms of miles driven and the overall activity that Cruise is undergoing in the second half? Mary Barra : I would say we're not going to give you a specific mileage, but they are doing exactly what they indicated, they would do in the summer timeframe. Everything's going really well, as they need their milestones and as they continue to develop the economist technology. So very much on track and not only on the technology, but also the work that they're doing in San Francisco in the community to make sure that the consumer is ready understands the technology and trust the technology. So, both of those plans are perfectly on track. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Mary, over the next five years, will GM spend more R&D and CapEx dollars on EVs or internal combustion vehicles? Mary Barra : I believe it'll be EV. Adam Jonas : Thank you. And do you think that do EV is require less labor then internal combustion vehicles, all else equal? Mary Barra : I mean I think you have to look at the entire vehicle. Clearly from an electrification perspective, it's simpler from a component perspective than it is from an internal combustion engine. But you know what the key things that we've done is light-weighting because light-weighting is so important across every component and from a body structures perspective, that light weighting generally requires a little bit more labor. So, overall, I think it's somewhat last but I think you've got to look at the whole vehicle, not just the propulsion system. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. And just, I wanted to have a couple questions on Corvette. And I Mark is not on the call here. So, maybe we can follow up with him. But Mary, what do you think of a Corvette SUV? Mary Barra : I appreciate that you think our core franchise is very strong. I\u2019m not going to talk about future\u2026 Adam Jonas : I do. Mary Barra : Thank you, I can\u2019t wait for the world to be able to drive the CA because its\u2019 an outstanding vehicle and the value, the performance is I think just set the new bar and then the affordability I think is something we\u2019re really proud of and is very true to the Chevrolet brand. So I will just share with you we look at a variety of things as we move forward, but we recognize the strength of the core brands right now we\u2019re focusing and getting the CA out and then the other variants including the convertible. So, very excited about that product and what it will for us. Adam Jonas : I appreciate it. Then I won\u2019t ask about electric core that either right now, we can say that for later. Finally then just you mentioned on China, I think when you were talking about 2020 expect that China that we\u2019re headwind. Can you elaborate a little bit more there on what was the market, what was the volume assumption or mix or price assumption within that, any other color on the China headwind, if I got that correctly for 2020 versus 2019? Thanks everybody. Mary Barra : Yes. Adam, I think it\u2019s early to call it, I mean there is so much going on right now as you look at the volatility in China, look at where we\u2019re still in the middle of where we\u2019re trying to understand where the trades stocks are going to land and how that\u2019s going to impact the overall economy. So, we are seeing a vital environment and we\u2019re also seeing a lot of pricing pressures. And then as we look forward as we rollout more EVs, initially we\u2019re going to see some margin headwind there. So, I think when you look at all those things in 2020, we\u2019ll have more color for that as we do that February earnings call for Q4, but those are the things that we\u2019re seeing right now that we think we\u2019ll carry into 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Could you provide an update in terms of the impact of the new labor accord on your downturn resiliency in North America? Can you remind us of your latest estimate of North America breakeven expressed in terms of U.S. light vehicle SAR and whether the contract changes that breakeven while? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. Ryan, what we\u2019ve previously talked about is the breakeven level of 10 million to 11 million units for the U.S. This contact will not change that and how wide that is, is basically the comment that Mary made about productivity and other efficiencies offsetting the economics of the contract will certainly blame to that. In addition to that from a flexibility standpoint what we\u2019ve model in our downturn assumption is the ability to adjust the level of workforce based on what\u2019s happening in the industry. And a certain levels of supplement unemployment benefits to go with that and that just not change based on this contract which is primarily the driver the maintaining the downturn assumption of where they are. Ryan Brinkman : And I was encouraged in the release that you attributed the software banned industry sales in China to demand, to lower demand for your outgoing products. Could you please provide us an update on the income and products in China like earlier in the year you were relatively optimistic about the sales and prospect potential from new launches including the first office, I think so called GEM Architecture. Can you talk about how the sales and cost of the launch vehicles has extended relative to your expectation in China? And then finally it would be great if you could update us with regards to the extent which you have or have not detected any perceived bias against U.S. based brands and the aftermath trade or other attentions in that market? Dhivya Suryadevara : Sure, sure. And Ryan first of all, we haven\u2019t really seeing and we monitored that we really haven\u2019t seen any negative settlement. So we think that\u2019s very positive. And we are in the middle of the launches for the year. We had 11 majors including the Buick, which is a battery electric vehicle, the Buick Encore, Buick Encore GX, the Chevrolet Onix, the Chevrolet Trailblazer, and Tracker and then the Cadillac XT6 and then some Baojun products as well. And then, there were several very important MCMs with across Buick [indiscernible] as well as the Chevrolet Monza and the Cadillac XT5. So I think as you look at all of those vehicles into a market with the uncertainty and the economic issues or the macro issues in China, and say they're all on track, you were correct to note that we did have our first of Chevrolet Onix, which is the global family. It's one of many launches in China and it is on track. However, we did mentioned in my remarks that it is doing exceptionally well in South America because it's at the heart of the market and the biggest segment. So, I think we need to see these vehicles get into the marketplace. And I think a lot we'll see as we get into next year as well, but the launches are on track. I do think, though, and some of them, as we did see a more significant drop off than we thought we would with the outgoing vehicle. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, hi, good morning. This is Steven [indiscernible] on for Brian Johnson. Just wanted to drill that down on the potential recoup, some of the loss production took on the T1 pickup truck side in the 2020. I guess assuming kind of an overall stable large pickup market into 2020. Is it fair to say that GM is already running at max capacity? And that's from a production schedule standpoint tentatively, as you think about 2020 is really no pretension that make up that loss production, especially if we get upside with large pick up market? Or is there any kind of scope so we can work as we think through 4Q and into 2020? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I would say that your assumption is correct in an industry level and a truck penetration level that similar to what we have today, where we already have scheduled, we can time and a lot of other overtime. On a regular basis, we have these plans working max overtime. So, the ability to add additional days is limited. We will obviously try and find any voluntary opportunities to do overtime beyond that, but it's not something I would call my baseline at this point. Unidentified Analyst : Understood, thanks for the clarification. And then in terms of the revised UAW contract impact, we outside in kind of got you about $115 million gross labor inflationary impact in 2020 ramping up to about 350 in 2023. Just wondering, if that's kind of ballpark correct, and then also can you quantify the buckets of the dollar savings offsets some attrition buyouts absenteeism and other productivity initiatives? Mary Barra : Yes, yes, I think we -- given I said more broadly is that we really believe the inclinatory elements of the contracts or the economics that we can offset with productivity and there is plans well established. We don't know yet exactly how the special attrition program is going to play out. People have till the end of the year and find out for that. So I think what you here from us though as a team that is committed to finding the right offsets to go forward and maintain and improve our competiveness. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, just in terms of the gross inflationary labor cost in fact was that, is that ballpark directionally correct in terms of $100 million in 2020 ramping up 350 in 2023? Mary Barra : Well, I mean, I think if you look at that, there's some parts of the contract, they're easy to do the math on. And but I think there's others that, we will look to see how it plays out. And some of that depends on the workforce, depend on how many people take the special attrition program, depends on the industry as we go forward, so I'm not going to put projections that far out. Unidentified Analyst : And then, just a last clarification question. In terms of the revised transformational restructuring savings, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion, does that include the productivity initiatives you've outlined? Or would that potentially provide some upside to get back to the original target of $4.5 billion? Mary Barra : I think first we're going to work to offset and then we're going to keep going, we won't stop when we get there. So I think over time, there's upside, especially, and the broader elements we've talked about how we continue to improve, how we design vehicles that affect the demand, your manufacturing costs and our ability to continue to build quality institution and improve our quality system. So all those things are going to contribute and although we revived it based on the decision we made, largely related to Detroit-Hamtramck. We're going to continue to push the organization to continue to find cost opportunities. And I would say that's the goal we set for the end of 2020. It's not like after that we stop. At that point, we'll evaluate the business and look for the next round of cost savings that we can drive into the business and commit to from an improving shareholder value perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Just wanted to follow up on the question on this productivity gains. Could you give us some color on what initiatives you might be able to pursue or timing? And more specifically, you've obviously been pretty successful with cost saves in the past. I think probably one of the reasons why your earnings level has been rather elevated. Just wondering how much the low hanging fruit may already be exhausted. And you're going to have to dig in a little harder and it's not going to be as easy to some of these gains? Mary Barra : Well, I think, when we look at our comparison that Harbour or I guess, if Oliver Wyman does from productivity. We still have opportunities to improve. And it's not just, minutes per hour of and the way we design a job, it's much broader than that. And I think we have a lot of opportunities to tap into as we really optimize our complexity and we leverage reuse. And so, those are things that I'm very pleased that the organization has taken to a new level this year, and that will play out over multiple years because a lot of it is if you design the vehicle for design for manufacturer ability, doing that now will play out in years, when we actually launched the vehicle be it two, three, four years from now. And don't underestimate the work that we've been doing on built-in quality level four, because for the plants that are already there, we definitely see just the fact that more vehicles are built in station means they spend, no time and repair. And that's that savings as well. So I believe, although I'm very proud of the manufacturing team of what they've already accomplished, and working across with the engineering organization, I think there's still much more to tap into and that's what we do. Dan Levy : And then just as a second question, one that's more existential and sort of touching on one of the prior questions. Obviously, one of your publically stated goals, zero emissions future and that's probably requires a smaller footprint and what you have in place today. So first of all, does this current agreement have any limitations on specifying limitations on what you can build for EVs? And then just more broadly with your zero mission future roll, how aligned is your labor partner with you on this goal? Will they ever service partners with you along this transition. Sort of similar to what we see in Europe and Germany to addressing or future or is there interest simply look this is a four year agreement and once it expires than we\u2019ll deal with the future as it comes? Mary Barra : Well, I think in this Europe agreement we are dealing with the future, if we look at from an EB perspective we already build the Chevrolet Bolt EV in our Orion plant in Michigan, very significant discussions that we had as it relates to the battery electric truck with our UAW as it relates to what we\u2019re going to do to tracking and trading. So, I think what we\u2019re trying to do is, and first of all, there is no limitation. So I want to make that very, very clear, but we are committed to the United States and committed to manufacturing in the United States. We see a huge opportunity adding electrification and that's why we\u2019re investing and I think in among the leaders in the EV space. I think we are technology roadmaps that we have for sale development, we\u2019re going to well position that and with the equipments we\u2019ve made for the better are next generation or architecture which we call the BEV3. So, this was all part of the discussions and I think as signifies but what we\u2019re doing in Orion and what we\u2019ll be doing into Detroit-Hamtramck. Dan Levy : I guess more specifically you have other engine and transmission plans out there that presumably in an EV world are deemed unnecessary. Has there been any sort of discussions with the union in the future on how to deal with these plans that could potentially beyond necessary? Mary Barra : Yes. I think that\u2019s over a very long horizon. We still see, you know, even when you look at the multitude of projections by 2030, is it 15%, is it 30% all in, that means the bells of the vehicles being sold in the country into rail combustion engine vehicles. We\u2019re well position because we\u2019ve renewed all those architectures and we\u2019ve invested in very efficient instead of combustion engine technology that will continue to improve. So, I think this is going to play out over a number of years and there are components in the drive unit from an EV perspective that needs to be build somewhere. So, I think we\u2019re looking to do the right thing from a company perspective to drive shareholder value to leading EVs and do the right things for our manufacturing footprint and for our employees. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : I was hoping you can provide a little bit more color on your underlying performance this year excluding the strike to the extent that's possible? Your, the revised guidance just and then you add backs sort of this strike impact seems to be fix it 60 to 80 maybe the lower end of to reflect original guidance. Is there anything? Are there any like specific factors that you see that are playing that maybe on the softer end of what you have expected before? I mean again, excluding strike, is it at the international? Or is it China? Is there anything you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. that would account for that? And as part of that question also just trying to understand better the tax rate impact, the new guidance is at the lower tax rate, is that correct? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. So, number of questions there, so let me address them one-by-one. The new guidance $4.50 to $4.80, you\u2019re correct, we've subtracted the $2 and arrived at, so it\u2019s the original guidance we gave in January less $2 on the upper end we clipped it by $0.20 as you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve -- its\u2019 been quite a volatile environment in China as well as the microeconomic of volatility we\u2019re seeing in South America as well the FX environment that we saw earlier in the year, when we gave our guidance was very different from the FX picture that we have today, which is offsetting some of that as well. So I would say that the weakness is predominantly more on the international front, the volatility that we're seeing. And from a North America perspective as it seeing the performance quarter after quarter, it continues to be strong. From a just from the tax rate perspective, the revised rate is primarily because the strike impact is you got to apply the U.S. tax rate to that strike impact, which is about 25% effective tax rate, that we're applying there. So if you take our original tax guidance, subtract out the higher tax rate that's applicable on our strike impact, you get to your UN revised tax guidance. So it's consistent. It's just that you're applying a different tax rate than the weighted average tax rate on the strike impact. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that's great color. And then just I was hoping can you give a little bit more color on the puts and takes for 2020. And in particular, a few discrete items, you're talking about downtime and ramp up for the full size SUV, anything you're able to quantify in terms of specifically in the downtime there? And then you did not mention raw materials as a potential tailwind, I was curious if you can give an update on what is represent this year and then how to think about it for next year? And then the sort of discrete items would be warranty, obviously a fairly big charge which you explained, for the quarter. Does that have a carryover impact as we move into next year? Dhivya Suryadevara : So, on the 2020 side, the puts and takes that I gave predominantly, a lot of industry uncertainty around the globe, that's what I would characterize as a primary headwind. From a downtime standpoint, this is a complicated SUV full size SUV launch. There's a significant amount of change that's happening from the current generation to the next generation. So from a downtime perspective as well as more importantly, the line rate ramp up post the downtime, we're anticipating an additional headwind year-over-year, for full size SUVs. I don't want to quantify that now since we're still working on how we can optimize the number of units that we're going to be able to put out in 2020. So I will quantify that further in February. But it is safe to assume that there will be a year-over-year headwind from a full size SUV perspective. There will also be higher depreciation. That's something has been consistent with in the past several quarters as our depreciation caches up to our CapEx level and we've been seeing a secular increase every single year. And that's going to continue into 2020 as well. And obviously this is non-cash, if you will know. From a raw material and tariff perspective to your point, I said this before in prior quarters, there's puts and takes, it's hard to look at just one number and paint it all with the same brush. But steel and aluminum we have seen tailwinds offset by precious metals, tariff as well as fuel costs, which impacts our logistic spend. And so net-net, we are still at 500 million year-over-year headwind from a 2019 standpoint, we don't see that moderating, necessarily into 2020, since the headwinds that I mentioned are likely to continue into 2020. And it's obviously hard to predict the tariff environment that we're going to be in. So that's generally the headwind, tailwinds the remaining cost saving so far, we've achieved close to $2.4 billion of cost savings and the remaining cost savings are going to be realized over a period of time, according to our revised guidance. You're going to have a full year of heavy-duty trucks and the product launches that I talked about. Hopefully this gives you some color. And finally on the warranty question that you had, we do see that a specific to Q3 of this year, I don't see a tail event into 2020 on that. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : Just wanted to jump in on maybe the impact from a working capital standpoint on the change and the free cash flow guide? So just really quick of the 5.5, it looks like 2.8 was worse than just the operations. You back out the CapEx, it looks like something like a $3.5 billion or $4 billion drain on working capital. Can you just confirm that it was all working capital and there's not any other sort of one time drivers for the cash flow because we're trying to think about the reversal next year? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I would say that your EBIT impact seems to be on the low end maybe you're talking about the net income impact so from an EBIT prospective set up for, you going to talk about growth number there. That, plus the working capital unwind, constitutes most of the 5.5. There's no other like one time item or whatever else that's out there but the profit impact that you talked about us that sounds a little understated but it's potentially because of tax rate. Chris McNally : And then if we could talk about the without giving numbers like when we think about the reversal at some time in the first half. I know you want to give guidance, but could you just sort of walk through the timing of how that would play out from an inventory standpoint? Dhivya Suryadevara : Are you talking about the reversal of working capital or the recovery of profits or both? Chris McNally : The reversal of working capital? Dhivya Suryadevara : So, reversal of working capital, we think that the low point is probably going to be sometime in November, as we cycle to the rest of the unwind, and payables and receivables will start back up 15 days after we start shipping, that cadence will continue. So we do anticipate that you think part of the recovery in the second half of November and into the December. And Q1, as you know, it tends to be a negative cash quarter because of our shutdown and the reversal after that. But what you would see from a cash balance standpoint is that recovery starting in the second quarter of next year, into the rest of 2020. Chris McNally : That's perfect on the timing. And then maybe this is more of like a from a communication standpoint. I mean 2020 was already supposed to be sort of a better free cash flow year. I think we asked that question a couple of different times on the call. But you're already getting improvement of CapEx the reduction attention from a cash flow and income statement and then the FinCo dividend. If we get this working capital benefit in 2020, is it the type of thing that you will actually be able to call out, so that we can start to understand what is the true because working capital wasn't one of the working, one of the benefits that we were expecting in 2020 and 2021, which likely will now be sort of core operation? So is that something that you could fact out for the street as we go into 2020 and 2021? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, we will be very clear about how much of our 2020 free cash flow guidance comes from the working capital rewind and we will also be clear about how much of the cash based earnings i.e., the operating cash flow if you will and what that is year-over-year. So from a communication standpoint we\u2019re certainly be clear about that and beyond that you\u2019re right we don\u2019t want to take much more about magnitude of that until February. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Thank you very much and thanks everybody for participating this morning. If you look for several years, the team at General Motors has been making tough decision to make our business more resilient and more agile. This discipline will help us overcome the impact of this strike we continue launching our heavy-duty trucks, the new Cadillac sedan. And as we move forward, the upcoming launches such as mid engine Corvette and the next generation of full-size SUVs. This leadership team has a proven track record of successfully navigating complex business issues, confronting headwinds and capitalizing on opportunity. And I believe we have the best employees in the industry across the board. They want to work and they come to work every day to do their best. And they want General Motors to succeed and they want to be a part of that successful future. So as we move forward together, we\u2019re going to continue to build on the strong foundation we\u2019ve laid and share and allow them to share on the future success of the Company. But let me be clear, we\u2019re also working hard to lead in both the core and EV and AV world and creates significant shareholder value. And before I close, I want to let you know that we will host our Capital Markets Day in New York on February 5th, 2020. This year in addition to providing our 2020 outlook, it will include our Q4 and our full year 2019 earnings results. And we\u2019ll share additional details about the Capital Markets Day in the near future. So thanks everybody very much. I appreciate your time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Rocky Gupta : Good morning. Thanks for being here. So welcome to the 2020 General Motors Capital Markets Day. Our press release, presentation and earnings material are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We\u2019re also broadcasting today\u2019s event via webcast. Before we begin, I need to take care of a couple of housekeeping items. First, safety is a top priority for us at GM so please take a moment to look at the two exit doors so in the unlikely event of an emergency, you can access them quickly.Second, note our forward-looking statements. All the discussion today, including the Q&A, will be governed by this language. It\u2019s going to be an exciting day so let\u2019s get started. Mary Barra : Well, welcome, everybody. I\u2019m really excited to have this opportunity to share General Motors\u2019 story today. The video you just saw captures our energy, our passion and our confidence as we transform the company and create a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. This vision drives every team member every day. And we are really enthusiastic about the opportunity we have created to refine the future, redefine the future of personal transportation and all the possibilities that come with it.Here\u2019s a brief overview of what we\u2019ll cover today. Mark will start and provide an update on the reinvention of the Global Product Development organization. He will also showcase some of our dramatic new launches, including Cadillac and the Escalade that was revealed last evening, and he\u2019ll give us a preview of our electric vehicle strategy.Barry will cover our truck and full-sized SUV franchise and our 2020 launches as we\u2019re very excited to launch at the full-size SUVs from Chevrolet from GMC and from Cadillac. And Matt, President of our China operation, will cover his update and perspectives on the continuing and evolving macroeconomic situation in China as well as the measures General Motors China is taking to address them and the strong foundation we have and intend to build on because we see a long-term opportunity in China.Now Matt arrived in the States late last week and out of an abundance of caution, he will actually \u2013 we have taped his remarks and we will show those to you and he will dial-in for the actual Q&A session. Steve Kiefer, who newly took over our GMI region, will talk about our team\u2019s plan to improve performance in our GM international markets and give an update on the early days launch of our global family of vehicles product, the GEM product we\u2019ve talked about.And then Dan Ammann is here, CEO of Cruise, and he\u2019s going to provide an update on Cruise. He\u2019ll talk a little about the news that we shared earlier this month with our \u2013 or actually, last month, with the Cruise Origin, and then also provide a framework for how we\u2019re thinking about commercialization and how that translates into revenue and profitability.We\u2019ll then take a break for lunch, and Dhivya will come up and she\u2019s going to review the progress toward our key financial metrics. She\u2019ll review 2019 performance and she\u2019ll also provide an outlook for 2020. She\u2019s also going to share and really hope you see \u2013 provide a unique \u2013 the unique positioning that General Motors has with our cash-generating franchises and also our accretive growth opportunities, especially in EV but in other areas as well.And because our fourth quarter earnings were announced today and we have our Capital Markets Day today, we will have one Q&A session and address all your questions there. Our goal today is to leave you with a clear understanding of our vision and our strategy for the future and how we\u2019re operating the business. And we hope that you believe, as we do, that General Motors is uniquely positioned with all the elements to take the industry forward.Now let me pause before we go into the content of Capital Markets Day and talk about the coronavirus. Our thoughts and our focus has been on our people and then on the business, and our thoughts go out to everyone who has been impacted by the virus. We are working closely with SAIC, our joint venture partner, as the situation is very fluid. We\u2019re focused on the health and safety of our employees, and we are taking all necessary steps to make sure they have full support and urgent access to any medical support they may need.Our supply chain and engineering teams are working around the clock to develop and execute contingency plans, and we are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact of the virus. Again, it\u2019s a very fluid situation. As we learn more, we will provide updates. So now if we move back to the Capital Markets Day, let\u2019s go back to last year\u2019s Capital Markets Day.There, we had recently made announcements for \u2013 and shared the major business transformation in November of the year prior, a transformation that was designed to strengthen our business. The cost savings from that transformation helped us mitigate the effects in 2019 of an increasingly volatile global business environment, including reduced volumes in two of our \u2013 our two largest markets, China and the United States, as well as the work stoppage in the United States.The team has been working hard to restore lost production while ensuring our inventory is aligned to market demand, and Dhivya will speak on how we continue to not only realize the savings from the transformation but also how we\u2019re looking at production and the ability to recover. In addition, as part of our transformation though, we were working to realign the workforce and our resources with our strategic priorities for the future.We have streamlined our vehicle portfolio to recognize customers\u2019 overwhelming preference for SUVs, for trucks and for crossovers. We are also investing heavily in the technology and innovation that will help us realize our vision. I truly believe that 2020 is the year when all of our work comes together and we move forward with integrated solutions that will be the groundwork for reinventing how we deliver mobility to our customers. There are \u2013 there\u2019s ample evidence today that our customers are increasingly buying products and services from companies and brands they identify as improving their lives and improving the sustainability of the planet. They want companies to integrate environmental stewardship and sustainability into every aspect of the business.And it\u2019s a business imperative because it\u2019s a priority for our customers. It\u2019s also a priority for our employees, and it\u2019s a priority for you, many of our investors and we believe the right thing to do. As we compete for the best talent, our employees or our prospective employees are telling us, they want to work for a company that does the right thing, that shares their values and supports their desire to make the world a better place, all of that in addition to making sure that it\u2019s a rewarding career opportunity and there\u2019s growth potential.Now our belief in the science of climate change drives our commitment to create a zero emissions future. So while you\u2019ll hear a lot today about our vision and the progress we are making to achieve it, we know we have more work to do today to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and of our products. There is excellent work going on across the company, and we are integrating and accelerating that work because we believe it\u2019s critical to the future, and we believe we have a responsibility to aggressively pursue it.So we are establishing a new set of key goals, and today, we are publicly committing to meet even more ambitious targets as we move forward. We will source 100% of our global electricity from renewables by 2040. This is a full decade ahead of the commitment we had previously made. Now we finished 2019 with 23 sites completely powered by renewable energy.By the end of 2021, we\u2019ll grow that to more than 28 sites, including our Global Tech Center and the Renaissance Center where our headquarters is at. By 2030, we \u2013 all of our U.S. facilities will be 100% powered by renewable energy, and by 2025, we expect 60% \u2013 to be 60% of the way toward our 100% goal from a global perspective. And while the issue of doing \u2013 what to do with end-of-life batteries is a subject of much debate and concern, GM has been very proactive on this front. GM already enables 100% reuse or recycling of our batteries, and we will continue to engineer our EV batteries for full reuse or recyclability, and we believe they have long-term value and therefore are an asset.In partnership with our suppliers, we will also increase the percentage of automotive parts with sustainable material content. We\u2019ve established sustainable material target of at least 50% by 2030 for all of our vehicles. And by mass, we already enabled more than 85% reuse or recycling of our current vehicles at the end of their life. And by increasing the sustainable content, we think we\u2019ll get even closer to achieving a circular economy.To accomplish these goals and develop a more aligned and holistic plan, we have recently named Dane Parker to be our Chief Sustainability Officer and to lead our sustainability office. And this is a team that will work cross-functionally to one, ensure responsible consumption and production of materials; to lead the strategic design and implementation of our EV infrastructure; and also engage internal and external stakeholders to achieve our vision of a zero emission future.We\u2019ll continue to advocate for policies that are aligned with our vision. Because we believe climate change is real, it\u2019s a global concern and the best way to remove automotive ambitions from the environmental equation is an all-electric zero emissions future, and it needs to be done on a national level and then a global level. We believe that the National Zero Emissions Vehicle program that we have proposed across all 50 states will help accelerate the transition to EVs and all of the benefits that come to the environment and to society.It would also position the United States as a leader in electrification. It would create economic growth and make EVs more affordable for more customers more quickly. If we want true electrification across the country, which we do, we need the infrastructure, the education and the incentive programs to all align and work together. We strongly believe that focusing on interim technologies such as hybrids and multiple solutions for multiple states actually slows the adoption of full battery electric vehicles.Now my commitment and General Motors\u2019 commitment has always been that we\u2019re going to do the right thing even when it\u2019s hard, and I am more convinced than ever that we need one national standard on which all parties can respectfully agree and that will benefit all. We\u2019ve really frankly got to get past the politics and do what\u2019s right because we\u2019re talking about a fundamental shift in transportation as we know it.Now General Motors will continue to have conversations with both California and the federal government so we can speed EV adoption and be ready for customers with the electric vehicles they\u2019re looking for, whether it\u2019s a Chevrolet Bolt EV or a GMC HUMMER EV or frankly, anything in between. By taking these steps and pushing for real dialogue to resolve the underlying issues, we believe we can accelerate EV adoption and lessen the impact of our operations.But as we look today and as customers continue to choose crossovers, SUVs and trucks, we are also working to ensure these vehicles are as efficient as possible, using 3D printing, parts consolidation, improving aerodynamics and the use of lighter materials. For example, we have removed an average of 350 pounds from each architecture for our new vehicle launches. This has reduced carbon emissions by about 312 metric tons per year, and it demonstrates the strides towards zero emissions will also come from our traditional vehicle lineup.So while EVs and AVs are key elements in our vision, our work is already underway with our current product portfolio and pipeline. And let\u2019s talk about safety for a minute. Our active safety features are effective, proven technologies that our customers can buy today, and they are also an important step on the road to a world with zero crashes. Last year, General Motors partnered with the University of Michigan Transportation Institute to study the effectiveness of various GM safety-related features and the results were pretty dramatic.GM\u2019s Forward Automatic Braking with Forward Collision Alert delivered a 46% reduction in rear-end crashes. Our Rear Park Assist reduced backing crashes by 38%. And IntelliBeam headlamps were responsible for a 35% reduction in nighttime animal, pedestrian and bicycle crashes. And then when you look at these technologies and you combine them, combining technologies such as Reverse Automatic Braking with Rear Cross Traffic Alert, Rear Vision cameras and Rear Park Assist, there was an 81% reduction in backing crashes.So these are safety technologies that are preventing injuries, preventing property damage and the cost to our customers and society. In addition to the safety features I\u2019ve just talked about, we\u2019ve also expanded the footprint and the functionality of our exclusive Super Cruise driver assist technology. I\u2019m really excited about this technology because it\u2019s one of the most popular and promising technologies I\u2019ve seen in a long time. 85% of current CT owners and Super Cruise users tell us they would prefer or only consider a future vehicle with Super Cruise and that\u2019s a pretty powerful endorsement. Mark will have much more to share about this technology and our plans going forward.Now, let\u2019s talk about electrification. We\u2019ve made tremendous strides in our electrification journey in the four years since we revealed the Chevrolet Bolt EV. And this year and next, we are intensifying our work to bring our third generation of EV technology, or BEV3 as we call it, to market across our various brands and platforms. Just last week, we announced that we will invest $2.2 billion in Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant to build new electric trucks and SUVs and the Cruise Origin SUV \u2013 excuse me, shared autonomous vehicle, and the GMC HUMMER EV that we revealed just last week. This investment will create over 2,200 good paying jobs so it\u2019s a positive development for our Detroit-Hamtramck employees and it\u2019s also positive for General Motors\u2019 future. We are planning a dedicated EV Day to reveal more about our EV product, technology and infrastructure plans, and Mark will share more about that as well.But what sets the BEV3 infrastructure \u2013 or excuse me, architecture apart from our competitors and what gives us confidence is that it\u2019s an integrated approach and we have significant opportunities for scale. It maximizes the flexible battery architecture to create multiple entries across brands and across segments. Doug Parks, who now heads our Global Product Development and his team, developed this holistic strategy using a design-thinking mindset to understand what customers demand from an EV so we can capitalize and lead in this very important growth segment.At the same time, we know that the vehicle is just one element of an all-electric future, so we are also focused on leveraging partnerships and technologies to build an entire EV ecosystem to meet our customers\u2019 needs and expectations. And this is all designed to speed the adoption of electric vehicles. We know from our research that customers want a no-compromise vehicle that is fun to drive. And for anyone in the room who hasn\u2019t experienced instant torque, I highly recommend you do and I\u2019m sure we can help out.They also want beautiful design. They don\u2019t want to compromise. They also want a robust, reliable, fast-charging network that includes home, workplace and public solutions. And they want at least 300 miles of electric range on a full charge. And finally, they want pricing that is in line with internal combustion engine-powered vehicles. So we are aggressively working on all of these customer requirements. And we believe our new battery cell technology and manufacturing joint venture with LG Chem will bring together two leaders in battery science while creating jobs in Lordstown, Ohio. We plan to reduce cost to industry-leading levels and make EVs more affordable across a wide spectrum. With every battery chemistry and scale improvement, we get closer to the tipping point of ICE and EV cost parity.Now another major growth opportunity for General Motors is commercializing autonomous vehicles and mobility services. AVs matter because they\u2019ll save lives and the billions of dollars spent on debilitating injuries and property damage. Cruise continues to make really great progress. And as I mentioned, we just revealed the Origin, which was the shared autonomous vehicle developed jointly by Cruise, by General Motors and by Honda.And in addition to Cruise\u2019s approach to shared AVs, the advanced technology underpinning our vehicle systems continues to make them smarter and smarter. Our new digital vehicle platform greatly expands our existing over-the-air updates capability. And when you combine that with insights that we can gain from vehicle data, we will keep growing our capabilities. So this, along with the technology being developed at Cruise, will open up opportunities for the future of mobility, including the potential, however it evolves, for personal autonomous vehicles as we move forward. Mark and Dan are going to talk much more about EV and AV as we move through the morning.Next, I\u2019d like to talk just a little bit about the continued cultural transformation that we are undergoing at General Motors and that began six years ago. It all begins with our employees because they are fundamental to the vibrancy and success of the company. Everything we accomplish depends on their abilities, their engagement and their commitment. To reinvent transportation, diverse perspectives are critical, and I believe that we are demonstrating today the ambidexterity we need to simultaneously transform the organization while delivering today and also investing in products and services for the future.And I\u2019m proud of what we are doing as it relates to creating gender and pay equity across the company and our ongoing work to ensure we have diverse slates for candidates and for promotional opportunities. We really want to have a diverse and inclusive workforce, a workplace of choice and a culture where people can bring their true selves to work and where everyone understands our vision and believes their role in securing our future while sharing in this success.Now since 2009, we\u2019ve invested more than $27 billion in the U.S. manufacturing base. And in October, we committed to an additional $7.7 billion in facility investments that will either create new or retain over 9,000 jobs. These are good-paying jobs that support families and they support the community. And when I sit down and meet with employees from across the globe and across the country, their excitement is infectious. They want to win and they want to be part of a team that wins, and they understand that there\u2019s big opportunities in front of us that also come with significant changes. They want to know how they fit in and because like you, they\u2019re invested in our future, they want to know we\u2019re placing the right bets on the future in our vehicles, in AV and in EV.Of course, our cultural transformation also applies to other stakeholders, including our dealers. For years, General Motors\u2019 brands have consistently led J.D. Power\u2019s rankings in sales and service satisfaction and we\u2019re working to take that even further. We have charged a new team working across the company to develop a holistic approach for customer interactions. From the shopping experience for vehicles and services, to financing, to customer care, we want to provide a world-class, seamless and consistent experience throughout. And I can tell you, we\u2019re moving fast with our dedicated team.But as this industry transforms, our dealers are also navigating many changes, and we view our dealers as strategic partners. As we improve and modernize the overall customer experience, we also have dedicated executives that are working with our dealer leadership teams and our dealer partners to maximize customer service and ensure profitability, both at a corporate level and at a dealer level. Now we are moving quickly to the better future we envision, and we will continue to innovate to deliver safe, efficient, connected vehicles and services that lead the industry and exceed our customers\u2019 expectations.We are delivering on our commitments in terms of our products and setting ourselves up for the future and with our fundamental financial performance. Now I know we have work to do, no doubt, but I commit to you that we are making the right decisions to continue to drive strong performance. And by doing these things better, faster and more safely, with our economies of scale, we believe we will win in the marketplace today and in the future, and that is how we intend to create shareholder value.So now I would like to bring Mark Reuss up to the stage. Mark Reuss : Well, good morning, everybody, and thanks, Mary. And I got to tell you, as an engineer, there\u2019s a lot in the future. These are great days because I get to actually talk about what we\u2019ve been working on and then what we\u2019re getting ready to execute. So I\u2019m really happy to be here. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re here and thanks for tuning in, those of you tuning in.Mary covered a lot of ground and I\u2019m going to try to amplify some of her comments. But I\u2019d like to point out one connecting thread woven through the tapestry of the subjects she covered, and that is this company is still doing what we said we were going to do. For instance, last year at this event, we said we were going to begin the transformation of our Global Product Group. We made a lot of progress. We took out a significant amount of structural cost and we\u2019re still engineering and designing the future of everything every day. And we\u2019re doing it in a new culture, Mary touched on this a little bit.Yes, we saved a lot of money but the impact of this transformation goes beyond the bottom line by creating and sustaining this new corporate culture that we\u2019re trying to foster right now. We consolidated teams. We integrated the propulsion and vehicle engineers, the hardware and software engineers and created a true one-team mentality. If you think back about this, our company has always had propulsion in a separate location from vehicle engineering and software engineering in another location. So we\u2019ve done that. We knocked down the barriers between the groups and reorganized to keep them from being rebuilt.We created a strong centralized engineering workforce that can leverage talent from across the enterprise and across the globe. This eliminated the situations we faced before. We were actually competing internally for talent, especially in the software area. And by the way, our product group\u2019s workforce has gotten significantly younger, and more than 50% of our workforce has been with us for five years or less. Think about that for a minute. It\u2019s a tremendous transformation. The new structure provides a framework for more easily shareable, smarter engineering processes. And overall, it helps us work smarter, faster and simpler.Complexity reduction was a huge goal for 2019 and that continues into this year. Parts reduction, in particular, has been and remains a top priority, what we bring into our plants and put on our cars. Last year, we eliminated about 3,500 parts across the board or about 12% of our parts in plants. In 2020, we plan to eliminate a further 25% of parts in plants. We\u2019ll accomplish that by eliminating more trim levels, exterior colors, engines and transmissions and by bundling more sourcing options to better serve our customer.Best example, for our next-generation compact crossovers, we\u2019ll have more reused and shared parts. We will reduce total trim levels on Equinox and Terrain from eight to six, and we\u2019ll reduce engine variance from eleven to five. We\u2019ll reduce build combinations from 200 to less than 100 per program. And we\u2019ll see significant cost savings of the next generation of an already paid-for architecture that already took the mass out that Mary talked about. This action will help us self-fund our electrification programs. And beyond that, we\u2019ll continue doing all the big picture things like getting out of footprints that don\u2019t make money, and Steve will talk a little bit more about this a little later. That also includes adjusting our engineering and design centers to maximize impact and profit, all while taking a more modern approach to shaping the future.A perfect example of the revolutionary new mid-engine Corvette we unveiled last summer, and we\u2019re shipping to dealers and customers this month. In fact, we\u2019ve made number one, which went for a lot of money at Barrett-Jackson, and we funded \u2013 that all went to the Detroit public school systems. So we started that here the day before yesterday and so we\u2019re ramping up production. And we asked our design and engineering teams to re-imagine and recreate what was and is an iconic American sports car, moving the engine behind the cockpit. And all they did in response was come back with the greatest Corvette ever. The model run is sold out for the year, and I think it\u2019s going to be a tough-to-get car for quite a while and that is a good thing, very good thing.Another thing we\u2019re shaping with this same winning approach is the future of Cadillac. As we said last year, Cadillac is going to be about being Cadillac once again. And since then, we\u2019ve seen a strong finish to our sales year, and we\u2019ve seen the launch of the new vehicles like the XT6 and the CT5 and new retail initiatives like Cadillac Live, and of course, last night\u2019s stunning unveiling of the all-new iconic 2021 Escalade. It\u2019s an appropriate start to the year because we\u2019re confident the new Escalade will continue to win in the full-size luxury SUV segment, and because winning is contagious, that success will spread across our lineup in 2020. Here\u2019s a picture of Steve Carlisle last night on the West Coast so we\u2019re sort of doing an East Coast, West Coast thing here a little bit. But it was a big night for us, a lot of breakthroughs here and we\u2019ll share a little bit of that.So before we do that, let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights from Cadillac\u2019s week rolling into the Oscars.[Video Presentation]Fun stuff, right? So that was obviously Spike Lee and he actually created that film because he is so passionate about Escalade. So this is the kind of thing that we really need to cultivate and really start Cadillac going in a place, where we haven\u2019t been in a little while. So very exciting.Before I dive into the Cadillac brand details, let me say a few words about the new car, the Escalade, and those words would be something to the effect of the best full-size luxury SUV on the planet. Escalade remains the best-selling full-size luxury SUV on the market by far. Hope all of you take the opportunity to give the all-new Escalade a look because it\u2019s really something different, and we are excited and proud to put it out there. There\u2019s lots of different personas here if you haven\u2019t noticed as well. Its bold design give it unbelievable presence both on the road and at rest, and it is packed with the latest advanced technology inside the cabin and out, things that people flat out don\u2019t have.Nothing really demonstrates that more immediately than the curved OLED screen that greets you upon arrival. It\u2019s truly one-of-a-kind. This is \u2013 I mean, you have to experience it. It looks like you can actually reach into the screen and take the icons out of the screen. It\u2019s got more than 38 inches of display area and twice the pixel density of a 4K TV. This is the first OLED in automotive application. This technology enables bold imagery, perfect contrast and the largest color range available in any automotive application. As important as what you see is what you hear.Cadillac is proud for the first time ever in the automotive environment to present the legendary sound of AKG, an exclusive brand associated with commercial sound and only music studios and theaters, so it\u2019s very exclusive. Also important to this segment is space, and Escalade has even more passenger and cargo space, especially behind the third row with an impressive 70% more cargo room in the short wheelbase model. The whole interior embodies Cadillac\u2019s craftsmanship, style and comfort, which you will see here and feel when you get into it, and this is only the beginning.And especially when you get it on the road, where this vehicle has taken a dramatic leap forward in its driving dynamics, which were already very strong but this truck is the only luxury SUV to use Magnetic Ride Control, Electronic Limited Slip Differential and 4-corner Air Suspension simultaneously, delivering precise body control and remarkable agility for its size. The 4-corner Air Suspension offers ride-height adjustment of up to 4 inches, 2 inches lower at highway speeds for improved aerodynamics and 2 inches lower when ground clearance \u2013 or higher than when ground clearance \u2013 I got this flipped away so it\u2019s lower for aerodynamics on the highway 2 inches and it\u2019s higher for off-road capability. You can even drive the vehicle up and have it drop 2 inches for people to be able to get into it easier.So there\u2019s a lot of really creative things you can do with that. And of course, Escalade will be the first SUV with Super Cruise, the industry\u2019s first true hands-free driver assistance system for compatible highways. I\u2019ll talk more about Super Cruise in a moment, but it\u2019s set another example of doing what we said we\u2019re going to do. Just like we\u2019re doing with the entire Cadillac brand, it is focused, it is expanding and it is performing. For the second straight year, Cadillac set a global sales record. In 2019, sales in China grew almost 4%. And here\u2019s another stat that demonstrates Cadillac growth and momentum in China. Last month, we sold our 1 millionth Cadillac in China. 75% of those sales have occurred in just the last five years.Here in the U.S., last year, Cadillac saw its first year-over-year retail sales gain in the U.S. since 2013. This growth was led by Cadillac SUV sales, which were up 22.4% year-over-year. We have rounded out the Cadillac portfolio with full SUV coverage as well as our new sedans and their performance variance, which have yet to be released quite yet. In fact, the addition of the CT5 and the CT4 sedans to the portfolio year this year, Cadillac now has 94% coverage of the luxury market with the freshest luxury lineup in the industry. This is a big change from where we were.We\u2019ve also introduced retail innovations like Cadillac Live, an online experience that connects shoppers with a live product ambassador for a two-way guided virtual walkaround of any vehicle in our portfolio. I encourage you to try it yourself to see how it works. It is an incredible application of an all-new sales tool for people anywhere in the world. It educates customers on their terms. It tells them exactly what they want to know exactly when they want know it and then directs them to their local Cadillac dealer. It launched previously in Canada to great success, which by the way, Canada had a great sales month, and Cadillac Live is now up and running in the U.S.As we said last year, we\u2019re making Cadillac the tip of the corporate spear of innovation and technology at GM, and that applies to these retail initiatives as well as our actual advanced technology in our vehicles. Take Super Cruise, which I just mentioned. It\u2019s the most sophisticated integration of component systems of its type on the road today. And it\u2019s now validated by nearly 5.2 million miles of incident-free customer use. Unbelievable. We said we were going to expand both its coverage and its availability and we have. Last year, we announced 70,000 additional miles of available Super Cruise-compatible freeway, bringing the total to more than 200,000 miles of coverage. And here are some more Super Cruise facts as of November of 2019.Customers who have it are engaging the system nearly 50% of the time when it\u2019s available. A lot. Customers are driving upwards of 77,000 miles total each week using Super Cruise. And as Mary said, more than 85% of CT6 owners said that they would prefer or only consider a vehicle equipped with Super Cruise in the future. That\u2019s a huge, huge statistics. Those numbers add up to success to me and that\u2019s just the beginning of this game-changing feature. We are continuously improving the Super Cruise technology while expanding its availability. And later this year, we will introduce an enhanced version of Super Cruise that will feature quite a few upgrades.The most notable announcement and advancement was done last week. Cadillac CT4, CT5 and Escalade models with Super Cruise will offer a new automated lane change feature. This will allow the hands-free system to change lanes on compatible highways when requested by the driver and when conditions are deemed safe. Safety is an anchor of Super Cruise, I think you all know that. We also improved the vehicle control software, the user interface and the hands-free driving dynamics of the car itself. This enhanced version of Super Cruise will first be available on the 2021 CT5, which we\u2019re just launching right now, the CT4 and the Escalade in the second half of this year.And next year, we\u2019ll add Super Cruise to other brands and seven more models and will add 12 more in the following two years, including our full-size pickups, SUVs and more. We are rolling this out in a very big way. Many of these enhancements are a direct result of our all-new global digital platform, which we just debuted on the CT5. We followed it up with the Corvette, which we\u2019re just launching and going right now. And then we\u2019re going into the full-size SUVs and Escalade.So, this is really a very good rollout and a very staged rollout and we\u2019re well on our way. The global digital platform is the direct result of years of ramping our software expertise up and hiring an army of talented software engineers. It will be the new electronic architecture for all of our vehicles. And it allows us to expand over-the-air updates for many vehicles\u2019 systems and features. It\u2019s incredible what we can do with that. We have already done some over-the-air capability, but this new digital platform greatly expands it to be a completely customer-focused over-the-air system, updating with what will be an incredible bandwidth and speed. It will have 5G capacity but it\u2019s really about much more than that.In today\u2019s vehicles and importantly, tomorrow\u2019s, digital processing power is the new horsepower. Just as we fought horsepower wars in the past, we\u2019re now fighting software wars on the front lines with other OEMs and tech companies trying to acquire the top software engineering talent. We\u2019ve been fighting for this talent for a long time but we\u2019ve already stepped it up in the past five years, during which we\u2019ve greatly increased our software, electrical and computer engineering hires, and as a result, our knowledge base and our expertise. This continues full speed ahead in 2020 when we\u2019ll increase our headcount target again, further growing our software engineering footprint and mix, which spreads from Warren, to Markham, Ontario to Israel and many spots in between, as you can see.We have executed a strategy to have hubs around the world wherever that talent is. And that\u2019s not just in Silicon Valley, by the way. Markham has the second greatest concentration of software talent in North America, for example. And we have a beautiful office there with more than 700 employees that will probably grow to 1,000 this year, alongside of an incubator, and we have a great relationship with nearby Waterloo University. This strategy is paying off already in the form of our new digital platform, the new electronic architecture I just mentioned.Our new electronic system has 4.5 terabytes per hour of data processing power. Think about that for a minute. 5x the capability of our current electrical architecture. This is what will enable an electric future and autonomous driving. It will lead to, among other wins, EVs with more range and EVs, more of them, period. As far as Cadillac and EVs go, we have publicly said, Cadillac will be the first brand to first brand to launch an electric crossover off of our next-gen electric vehicle architecture.As Mary said, we will unveil Cadillac\u2019s first EV in April. Cadillac will offer mostly electric vehicles by the end of this decade. And Cadillac\u2019s EVs will have names that are words, not alphanumeric designations. Glad I got a little laugh out of that. That\u2019s good. Yes, no, we are doing that. What I can tell you about one thing for certain about our EV program, we\u2019re going to have another event next month. Wednesday, March 4, in Warren, Michigan that will focus solely on EVs so that\u2019s an event that you\u2019re not going to want to miss, and that will be taking place in our design activity at the heart of the Tech Center and it\u2019s going to be an incredible thing. I\u2019m not going to go into too much of that today, but I can tell you what our broad strategy is and how we deeply committed are to it.We\u2019ve been at this an awful long time and we\u2019ve learned an awful lot about it. You might think I\u2019m referring to the EV1 of the 1990s but we go back even further than that, as you can see. This photo from 1912 shows one of the several hundred electric GM work trucks powered by lead acid and Edison nickel-iron batteries. Think about that for a minute, that\u2019s pretty cool. Today, 108 years later, we have as a robust a strategy for rolling out EVs as anyone could have. I can guarantee you that no other company is doing what we\u2019re doing because no other company can do what we\u2019re doing. No one can match our combination of advanced technology, flexibility and scale.And you\u2019ll see this for the first time as our program rolls out. Our EV program is what will help take us and the world to our stated vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We\u2019ll have a complete lineup of EVs, including the pickup truck we told you about and its stable mates. Our battery pack design, like our next-generation architecture, is extremely flexible. And together, the combination of the new architecture and the pack will allow multibrand, multisegment applications. You can see this here as it builds on the slide. This is the actual math from our design and the engineered solution that we have. So this is actually real. We showed you a little bit of this last year, but this is the actual \u2013 this is it. It\u2019s pretty much engineered in time and this is the math.The slide clearly shows how we can use many different of these configurations of the battery pack, all from the same starting point with the same materials, depending on the product that we\u2019re building. This illustrates the ice cube tray metaphor we\u2019ve used before to explain this. You can put in as much water to make as many cubes as you need. The tray still takes up the same amount of space in the freezer. As you can see, this particular ice cube tray allows us to use as many battery packs as the vehicle specifications call for : 6, for a smaller EV or we can go up to 8, 10, 12 or even 24 with two 12s stacked on top of each other.The new application has significant improvements over the previous generation, including larger footprint with lower height, higher energy density, a flexible modular design, higher-powered DC fast charging and one of the biggest advantages that this approach gives us is how much flexibility we can dial into any one program. This allows us to be as agile as the market dictates, never locked into any one thing. We can meet the market head on, whatever it is.We can adjust on the fly if we need to. It also means we\u2019re not spending money validating way more designs than necessary. We just slap the configuration we need into whatever product we need whenever we need it. Again, most of our competitors lack this ability. Most of them will have to melt and re-pour. A lot of those are one-off snowflakes, an existing architecture that has a battery that\u2019s been put into it, which is fine, but it\u2019s not the long-term scalable, economic, market-agile solution that we have.Nobody we know of has this combination of these levels of flexibility, speed and scale. The GMC Hummer EV battery electric truck we announced last week that Mary mentioned is a great example of all of that. And in case you missed it, here\u2019s the ad we ran on the Super Bowl, giving you a little bit of a tease of what\u2019s to come here.[Video Presentation]That\u2019s a great commercial. But this will change a lot of minds when we show the whole truck here of what an EV can do and what it is when it\u2019s revealed here on May 20, so we\u2019re very excited about that.When we go to market, we\u2019ll have 1-motor, 2-motor, 3-motor versions, offering different ranges, different performance at different price points to meet the customers wherever they may be. If the customer wants a basic package, we\u2019ll have that. If the customer wants true off-road capability and towing capability, we\u2019ll have that too. Whether or not we are first on the market, which we just might be here because we\u2019re fall of next year, I am totally confident that we are going to be the best on the market, because we\u2019ve engineered this strategy and this approach with these component sets, and I\u2019m really excited about it. Our offering won\u2019t be just one ticket. This will be architected to be scalable and used for multiple brands with multiple variants for multiple customers.So when the market demands those variants, where can our competitors go? We can go to variant X, Y or Z quickly. We\u2019ll be introducing multiple models a year, as market responsive as we want to be and the market dictates. We can get into that more next month at our EV Day, but suffice to say, I really like our position heading into the area of electrification and I like it for a lot of different reasons. I think you\u2019ll be very excited about some of the things we go into a little more detail that I\u2019ve talked about today. We are working hard on our own and with our partners that have developed lower-cost, better performing chemistry, and we\u2019re making great progress. We\u2019re developing our own intellectual property in many areas of electrification, which will greatly benefit this company in the future. But there\u2019s a lot of vertical integration. Again, we\u2019ll go into more of that here next month, but this is a very, very well-thought out strategy.For instance, our battery chemistry development itself could be a new revenue stream for us down the road, and that\u2019s just one example. As Mary said, we\u2019re committed to the reuse and recycling of our 100% of our end-of-life EV batteries, and we\u2019ll be the first full-line OEM to vertically integrate and manufacture battery cells. We have the scale to provide EVs to the mass market, given our strength in North America and China. And we have the benefits of having done all the elimination of waste and reduction of cost and reuse of parts and the materials that I talked about a little while ago. We\u2019re applying all of that knowledge and process and more to our electric vehicle program, and it will boost the bottom line. That\u2019s a big reason why we keep saying we\u2019re going to have a profitable EV program, and it\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re working toward every day.Everything we\u2019re doing in the Global Product Group and everything we\u2019re doing with Cadillac and our other brands is helping us set the stage for a giant leap forward into the electrification space. And I believe that when all of that happens, and it is happening, we, more than any other company, automotive or otherwise, will be poised to win.So, I want to thank you very much for listening and coming today. And I want to introduce my colleague and good friend, the President of North America, Mr. Barry Engle. Thank you very much. Barry Engle : Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being with us. In our time together this morning, I\u2019d like to do several things. First, I want to give you an update on our 2019 share performance and talk a bit about how we\u2019re navigating some of the segment shifts that are occurring in the industry. Then we\u2019re going to deep dive trucks to discuss how we\u2019re thinking about and managing that really important part of the business. And we\u2019ll end on what\u2019s to come in 2020, including our full-size SUV launches. What we saw last year was a continuation of the segment shifts that are reshaping our industry. Customers keep moving out of traditional sedans to crossovers and SUVs as well as trucks and vans. And GM\u2019s strategy to manage these changes has been to pivot, discontinuing 10 car nameplates and reconfiguring our manufacturing footprint, while at the same time strengthening our lineup of crossovers, SUVs and trucks.As a result of this proactive refocusing of our portfolio, we significantly reduced our 2019 retail car sales in the U.S. while increasing our sales in the other more profitable growth segments. In the case of crossovers and SUVs, we delivered record retail sales and share, further increasing our number one leadership position in this segment. Similarly, in trucks and vans, we also increased retail sales and maintained our number one leadership position. So in aggregate, our U.S. retail share was essentially flat year-over-year, maintaining our position as the best-selling OEM. I think we\u2019ve managed to pivot pretty well. We were able to hold total retail share despite giving up a full point to discontinued cars and despite significant production losses, both from the strike as well as our full-size truck changeover.Now the reason that we\u2019re so focused on the retail business is because we see it as the best barometer of true consumer demand and it\u2019s generally more profitable than fleet. We\u2019re committed to maintaining our position as the overall U.S. market leader. We\u2019re particularly focused on growing our retail share and doing so in the most profitable segments. And one of those segments is crossovers, where we increased our U.S. retail sales last year by 10%, posting the industry\u2019s largest share gain. And much of this growth can be attributed to the strength of our unrivaled product portfolio, includes 14 nameplates with multiple entries in each of our four brands to give optimal market coverage across the subsegments. We\u2019re leveraging common vehicle architectures and scale, now more than one million units per year in the U.S. alone to reduce complexity and lower cost of our crossovers.At the same time, we\u2019re managing customer-facing content and styling to maximize brand and product differentiation. Up-level sub-brands and trims provide further differentiation and drive a richer, more profitable mix. Our crossover portfolio is one of the freshest in the industry. The average age will be just 1.6 years by the end of 2020. Examples of the new products include the recently launched Chevy Blazer, an all-new entry, which steadily gained share throughout 2019. Last year, we also introduced XT6, an important new Cadillac entry and an updated XT5, which is the brand\u2019s best-selling model. Together with the segment-leading XT4, Cadillac now has the freshest lineup in the lux crossover segment. And late last year, we launched an updated GMC Acadia.In 2020, this year, the new crossovers just keep coming. We\u2019ll launch in the high-volume compact segment two completely new additions to the Chevy and Buick lineups, the Trailblazer and the Encore GX. Additionally, we\u2019ll launch updated models of Chevy Equinox and Traverse, Buick Envision and Terrain and \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Envision and Enclave as well as the GMC Terrain. So with all this great new product, I fully expect 2020 to be another record growth year for us in crossovers. Another important and very profitable growth segment for us is trucks. And once again, we are really well positioned with an outstanding product portfolio. It\u2019s helped us build the most successful truck franchise in the industry. We sell more trucks in the U.S. than anybody by a wide margin. We are unique in that we have not one but two very strong truck brands and distribution channels in Chevrolet and GMC. We have award-winning midsized trucks, the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon.Last year, we launched our all-new full-size trucks, Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra. Both of these vehicles are available in light and heavy-duty versions. And in the case of Chevrolet, we recently returned to the medium-duty commercial market with a great new line of Silverado chassis cab trucks. So at GM, we love trucks. We absolutely understand how strategically important they are to our business. And that\u2019s why as the industry transitions from ICE to EV, we will continue to lead the way. And it starts with the all-new GMC Hummer EV, a super truck that redefines what an electric vehicle can be. And we\u2019re going to share more of our plans at our EV Day in early March.Now let\u2019s take a look at how these all new full-size trucks are performing. As a reminder, 2019 was a transition year as we wound down the previous generation models and launched our all-new next-gen trucks. This was the largest launch in the history of General Motors and one of the most complex. To maximize quality, volume and profits, we implemented a phased launch strategy, transitioning one plant at a time, launching with limited configurations and gradually expanding body styles, trims and powertrains.The light-duty versions ramped up during the first half of the year and the heavy duties began production only in the second half of the year. What that meant in practical terms is that we had limited availability throughout the year. Given those availability constraints, we chose to concentrate our volume in retail and skewed allocation towards our relatively more profitable GMC brand. For the full year, we gained one point of retail segment share versus prior year with GMC driving the gain. However, 2019 was really a tale of two halves. With reasonable availability of light-duty trucks in the second half, we gained nearly five points of overall truck share versus the first half, with both brands growing share.As availability improves, we continue to see strengthening run rates. And in fact, in January, overall retail share, I just got the numbers this morning, came in at 41%. And there is further upside as the recently launched heavy-duty trucks and light-duty diesels become more readily available. We expect continued year-over-year share \u2013 truck share gains in 2020, given a full year of uninterrupted production across the entire model range of all of our new trucks. And as we do grow our truck business, we are focused on delivering high-quality share. Hence, the emphasis on retail and within that, you can see we\u2019re achieving our strongest shares in the highest price bands.With the new next-gen trucks, we removed important bottlenecks to allow increased production of the more expensive crew cabs and diesels. We also introduced two new very well-received models, the Chevrolet Trail Boss and GMC AT4. They come from the factory with lifted suspensions, big tires and enhanced off-road capabilities. Other new features, technologies, trims and options allow our customers to configure ever more luxurious and capable trucks.This chart also demonstrates the competitive advantage of our two-brand portfolio. Our mainstream Chevrolet brand is strong in the middle of the market, while our premium GMC brand nicely complements it and skews heavily towards the higher end. Our strategy is to manage the mix, optimize production and increase share in the most profitable segments of the market.In our pursuit of truck profits, we remain committed to disciplined pricing and incentives. With the new trucks, we\u2019ve been able to grow our average transaction prices for GMC and Chevrolet in both light-duty and heavy duty. At GMC, we have the highest ATPs in the industry while Chevrolet is positioned between our two main competitors. These ATPs that you see here are full-year averages. If we look specifically at Q4, the most recent quarter, we\u2019d see that incentives across the segment did tick up slightly. But we responded in a disciplined, measured way, maintaining our premium, with both brands still posting solid year-over-year ATP growth.As a percentage of ATP, GMC incentives were below industry average and Chevrolet was in line. Maintaining a healthy channel mix is also key to maximum truck profits. Compared to our main competitors, we have the lowest fleet mix. Of the fleet business that we do have, with the lowest sales to daily rental fleets, concentrating instead on more profitable commercial and government business. We also have the lowest lease penetration. So, not surprisingly as a result of these strategies, we enjoy the highest residual values amongst our main competitors.Now starting with Chevrolet, I\u2019d like to quickly talk about what\u2019s new on our full-size trucks and help you understand why we\u2019re confident in their success. Our Chevy Silverado has earned a reputation for being the most dependable, longest-lasting truck on the road. And our new truck is simply the strongest, most advanced Silverado we\u2019ve ever built. The improvements were based on deep insights of how real pickup owners use their trucks and include 50 new industry firsts. We offer more trims to ensure we\u2019ve got just the right truck for every customer. Our powertrain lineup includes best-in-class V8 horsepower and torque and an all-new light-duty diesel with a best-in-class highway fuel economy rating of 33 miles per gallon. We\u2019re not the only ones that are impressed by this truck.Customers have taken notice as well. In our brand tracking survey, Silverado now has the highest excellent opinion scores in the industry and is at record levels of consideration. This truck is the real deal and it further enhances our strong Silverado franchise that has been built over many years. Unlike any of our competitors, GM has a second truck brand that we have successfully developed to target the most profitable pockets of the business.Our Sierra pickup leverages the GMC brand\u2019s DNA of bold, capable and precisely crafted to become the only truck uniquely positioned as a premium entry. Within GMC, we\u2019ve developed the aspirational Denali sub-brand that ratchets up the luxury. It\u2019s available across all GMC products, trucks and SUVS. And if this Denali sub-brand were a stand-alone luxury franchise, it would outsell, in terms of volume, Lincoln, Infinity, Volvo, Land Rover, and it would do it with a higher average transaction price, than Mercedes, BMW or Audi.With the launch of the new Sierra pickup, we created yet another, a second sub-brand, that we call the AT4, and it\u2019s an upscale off-road product. Combined, the Denali and AT4 are approaching half of all new Sierra sales. The new Sierra pickups are loaded with innovations, including the world\u2019s first 6-function MultiPro Tailgate.Sierra\u2019s the only pickup to offer head-up display, it\u2019s a feature normally found in luxury cars. It also has a rear camera mirror, a great safety feature, which expands the driver\u2019s field of rear vision. The pro grade Trailering system is a suite of new features and technologies designed to make towing safe and easy. Eight cameras provide up to 15 different views around the truck and trailer. And the Sierra\u2019s carbon fiber box is yet another industry-first, offering best-in-class dent, scratch and corrosion resistance. It\u2019s the subject of one of our latest ads that we call Hurricane, and I\u2019d like to show you the ad now.[Video Presentation]The heavy-duty versions of our all-new truck are worth a special mention. These models, available as both a Silverado and a Sierra, began production in the latter part of the year and will be very important new weapons in our truck arsenal. For the first time, the heavy duties are completely differentiated from their light-duty counterparts.With unique sheet metal and a bigger, bolder look, these trucks are also much more capable. Max towing capacity is up over 50% to 35,500 pounds. This is important because heavy-duty customers, they do tow with their trucks, and they will appreciate the new Allison 10-speed transmission that we\u2019ve mated to our proven Duramax Diesel. Additional production capacity will also allow us to better meet demand for these high-end trucks that carry the best ATPs in the industry.Roughly 80% of our new GMC heavies have been either AT4s or Denalis with ATPs over $70,000. The success of these trucks shows there\u2019s a real customer appetite for very capable premium trucks. And our GMC organization knows how to sell those vehicles, and it\u2019s the right channel to carry the new Hummer EV. The same new architecture that we\u2019ve used for our pickups will support an all-new family of full-size SUVs.Our full-size SUVs are iconic people and cargo haulers. The Chevrolet Suburban has been in continuous production for 85 years, making it the longest-running nameplate in the global auto industry. Together with the Chevrolet Tahoe and the GMC Yukon, our full-size SUV franchise has historically led the industry, with over 70% market share in the U.S., while in the luxury space, Cadillac Escalade leads this segment. Each of our entries have been redesigned to offer class-leading interior space, exclusive technologies and features and the best driving dynamics in the full-size segment.Like our pickups, these vehicles also command high ATPs, and we\u2019ll be using similar trim mix and packaging strategies to drive profitability. We\u2019ve unveiled these new SUVs over the last number of weeks. They\u2019ve been very well received and we look forward to bringing them to market in mid-2020.So as you can see, we\u2019re focused on growing our U.S. retail business and doing it profitably in crossovers, trucks and SUVs. Our product investments have focused in these segments and resulted in a very strong fresh portfolio. 2020 will be a good year as we benefit from the full year impact of last year\u2019s big launches and continue to add momentum with other important new vehicle introductions this year. We\u2019re now going to take a 15-minute break, after which we\u2019ll continue with our presentations. Thank you.[Break-Out Session] Rocky Gupta : Okay. Let\u2019s get restarted. So, as Mary mentioned earlier, Matt Tsien was going to be here in person, but out of an abundance of caution, we decided to pretape his message. He is feeling absolutely fine and he\u2019ll be joining us by phone for the Q&A session. So let me turn it over to the taping of Matt. Matt Tsien : It\u2019s a pleasure for me to speak with you today to give you an update on GM in China and to share with you our plan for sustained development here. After two decades of continuous growth, China\u2019s vehicle market has entered a transition period with challenges that is putting pressure on our profitability, leading to lower equity income from our China operations. Regulatory pressures on fuel economy standards and new energy vehicles continue to increase. The investment required for our new energy vehicle programs and fuel-saving technologies is considerable.Although we haven\u2019t seen a direct impact on our performance that is directly attributable to the prolonged trade tension between the U.S. and China, we know that it is hurting the Chinese economy and ultimately, weakening consumer confidence. And China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, remains weak versus prior years. This has had a negative impact on the translation of our earnings into U.S. dollars. While these challenges were widely anticipated, the recent coronavirus outbreak is unexpected and is likely to put further pressure on China\u2019s economy. Prior to the virus outbreak, we had estimated the industry would be slightly down in 2020. We now expect additional near-term volume impact. GM\u2019s target is to perform in line with the industry in 2020.Generally speaking, we expect to see earnings from our China business grow along with industry recovery. China remains the world\u2019s largest vehicle market. Cyclical downturns are normal in mature markets, so it\u2019s no surprise for cyclicality to develop in a market that has witnessed nearly two decades of continuous growth. Having said that, we still believe this market can grow to well over 30 million units annually in the coming years. We\u2019re leveraging our strong business foundation built over the past two decades, combined with China\u2019s scale, to achieve success for the long haul.With Chinese consumers purchasing power getting stronger, the pursuit of prestige will continue to drive the industry consumption upgrade. As a result, the demand for SUVs and luxury vehicles will remain strong. We\u2019re bullish about our downstream opportunities as well. We have a strong presence covering after sales with ACDelco, automotive financing through SAIC-GMAC, automotive leasing through SAIC-GMF, insurance through INSAIC and connectivity through OnStar.As the largest EV market in the world, China will play a key role in moving us toward a zero emissions future. Leveraging China\u2019s scale is an enabler for GM to achieve profitability on EVs globally. China\u2019s vehicle market peaked at over 20 million units in 2017. It finished at 25.4 million units in 2019, down 4.2% from the previous year and down 10% since the peak in 2017.As I just said, a further decrease is expected in 2020. As the environment keeps evolving, we\u2019ve proactively adapted our business, including addressing cost across materials, SG&A and manufacturing. Flexibility is built in to our manufacturing facilities across China, giving us the ability to adjust shift patterns and working hours to rescale production based on demand. While models in high demand, like the Cadillac XT4 and Buick Regal, drove some of our plants to work six days a week, other plants reduced working hours in response to the softening demand for their products last year.The production schedule adjustments has resulted in a reduction in associated costs, minimizing the impact on our bottom line. Based on market feedback, we improved capital discipline to ensure that we\u2019re making the right decisions and rolling out the right products and technologies at the right time. On the product side, amid the overall market downturn, we have seen variations in segment performance. As I mentioned earlier, the luxury and SUV segments have continued to expand. Our launches of the large SUV models last year, especially the XT6 from Cadillac, benefited from the segment\u2019s growth.Baojun, however, has been facing more pressure from weak consumer confidence, especially in lower-tier cities, where the brand has a major presence. Baojun has been pivoting to a higher pricing position over the past year. This is a necessary and important strategic move upward but it doesn\u2019t mean that we are abandoning the affordable entry-level price positioning that it has long held.With cross-brand alignment, the Wuling brand will further expand its passenger car lineup with products that offer compelling value. As SGMW is a fast-moving company, we expect to see sales improvements starting this year. GM is among the pioneers in adopting three-cylinder engines, while improving fuel efficiency, while maintaining dynamic driving performance. Although we firmly believe three-cylinder engines have long-term benefit, we acknowledge that some consumers have been hesitant to purchase vehicles featuring them. This has impacted the performance of a number of our launches.We have taken steps to address this challenge. While continuously educating consumers on the benefits of three-cylinder engines, we are going to offer four-cylinder engines as an added option in some of our products. We also foresee that improving product mix toward larger and more premium products will increase opportunities for adjacencies. SAIC-GMAC is targeting financing nearly 50% of SGM vehicle purchases this year, up from 44% last year. Its financing of SGMW vehicle purchases increased from 12% in 2018 to 20% in 2019 and is expected to grow to 30% in 2020.These actions and the strong demand for higher-margin products have enabled us to keep our core business profitable. We expect to remain profitable going forward. Looking ahead, we are fully committed to a zero emissions future. A few years ago, GM committed to launching 10 NEVs in China between 2016 and 2020. We will actually exceed this plan as our local Baojun and Wuling brands accelerate their EV rollout with local solutions.Here, you can see two of our newest EV launches in China : the Chevrolet Menlo and Baojun E200. Achieving the zero emission future requires significant investment in electrification in the near term, which will impact profitability. However, it will put us in a position to be solidly profitable in electrification over the long term. Major challenges exist at this time, including high cost of batteries, low consumer acceptance and dependence on government subsidies. We believe achieving global scale is essential for profitability. As Mark said, no other company can do what we\u2019re doing.With our combination of advanced technology, flexibility and scale, GM\u2019s China operations will benefit from GM technology and contribute to GM\u2019s scale. China is already the world\u2019s largest market for NEVs, and we are applying a diverse range of new energy solutions for our global and local brands here. Our established capability in China for battery pack testing and assembly will support the steady rollout of NEVs and help lower battery costs.With the rollout of our EV architecture, we will enjoy a complete lineup of EVs, including those in the important and growing luxury and SUV segments, translating into profitable growth.In 2019, while we launched more than 20 new or refreshed models, performance was impacted by the industry downturn, transition to the China VI emission standard, our Baojun brand transition and weaker acceptance of some of our 3-cylinder-based entries. This year, our launch profile is going to be quite different, especially regarding propulsion. Our key launch products in 2020 will come with 4-cylinder engines. While the 2019 launch products with 3-cylinder engines will carry through into 2020, certain products with 3-cylinder engines already in the market will be available with 4-cylinder engines starting in the second quarter. Our launches this year will focus on luxury vehicles as well as mid and large SUVs and MPVs, which, as you have seen, have become the segments with the strongest growth in consumer demand. Following the successful launches of the Cadillac XT6 and Buick Enclave in 2019, the Chevrolet Blazer coming this year will also tap into the large SUV segment.In the luxury market, the CT4 sedan, being launched in 2020, will give Cadillac its strongest and most complete lineup ever, enabling it to compete in all key luxury segments. Meanwhile, our youngest local brand, Baojun, will maintain its intensive launch cadence to reinforce its new brand image and portfolio. In line with the brand\u2019s upward move, four new models were introduced in eight months last year.As China enters an era of quality growth, consumption upgrade has led to steady growth in the luxury segment. Cadillac maintained its positive growth momentum and posted another record year for sales in 2019, which we expect to build upon in 2020 and beyond. Cadillac\u2019s compound annual growth rate over the past five years was 28%, significantly outperforming the overall luxury segment CAGR of 13%. As a result, Cadillac has steadily increased its luxury market share in China from 5.4% in 2016 to 7% in 2019, a year that was impacted by the early transition to China VI in many markets.In summary, we view China as a strategic asset for General Motors. Over the past two decades, we have established a strong foundation in China, which is key to our sustained growth in the future. We have an enduring partnership with SAIC, which has worked closely with us to drive the success of our joint ventures. Our five brands in China have broad coverage across key segments through extensive dealer networks. In addition to our two manufacturing joint ventures, SGM and SGMW, our PATAC automotive engineering and design joint venture enables us to engage in co-development programs. As the market becomes more mature, we have seen increasing opportunities for our successful adjacent businesses, many of them in partnership with SAIC as well.Through global collaboration, we have built a highly competitive cost structure to continuously drive costs down and drive efficiency up. Leveraging the China market is helping GM achieve considerable economies of scale on a global basis. By 2025, about 95% of SAIC GM vehicles sold in China will share common global architectures with the rest of the world, up from about 70% in 2018. It all adds up to our China joint ventures remaining profitable, self-funding and dividend paying to support our entire company.With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to my colleague, Steve Kiefer. He will give us an update on GM South America and GM International Operations. Thank you. Steve Kiefer : Well, thank you to Matt\u2019s recording, and welcome to all of you. A special welcome to our international sites that are joining us by webcast today. It\u2019s really a pleasure and an honor for me to be leading this GMI team and to be here presenting to you. For these next couple of minutes, I\u2019m going to talk a little bit about where we\u2019ve been, what our plans are this year and where we\u2019re headed in our GMI international markets.As Mary mentioned, I was named to this role in the fourth quarter of last year. Previously, I was leading our global purchasing and supply chain team and really interacting closely with all of our suppliers around the world. In my opinion, the best automotive supply base in the industry. And of course, we\u2019re going to count on those suppliers as our partners as we move to profitability in all of these international sites.So just by definition, at General Motors, we define GM International as all of our operations outside of North America and excluding China. We participate in over 60 markets that stretch from one side of the globe to the other, including South America, some key strategic markets in Europe, Africa, Middle East and of course, some key markets in Asia, again, excluding China. Every one of these markets is unique and every one offers us some very interesting opportunities.In 2019, in these markets, we delivered 1.3 million vehicles and generated $16 billion in net sales across these markets, spanning four of our General Motors brands. Now from a profitability standpoint, the last few years have been very challenging, driven by especially in South America and also some transformation efforts and costs that are now beginning to pay off in these international markets. I\u2019m really excited to enter into 2020 with a clear strategic vision to turn every market we participate in to a profitable market. So, let\u2019s look at our plan to achieve the targeted returns across our markets. At GMI, we use a strategic framework with four pillars to optimize our operations market by market with our objective of improving profitability by $2 billion.First, in markets where we\u2019re very well positioned, core markets, markets where we have a very strong franchise, we\u2019ll optimize and look to grow. These include markets like South America, where we have a very dominant market share. Second, we\u2019re developing very unique and interesting partnerships to maximize our returns in some key growth markets. One example is Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, we\u2019re working with a third-party that manufactures engines, vehicles under a license from General Motors, and they manage their own distribution network.In that market last year, we achieved year, we achieved record sales of 250,000 units, giving us, yes, 96% market share, 96% market share in that market. Thirdly, in markets where we don\u2019t have historically significant scale, like Japan and like some of the markets now in Europe, we\u2019ll pursue a niche presence by selling high-end vehicles imported from larger markets. Mark and Barry showed you some of these great vehicles that we have at General Motors. These vehicles have high demand in these niche markets. And these vehicles, coupled with a very lean sales structure, have an opportunity to generate solid returns in these markets.Of course, the final option is to exit markets that do not have a clear pathway to sustainable profitability and to meet our target returns. Today, you\u2019ve seen General Motors take decisive actions to exit markets like India and Russia. And today, several other markets are under active study. Bottom line is, we are taking appropriate actions to ensure we move to generate target returns in every market that we participate decisively and with urgency.With that, let\u2019s look at our current financial outlook for the non-China portion of GMI. As mentioned before, despite improvements versus 2018, we lost money in 2019. A significant turnaround effort with clear strategies for each of these markets is being executed to return these markets to profitability as soon as possible. Overall, we\u2019re targeting a $2 billion improvement in our EBIT-adjusted earnings to mid-single-digit returns in the medium term and ROIC of 20% in the medium term. This is really a critical year. 2020 will be a critical year for GMI. We\u2019re committed to significant improvement in 2020 and achieving segment profitability in 2021 as a key milestone on that journey to profitability.The most significant driver of the South America improvement is defending our market share leadership with a new lineup of great products, also with an optimized manufacturing footprint and contributions from all of our key stakeholders across the region : our suppliers, our dealers, our unions and of course, governments. Across the remaining GMI countries and markets, we\u2019re executing a significant business transformation through core market growth and partnerships that I mentioned earlier. One of the major elements of our strategy is the introduction of a new generation of vehicles referred to as our global family of vehicles. You\u2019ve heard us refer to it in the past as GEM. And these were launched last year, and I\u2019ll talk more about that shortly.One challenge we\u2019ve seen over the last several years, especially in South America, has been macro pressures. We\u2019re expecting a gradual recovery over the coming years, but you\u2019ve heard that before and we\u2019ve heard that before as well. So in parallel, we\u2019re executing actions to derisk our financials, creating natural hedge where possible. So let\u2019s zoom in on a few of the key markets, starting with South America. As I mentioned, GM leads the market in both volume and market share, and we have for nearly 20 years in South America.We have a long and proud legacy here and our reputation shows it. In fact, Chevrolet\u2019s brand health in South America is the strongest of that brand anywhere in the world. South America loves Chevrolet and so do we. As I mentioned, the greatest challenge to our position in South America is the macroeconomic volatility. As all of you know, currencies have significantly devalued, the industry has contracted and inflation is significant across all the key markets. So we\u2019ve restructured, taking our breakeven point down by 40%. And by working with all of our stakeholders, we\u2019ve gained significant contributions, helping us define a path to a viable and sustainable business model across South America.We\u2019re also working to streamline and integrate our South America product portfolio, optimizing our manufacturing footprint with a focus on capacity utilization and increased localization efforts, which again will significantly reduce our FX exposure. Now as I said, we do expect gradual improvement in the macroeconomics, which combined with our new product launches and restructuring efforts will help us reach our target of profit improvement of over $1 billion in this region. Let me move on to Korea. Korea is another market where we\u2019ll continue to optimize and grow.Early in 2018, we focused on optimizing our manufacturing footprint to match the demand for that region and our global demand. This led demand. This led to the closure of our Gunsan facility in 2018 and the subsequent sale of that facility in 2019. This was a bold and difficult, yet needed step in structural cost reductions. Korea is a key production sourcing and engineering hub for General Motors, both for the Korean domestic market as well as for global vehicle and component export and global engineering support. In fact, Korea is the home to one of our very important engineering base. We have over 3,000 engineers located in Korea who have historically taken the lead in developing some of our small vehicles.We\u2019ll continue to fully leverage those very capable resources for our global product development. It\u2019s critical that we retain very strong alignment between our management and the workforce, which has historically been difficult in Korea. With the strong support of the Korean government and our Korean supply base, which is also outstanding, we will keep the Korean operations competitive and sustainable. As a result of our restructuring efforts, we\u2019ve eliminated $0.5 billion in structural costs, supporting our objective to secure a competitive footprint and achieve enterprise profitability from this year onward in Korea.Now, let me talk for a little bit about product and really the engine of our growth and our return to profitability across GMI. And that\u2019s, as I mentioned earlier, this global family of vehicles. Here\u2019s a couple of them here, the notchback and the hatchback. This family of vehicles really simplifies our global architecture. We\u2019re leveraging global designs and sharing components across the entire globe. This architecture also enhances our profitability by bringing significant scale to our sourcing and improving manufacturing efficiency. So the initial launches are now complete in key markets, such as South America and China, and we\u2019re in the process of launching in Mexico as we speak.Let me talk a little more specifically about our first vehicle from this family in South America shown here, which is the Onix that launched last September. The Onix brand has been a volume leader for us in South America. In fact, it has been the number one vehicle in Brazil for several years. Based on this outstanding design, the rich interior, the high safety and connectivity content shown here, the market reaction has been incredible. Slightly likes Cadillacs, the Brazilians love the Onix. This is a great vehicle. And it now accounts for 40% of our sales in Brazil and Argentina. And it\u2019s picked up 10% segment share since its launch last September. And all of this at a higher profit level than the vehicle it replaced.So this is the first of four vehicles that we\u2019ll launch on this platform. And let me assure you, the best is yet to come. Our team in South America will be launching a small SUV, shadow shown here, next month in March. And then two more vehicles will be launched by 2022. This global family of vehicles will eventually represent 75% of our sales in South America, and we will have sold more than 2 million units across GMI by the end of 2023. In short, the global family of vehicles is important for GM in these key growth markets, especially South America, where it is contributing $0.5 billion of profit improvement, helping us meet our financial objectives and replacing the previous product.Let me just conclude with a couple of thoughts about the future of GMI. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve had significant focus on streamlining our operations and strengthening our partnerships to deliver a winning portfolio. We will continue to focus on profitability in these regions. We\u2019ve made great progress with our market leadership in South America, great progress in streamlining the operations, specifically in Korea and throughout the GMIO regions. And with this new group of global vehicles, I am confident that we will be set up for profitability in the years to come. As all of you know, this is a very dynamic, fast-moving environment with a variety of challenges and opportunities. Our GM International team will continue to act fast, focus on profitability in every market that we serve and deliver on our commitments. So with that, I\u2019d like to introduce Dan Ammann, who\u2019s going to talk to us about the future of Cruise, and I thank you for the time. Dan Ammann : Okay. Hi everyone. At Cruise, we have a point of view that the cost of transportation today is too high. It costs us too many lives, it costs too much time, it costs us too much money and it costs us too much impact to the planet. And we have equal conviction that self-driving technology deployed at large scale in an all-electric and shared mode is the single most powerful thing that we can do to reduce that cost of transportation that we have today. And so it\u2019s our mission at Cruise to make that technology as safe as possible and get it deployed as rapidly as possible so that we can have the impact of saving millions of lives that are lost on the road every year, make the impact of reshaping our cities and making them more livable for humans instead of setting aside a lot of space for cars and make the impact of giving people back billions of hours of their time that they spend stuck behind the wheel of the car every year and make the impact of making transportation more accessible and more affordable for everybody.The scope of the mission that we\u2019re on, however, is very, very significant, and it is not for the faint of heart. Just getting to the minimum viable product, that initial vehicle that can drive more safely than a human is probably the engineering challenge of our generation and it takes a major commitment of resources to get us just to that point in time. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve configured Cruise the way we have over the last few years. We\u2019re assembling a team of thousands of the world\u2019s very best engineers. We\u2019ve put together several billion dollars of capital to support us on the journey. We have very deep integration between Cruise and General Motors and then more recently with Honda as well, and that gives us an ability to not just solve the core technology but to bring a vehicle to the equation that can help in fulfilling the mission. And we have built a number of other strong partnerships to help us on our journey.However, several billion dollars and a few thousand engineers is pretty significant on the one hand, but it\u2019s actually very small scale relative to the magnitude of the commercial opportunity that lays in front of us. It\u2019s not every day that you have an opportunity to bring a truly transformational technology to a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity. And the benefit of approaching a market like transportation is, we know how big this market is. We know that we\u2019re dealing with a multitrillion-dollar opportunity. We know what the existing product in the market is. And we know what we need to build to be better than that existing product. So as we think about the market opportunity, we think about it in four major buckets.The first is moving people. Unsurprisingly, this is the biggest part of the opportunity. And we think on a global basis, the total addressable market that we\u2019re talking about here is a $5 trillion market opportunity. And the approach that we plan to take to that market is to come to market on a fully vertically integrated basis, from the core technology, to the vehicle, to the consumer-facing service. We also see opportunities for selected technology partnerships with other participants in the space. After the opportunity around moving people is the opportunity around moving things, delivery, logistics and so on. I think all of our lives are becoming much more centered around things coming to us rather than us going to them. Delivery, online, e-commerce, all of that is growing at a pretty rapid rate.We think this today is a $2 trillion market opportunity. And the mindset that we have in approaching this market is that we will partner with existing logistics platforms and existing delivery providers and provide them with an AV network and an AV technology stack that will allow them to fulfill their businesses on a much more efficient basis. Beyond the businesses of moving people and moving things, we see significant opportunities around the data insights that we gather from operating our technology. We see significant opportunities around offering consumers experience, user experience when they\u2019re spending time in our vehicles.So any way that you want to slice this, we\u2019re approaching and taking on what is a multi, multitrillion-dollar market opportunity, the business of transportation on the roads of the world. So the question then becomes, quite obviously, how do you take on and make progress against a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity? And so the approach and the mindset that we bring to this is actually incredibly simple. Our goal in the simplest possible terms is to build a superior product. It\u2019s to build a product that is better than what people have as transportation alternatives today.And we think about that on four main dimensions. The first and the most important for us right now is to reach a superhuman level of safety performance, to build a vehicle that can drive more safely than the average human driver in a given operating domain. This is the first big technical threshold to clear, and that\u2019s what a majority of our energy is focused on right now. The second dimension is to build a better user experience, so better for you, right? So safer is great, but if it\u2019s not a better user experience, people aren\u2019t going to use it. So we need to build something that delivers an awesome and consistent and predictable experience rather than the roll of the dice that you have with a lot of transportation alternatives today.The third dimension and the one, I think, that\u2019s had the least focus in the dialogue around self-driving so far is to make this ultra affordable, right? This is perhaps the single biggest lever that we see for unlocking addressable market opportunity is to take the cost of transportation way down relative to what people pay today either to have someone drive for them or to drive themselves. And we think this is the biggest single lever to unlock very large-scale commercial opportunity.And then finally, we need to build something that\u2019s better for the planet, right? We talked about the fundamental problems with transportation today. You heard Mary talk about zero emissions and zero congestion and zero accidents. And this is the technology that can actually unlock and actually deliver to those objectives. So what we\u2019re going to do for the balance of this discussion is go through each of these four product dimensions and discuss how we\u2019re attacking each one of these to build a product that is superior to the transportation alternatives that are on the road for us today.And we have high conviction that we need to be working on all of these things at the same time. Just building technology that can drive more safer than a human doesn\u2019t help you solve this problem at the scale and at the magnitude that we wanted. You need to build the core technology to make it safer. You need to offer a better and more compelling experience. You need to offer that at a really, really attractive price point and do that in a way that you\u2019re actually advancing humankind and making the planet a better place to be.So let\u2019s dive into the core technology dimension of this and the progress that we\u2019re making on building technology that can drive more safely than a human driver, what we like to call superhuman performance, and that\u2019s everything that we\u2019re aiming for. In the core of the AV technology stack, we think about a few different dimensions. We think about the core AV software and the core purpose-built AV hardware. And that\u2019s really the core technology stack, the software and hardware stack. And then we have a second dimension that we think about, which is all of the infrastructure and testing and security that needs to be built around that to enable that core technology stack to improve at the fastest possible rate.And one of the things you\u2019re going to hear repeatedly in the balance of this discussion is our maniacal focus on rate of change and rate of improvement and rate of progress because we\u2019re working on a problem that is measured and dealt with and thinking about exponential issues, not incremental issues.And so as we go forward, I\u2019d like you to sort of suspend the mindset of 5% improvement in sales or two basis point improvements in margins and start to think about rate of change on exponential basis, multiple basis, very big percentage changes because that\u2019s the rate at which everything is moving in the world that we\u2019re operating in here.And at Cruise, we actually think about two major products that we\u2019re working on inside the company from a technology point of view. The first product is, of course, the core AV software and hardware stack. And we have a huge amount of resources committed against that. But the second and equally important and much less obvious product that we\u2019re working on is all of the infrastructure and testing and tools that allows us to make incredibly rapid progress on product number one.And what\u2019s little understood is we actually have many more people, more engineers working on product number two than we do have working on product number one. And all the engineers working on product number two are building infrastructure and tools and testing and security and so on that allow the engineers working on product number one to make incredibly rapid progress. And that\u2019s, I think, a really important point I\u2019d like to emphasize.So we\u2019re also doing the majority of our testing, as most of you know, in downtown San Francisco. You see behind us just sort of some of the day-to-day things that we\u2019re dealing with as we make progress there. And we think testing in these super complex environments is incredibly important because it gives us a really rich experience set. I think these guys, their van broke down. Gives us incredibly rich experience set of things that we encounter every day. So the total distance that you see us drive here in this, I think it\u2019s a 60-second video clip, I think we drive about a quarter of a mile in this video clip.And we drive several thousand miles a day in San Francisco. So you can imagine, take this, multiply it by 10,000, and that\u2019s the kind of experience that we have every single day and the things that we\u2019re seeing, the edge cases that we\u2019re uncovering. And it gives us just an incredibly rich set of information and allows us to make progress in an extremely rapid rate. But it also sort of happens that the dense urban environments not only offer the most technically interesting environment to make rapid progress, but it\u2019s also, obviously, I think, fairly obviously, where the biggest initial commercial opportunity comes.So we\u2019re testing and learning and training in the places that offer the biggest initial commercial opportunity, and we think that\u2019s also incredibly important. So I talked about big changes and big rates of change. We\u2019ve grown Cruise exponentially from the time that General Motors and Cruise came together nearly four years ago, early in 2016. Last year, we grew the organization by about 60%. We now are nearly 1,800 people today inside of Cruise. And north of 75% of everybody at Cruise is an engineer and working on the core engineering problem.So over this time, we\u2019re bringing just an incredibly powerful engineering fire hose, as we call it, of talent and know-how to the problem. And just the resources that we\u2019re bringing to bear every year are growing really dramatically. So 60% growth on that in 2019. This is a company photo from actually April of last year. So it turns out that the number of people in this picture also approximates the number of people that we brought into the organization last year. But it\u2019s not just a numbers game of bringing in amazing talent, but it\u2019s going into \u2013 we\u2019re reaching deep into the biggest technology companies and pulling out the very, very best minds to come and join this mission and to work with us. And we\u2019re incredibly excited about our ability to recruit and retain the very, very best talent and minds to put against this challenge.So what have all those people achieved over the last period of time? And to give you a sense for this idea of rate of progress and rate of change and rate of improvement. So just as one example, we have reduced the time between our major AV software releases by 98% over the course of one year, so a 98% reduction. So that means that we\u2019re releasing about \u2013 it\u2019s about 45x more frequently now than we were about a year ago. So you think about the impact that, that has on our ability to take all of that information that we\u2019re getting from driving in this crazy environment to understand it, learn from it, implement change, put that change in simulation, put that change on the car, see and make sure that we\u2019re continuing to advance at an incredibly rapid rate.So this is just an example of a huge acceleration factor. Another is the testing and simulation frameworks that we\u2019ve built. What you see on one side here is real-life. And what you see on the other side is a simulation of a similar scene. So we take interesting scenes and interesting things we learn about. We drop them into our simulation world that we call The Matrix. And we build really interesting, not just replay of what happened, but it gives us the ability to fork reality at points in time and create alternative scenarios around that, that allow us to learn and not just understand what happened but what else could have happened as we play with time as a dimension, backwards and forwards. So these are incredibly powerful tools that we\u2019ve built, all built entirely in-house. And it\u2019s the intersection and integration of the testing and simulation and the testing and accumulation of learning on the road and having those two things tie together in a really tight way that drives a really powerful rate of progress.Another dimension on the machine learning side, where I think we\u2019re still very much at the relatively early days of the impact that machine learning is going to have on self-driving. It\u2019s a huge part of, obviously, the core of our technology and what we\u2019re doing. But to make this as powerful as possible, we want to improve our models as quickly as we can. And so we\u2019ve had a lot of people working on that product number two side, of the page I showed you earlier, building a machine learning platform that allows us to serve up data and train models at a much, much faster rate than we were doing a year ago.So over the course of one year, we reduced the time that it takes us to train our ML models by more than 80%. And so you can figure out what that does to our overall rate of progress has a really significant impact. So those are just a handful of examples of things that we\u2019re doing to drive a faster and faster rate of development and faster and faster rate of progress as we get out onto the longer sort of longer tail of this challenge of building a vehicle that can drive with superhuman performance. And so you may be sitting there saying, well, that\u2019s kind of interesting, but tell me kind of where you are on this journey, how far along are you? And how far do you have left to go to get to that initial superhuman performance threshold?So taking all of those things that we\u2019ve put together, increased engineering resources, all of the tools, infrastructure, testing, rate of change and so on, we\u2019ve been able to sustain for about four years now about a 10x improvement every year in our performance against our core safety metric. And again, this is the metric that we\u2019re most focused on because that\u2019s the thing that we need to clear to deliver the superhuman level of performance.So, think about a 10x rate of change, think about doing that year in and year out for four years now, that adds up fairly quickly. Multiply that out, that\u2019s a 10,000x improvement in performance over four years. So I asked you to suspend percentage thinking and to think about order of magnitude thinking, 10,000x improvement, four orders of magnitude performance improvement over the last number of years.And while we\u2019re not going to share with you today our internal metrics on this, you can look at some of the external metrics that are out there, particularly the California DMV Very difficult to do comparisons across companies with this data, but it can be a useful signal for rate of change of what companies are doing. And if you look at that data for Cruise over the last four years, it also suggests about a 10,000x rate of improvement and also suggests roughly 10x a year in terms of how that rate of change is coming on.Again, this is not the data that we actually rely on, but it\u2019s an external indicator that\u2019s out there that can give you a clue as to the overall rate of progress. So really, really significant progress in a very \u2013 we\u2019re getting into a very steep exponential ramp at this point in time. And interestingly, we\u2019ve done that while dramatically increasing the complexity of the operating domain that we\u2019re working in. You go back to the beginning of 2016, we were driving a handful of fixed routes around SoMa in San Francisco. We\u2019re now driving every day the entire 7x7 of San Francisco, every street, every block and covering incredibly complex terrain.So while we\u2019ve expanded the operating domain and significantly increased the complexity of what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve also made really dramatic progress on our core safety metrics here proxied by this external data.So putting all that together, you can think about this as kind of two exponential forces working against each other. On the one hand, we\u2019re getting out on the very long tail of this problem, and we\u2019ve been expanding the operating domain and increasing the complexity. And so we have an exponentially more difficult thing that we\u2019re trying to solve each instance of time, each period of time.On the other hand, we\u2019re bringing exponentially more powerful tools and resources to that equation. And so you\u2019ve got these two very powerful forces working \u2013 taking the forces to try and solve this increasingly complex challenge. And so we\u2019ve made every year an order of magnitude or a 10x, an order of magnitude improvement every year over the last four years. We have less than one order of magnitude of improvement to go to get to superhuman performance in this environment. And so we\u2019re getting in the zone. We\u2019re getting relatively close to approaching that level of performance.So the next obvious question you might ask was, well, tell us exactly when that\u2019s going to happen, which I can\u2019t do. And the reason I can\u2019t do that is because the nature of these forces working against each other, exponentially more challenging, exponentially more powerful tools, it\u2019s very hard to predict exactly how those are going to intersect and how long this is going to take. The progress that we\u2019ve made has been dramatic and over a longer period of time, pretty consistent.Inside of that, there\u2019s obviously noise, right? We\u2019re working on something that has never been done before so it\u2019s inherently impossible to predict exactly how that\u2019s going to unfold. But we are getting right in the zone and we\u2019re making really dramatic progress and we\u2019re bringing really, really powerful tools to the last long tail piece of this equation so we feel very good about where we are relative to that superhuman overall threshold.So that gives you a sense for where we are on the core technology, progress towards the superhuman threshold. But as I said, that\u2019s really just one part of the overall equation. We also need to build an experience that is better, better for you as a user, something that\u2019s consistent and something that\u2019s predictable. So to that end, while we\u2019ve been working on core technology, in parallel, we\u2019ve got a huge team of Cruise, General Motors engineers, Honda engineers working on the Cruise Origin, which is the vehicle that we unveiled a couple of weeks ago in San Francisco.And what the Cruise Origin brings to the table is this massive enabler of a really great user experience and doing that in an ultra low cost, and I\u2019ll come back to the cost in a minute. But the point is, we want to be able to deliver people a very predictable, very consistent, really awesome experience. And one of the things we really want to unlock with the Cruise Origin is to make shared rides not suck, right? Shared rides today aren\u2019t great. Anyone who\u2019s taken shared rides knows that it\u2019s not a tremendous experience. We believe that to improve congestion in our cities and to reduce space taken up by cars in our cities, we need to make shared rides a compelling experience. And so that\u2019s been a huge sort of central theme as we\u2019ve been designing the Origin.And so the interior experience in here, we\u2019ve unlocked a ridiculous amount of space in this vehicle by taking out all of the stuff that you don\u2019t need in a regular car by taking out the driver controls and the internal combustion engine and the gas tank and all of these other things that a normal car has taking up space. We pulled all of that out.And so in the space of a pretty limited vehicle footprint, we\u2019ve built an incredibly spacious interior, a really great user experience. And when you sit in this \u2013 and all of you will have this opportunity \u2013 you\u2019ll get a sense for, I\u2019d be happy to share a ride in here because I got tons of space between me, the person next to me, I\u2019m nowhere near close to the person across from me. And if we can do all that with a great experience at a super low cost will really increase the amount of shared transportation which we think is incredibly important to reach the societal goals that we have.But in addition to working on the core technology and on the vehicle, we\u2019re also developing the totality of the product experience for the user. We\u2019re doing this today with an internal rideshare program at Cruise. All of our employees have the Cruise app on their phone. And they\u2019re using our vehicles every day to get around, to get to and from work or elsewhere. And what that\u2019s giving us is real-world experience and learning on some things that sound basic but are actually really difficult to learn and optimize. Ride quality, it\u2019s not just can I drive more safely than a human, it\u2019s can I drive like a human or in a human-like way and in a way that\u2019s not surprising or hard to predict for people.How do you dispatch these vehicles? How do you estimate ETAs for them to get where they go? What does the routing look like? Does it look similar or different to the routing of a human-driven vehicle? How does the trip time compare? How do they pick up and drop off? How is that going to work? How does customer assistance engage? How are we going to engage with someone who wants help or wants to talk with somebody when they\u2019re in their car? So there\u2019s all of these other product areas that are getting worked on in parallel, in parallel with the vehicle and in parallel with the core technology.Similarly, on the business of moving things, away from moving people, we\u2019re in a pilot partnership with DoorDash at the moment. We have other pilots that are under discussion and development. And what this is teaching us about is, how do we partner with another company on a B2B basis? What does that integration look like? How does that work? What are we learning about vehicle configuration and user behavior and technology integration and so on? So while, again, we\u2019re working on all of these mainstream things, we\u2019re doing these other learnings and other pilot programs along the side in parallel.So we\u2019ve talked about core technology that\u2019s superhuman from a safety point of view. We talked about building a better experience and the Cruise Origin is a huge unlock of that. Let\u2019s talk about affordability because this is probably, like I said, the biggest single lever to get us where we want to get to. This is the economics of the rideshare business as it exists today. You can all look at the public filings of these companies. And what we know is that the customer pays money and the vast majority of that money does not go to the transportation company, it goes to the driver for them to cover their cost of their time, vehicle, everything else.Then there\u2019s the cost of running the business, the incentives for drivers and passengers, cost of operations, R&D, customer support, all of those things. And the economics of that business, even at the scale that it\u2019s grown to today, result in a loss on a unit economic basis. We believe that the economics of the business that we\u2019re building, of the product that we\u2019re building will be fundamentally different. And they\u2019ll be fundamentally different in the beginning. But more importantly, they will change at a really rapid rate over time.So it\u2019s not hard to imagine that we should be able to offer a product at a lower price to the user than rideshare today but take all of that for us as revenue because we\u2019re not sharing it with someone who has to run their vehicle and so on. We take that money and obviously cover the costs of the fleet and the depreciation and the operations and the infrastructure and the engineering and all of the things that are required to support that.But all of our modeling tells us today that even in the early days, even in the early days of this, we should be able to demonstrate positive unit economics. But more importantly than demonstrating that initially is we have very high conviction that we can demonstrate an extraordinarily rapid rate of change in the unit economics over time. And that we know what the drivers are on the cost curve to take us down to a place where this gets really, really interesting as I\u2019ll expand on here.So again, back to this mindset of significant change reshaping and rethinking the way things are done today and big reductions in cost. So let\u2019s talk about the first one which is the Cruise Origin. Not only do we need to be better than the current transportation alternatives that are on the road today, we also need to be much more cost competitive than whatever other AV offerings could potentially be out there at that time. And so everything that we\u2019ve done around the Origin has been built around two things : one, an awesome experience; and two, the ability to deliver this at an ultra low cost.And so a handful of the key attributes of the Origin that allow that are a useful life of over 1 million miles, which is more than 6 times more than your average car. And that\u2019s enabled by the fact that we\u2019ve built the vehicle to be extraordinarily modular so we can upgrade and rev hardware and technology incredibly quickly and easily. We can replace parts that are worn and upgrade interiors and so on incredibly quickly. And so you should think about this as much more of an aircraft MRO kind of operating model than running a traditional vehicle on the road. So really a long useful life, really high degree of modularity, all-electric, huge and obvious enabler for cost, right? Like the idea that you\u2019re going to build the future of transportation and have it not be all-electric is just preposterous. So clearly, that\u2019s a huge advantage.And then finally, on the BoM cost side, and this is the thing that I think surprised a lot of people when we revealed the Origin a couple of weeks ago, is that we are able to build this vehicle at an incredibly low total cost, not just the base vehicle, but everything that goes into it from a technology point of view as well and able to rev that significantly over time. So huge, huge cost advantage for us in the Cruise Origin. Away from the base vehicle itself and then we start to talk about the compute and the sensors and so on.Unsurprisingly, probably, there\u2019s just massive change in costs going on. On this dimension, the chart here shows our compute cost reduction plan. We are developing multiple generations of compute architecture in parallel. We have a generation that\u2019s on the car today. We\u2019re building now the early builds of our next generation that\u2019s going to go into the vehicles this year. We have under very active development the generation that will be the first gen that goes into the Cruise Origin when it starts production. And the cost reduction between what\u2019s in the cars today and what will go into the Cruise Origin on Day 1 is an 85% reduction in compute cost. So this, again, it\u2019s not a 5% or a 10% tweak. It\u2019s a huge, basically, an order of magnitude change in cost reduction as we move forward there.Very similar story on the sensor side, sensor suite, it\u2019s the same kind of level of activity and change going on in innovation and optimization of sensors, really exciting on that front as well. On the operational side, so we\u2019re running a fleet today. We run a fleet, obviously, for mileage accumulation to learn the kinds of things you saw in the little video there. We run the fleet for the rideshare service that we offer to our employees.And so we\u2019re learning a lot about even at sort of 100 scale like running \u2013 what it means to run a fleet and how you drive utilization. Between last summer and now, we\u2019ve had a pretty significant increase in utilization. We\u2019ll have another step change in that this year. And between last summer and the end of this year, we\u2019ll have a 2.5x increase in our utilization rate. So again, these are things that are moving incredibly rapidly and having a huge impact on our rate of progress.Infrastructure, we get a lot of questions on, well, how much charging infrastructure do you need? What\u2019s that going to cost? That feels like an expensive thing. We already operate, by far, the largest charging infrastructure setup in the Bay Area in totality. We have very significant learnings going on, on this side. And our infrastructure team, working with our vendors on the charger side have been able to realize already between 2017 and the chargers that we\u2019re installing in our new charging location right now, an 85% reduction in cost per kilowatt of charging capacity.So again, these are huge percentage reductions just moving these numbers really, really dramatically. And the reason all of that matters and the reason all of that is important is back to this point, that to unlock the market opportunity, we need to figure out how to drive costs down, not just initially, that\u2019s important, but how we drive costs down at a really significant way, at a very high rate of change over a very long period of time.So let\u2019s talk about what commercialization can look like in the early days and how it could unfold over time. If you take the City of San Francisco and you take just the existing rideshare business that goes on in that city today. From a customer pay point of view, we think that\u2019s about a $3 billion market today in terms of what customers are handing over to take rides in cars today. And that\u2019s happening at about $3.75, somewhere between $3 and $4 a mile average cost in terms of what customers are paying.And so you got a $3 billion market happening at $3 to $4 a mile. And if we show up with a product that is safer and a better experience and lower cost, we believe we will take a meaningful chunk of that market. So it\u2019s not hard to imagine that just based on one city and one earlier version of product, you could build a $1 billion business out of that. That\u2019s step number one.Then let\u2019s say that we expanded that to the top five rideshare markets. That\u2019s about a $15 billion business today in terms of what customers are paying to take rideshare rides in those markets today. So now let\u2019s say we take a meaningful share of that business because we\u2019ve got a product that\u2019s safer and better and cheaper for people to use. So now you\u2019ve built a several billion-dollar business based on five markets. And to do that, you\u2019re talking about tens of thousands of cars. You\u2019re not talking about hundreds of thousands of cars; you\u2019re talking about tens of thousands of Cruise Origins deployed in those markets.Then if we expand to the rideshare business as we know it today in the United States, that\u2019s roughly just under a $50 billion customer pay business today. Once you get outside of the most dense urban environments, the price point comes down today. So it\u2019s about a \u2013 more of a $2 a mile business on average, we think. By the time that we\u2019re scaling into this market opportunity, we will have made dramatically more progress on the cost curves that I showed you earlier, extending that rate of improvement and rate of change that we\u2019ve had there. Then get it down to $1 a mile starts to get really interesting.So, what happens at that point in time is you now, you\u2019ve left rideshare and you\u2019re now approaching the cost of owning and operating your own car. So if you own and operate your own car and you drive 8,000 miles a year or less, cost you $1 a mile to do that. So now we get to the point where we can deliver an awesome experience, safer than a human, and we can deliver that at a cost that\u2019s competitive with the cost of driving your own car and we give you back the time for free.So the time you spent behind the wheel, you get back. This is a $500 billion market. And then you can go further and say, what if we get it down to $0.60, which is the average cost of car ownership in the United States, turns out that\u2019s a $1 trillion market. So apply whatever market share you think you might get from that and now you\u2019ve built a really big business. And then if you go back to the market opportunity I showed you at the beginning and you take it global and you add in delivery and logistics and in-car experience and data monetization, you grow the market opportunity again.So the point here is, we\u2019re bringing an extremely disruptive transformational technology to a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity, and we can begin that in the places where the economics make the most compelling sense. And we can scale that. And even out of the gates, we\u2019re building an interesting size business, but the opportunity beyond that is really, really significant.So safer, better, more affordable but there\u2019s also this dimension of having a positive impact on the planet. If you go back to where I began talking about the cost of transportation being too high in terms of lives lost and money spent and time wasted and the impact on the environment, we\u2019re not going to \u2013 the center of that is the fact that in the United States today, more than 75% of us still drive to work in a gasoline-powered car by ourselves. And until we change that equation and until we move people to all-electric and until we move people to shared transportation and until we take the human out of the loop on the driving task, we\u2019re not going to solve those fundamental issues around transportation.So a few fun facts to think about on framing that. In the United States today, the car parc, there\u2019s about 270 million cars in the United States today. There\u2019s somewhere between, no one knows precisely, there\u2019s somewhere between 1 billion and 2 billion parking spots in the United States. So every car has somewhere between 4 or 6 or 4 and 8 parking spaces attached to it. And you all as financial types can think about it this way. That\u2019s a $4 trillion investment in vehicles that are used about 5% of the time and it\u2019s a $4 trillion investment in real estate to park those vehicles on for the other 95% of the time that we\u2019re not using them. So think about the inefficiency and inherent cost that comes with that from a financial point of view, but also just the amount of space that it takes up in our cities, the cost of all of that.We think this self-driving technology deployed in this mode is probably the most powerful lever we have to radically increase the share of miles traveled that are electrified. Obviously, bringing EVs to market and scaling that will be important, but driving it on a very, very high utilization framework is really important as well. And then it\u2019s giving people back the time that we all spend stuck behind the wheel in traffic. And then there\u2019s the human cost. Over the last decade \u2013 we don\u2019t have 2019 numbers yet \u2013 so from 2010 to 2018, so nine years, more than 300,000 lives lost on the roads of the United States. So think about the human cost of all of that.Our aspiration, initial aspiration, is to get to a superhuman level of performance to be measurably better than a human driver so we can deploy this technology and make the roads slightly better by doing that. But that\u2019s just the beginning. Our goal of 10x improvement every year is going to continue long after that point in time. And our aspiration is get to the point where the number is as close to zero as possible. And that may sound far-fetched and far away but I\u2019d point you to another mode of transportation that we all use all the time that\u2019s pretty close to that. Commercial airlines in the United States in the last nine years, one fatality. And there\u2019s no reason that we shouldn\u2019t be aiming for that kind of aspiration on the roads in the vehicles that we\u2019re using every single day. And so that is our safety aspiration.So let me leave you with a few thoughts. It\u2019s my view that the societal forces at work that make transportation today so costly for us make it inevitable this technology will be deployed at very large scale. It\u2019s in my view, completely inevitable that that\u2019s going to happen. Next point, the barriers to entry to what we\u2019re doing are extraordinarily high. There are very few companies that have assembled the talent and the financial resources and the partnerships and the integration with OEMs that is necessary to have a chance of making this work and making it work with large-scale. So the field is thinning out really quickly in terms of companies that are on a track to actually make this happen a big scale.The next thing I\u2019d leave you with is that the core technology, MVP is entirely a win not if, discussion. And I talked about the timing of the interplay of these exponential forces and how that\u2019s going to \u2013 how those are going to offset and why that makes very specific timing difficult to predict but I think I gave you a pretty clear sense of how close we are and what\u2019s likely involved in this last step to get to that initial superhuman level of performance.The market opportunity is measurable and known and is measured in trillions of dollars, right? We know how big the market is. We know what the existing products in the market are, we can measure them on experience and cost and safety. And so we know what the thresholds are to build a product that\u2019s better than those things, and all of our energy is going to do that. So this isn\u2019t a \u2013 let\u2019s build it and \u2013 let thing. We know what the existing product is and we know what we need to do to build something that\u2019s better than that.I\u2019ll tell you that the regulatory backdrop is fairly constructive. NHTSA and DOT are being fairly clear in communicating their desire to see this happen. And so we feel fairly good from a regulatory point of view. The investment required in dollar versus the upside potential. We talked about \u2013 this is a multibillion-dollar activity, and that in and of itself is a barrier to entry, but it\u2019s a multibillion-dollar investment to unlock a multitrillion dollar market opportunity. And so from an ROI or potential upside relative to investment, it\u2019s a hugely powerful division.And so the final thing I\u2019d leave you with is that we have extremely high conviction in the impact that this technology is going to have and we have extremely high conviction in the impact that this technology is going to have and we have extremely high conviction on the rate of progress therefore making, and we are very much in execution mode. Thank you. Rocky Gupta : Okay. So I have a feeling that this is the kind of crowd that likes to see numbers after lunch. So the finance guy and an engineer that warms my heart, so let\u2019s get seated back again. What we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll have a short video and followed by that, we\u2019ll have Dhivya Suryadevara. Dhivya Suryadevara : Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone, for being here today. So in my section, I\u2019d like to talk about two main topics. Firstly, I want to talk about our calendar year 2019 performance and our outlook for 2020; I want to give you more color on that. And importantly, I want to pull together what you heard today and give you a framework on how to think about our business in my second part of the presentation.So let\u2019s get started. 2019 was an eventful year. We had a share of challenges, but I also think we had a number of opportunities that we capitalized on that allowed us to deliver the results that we did. So let\u2019s take a quick look at what worked and what some of the challenges were.You heard a lot about trucks today and crossovers and the performance of our new launches. That was an important tailwind as we think about our performance in 2019. The cost savings we announced in November of 2018 remain on track. In fact, in the calendar year 2019, we were ahead of track and we remain on track for the rest of the calendar year 2020 to deliver what we committed to.GM Financial was a bright spot from a performance standpoint. The business continues to grow and generate record levels of profitability. And finally, from a cultural standpoint, I\u2019ve been talking to you about cash and cash conversion for about a year now. And I think the results we have demonstrated and what we predict for 2020, I think really demonstrate the commitment of the entire team on this very important metric. And I\u2019ll talk more about that later in the presentation.Let\u2019s talk about the challenges. The strike had a meaningful impact on 2019 results. The China business you heard Matt talk about today and what we\u2019re doing there to get that business back on track. South America was volatile \u2013 more volatile than what we predicted at the beginning of the year. And you heard Steve talk about the steps we\u2019re taking there as well.I think the takeaway is, relative to what I talked to you about a year ago, there were a number of puts and takes. But the underlying business remains exceptionally strong and that\u2019s what takes us into 2020 with a strong outlook.Let\u2019s look at the actual results, the numbers. EPS, we delivered $4.82 against an outlook of $4.50 to $4.80. And from a cash flow standpoint, we generated $1.1 billion against our guidance of zero to $1 billion.Now, I think it\u2019s important to also look at these results on a strike adjusted basis because it will help frame our 2020 performance and it will allow you to look at apples-to-apples comparisons. From an EPS standpoint, we generated $6.71 on a strike adjusted basis. You may remember our original guidance last year, $6.50 to $7, so in line with our original guidance one year ago. Free cash flow, we generated $6.5 billion of cash, excluding the impact of the strike. And when you compare that against our original guidance of $4.5 billion to $6 billion, it was clearly a strong performance that demonstrates our focus in this important area.I would like to quickly touch on regional performance before we move to 2020. North America had a strong performance, up $1 billion year-over-year. And that\u2019s primarily due to our launches, the strong performance of trucks, crossovers and cost savings. That helped offset international weakness around the globe. You see GMI on this page. That was primarily China down $800 million year-over-year, offset by international operations, excluding China, up $200 million year-over-year.GM Financial, as I talked about, grew earnings and stood at $2.1 billion for calendar year 2019. Cruise and Corp sectors performed in line with expectations.So the takeaway from this slide, excluding the impact of the strike, strong performance, especially in North America and GM Financial Operations.So let\u2019s get into 2020. Before I get into the numbers, I want to frame for you the macro picture around the globe. We are predicting continued volatility in all of our key operating areas. In the U.S., we\u2019re expecting a mid-16 million light vehicle industry which is down about 0.5 million units compared to 2019. In China, as Matt talked about, we do expect a decline in industry, about 1 million units, prior to the impact of coronavirus.Clearly, as Mary talked about, how the virus impact evolves would have an impact on 2020 performance, not just from a demand perspective, but potentially the global supply chain as well. And the whole team is working diligently to have contingency plans in place should this become a more serious situation.In South America, we\u2019re expecting FX pressures to continue into 2020. You all see where the Brazilian real is and you see where the Argentine peso is. Those are the two main currencies that impact our operations in South America. And we\u2019re expecting in 2020 that those challenges will continue and we\u2019re managing our operations despite the volatility that we expect so that we are on a path to profitability irrespective of the FX environment.Commodities have been up and down, and you\u2019ve seen steel and aluminum have backed off somewhat. But importantly, palladium and rhodium have been up significantly since December. Especially rhodium was up close to 100%; palladium and other 40%, and that\u2019s causing a significant headwind as well from a macro standpoint.Next, I want to talk about key drivers before I get into numbers. I just covered macro and regulatory, which will be the biggest headwind that we\u2019re seeing in 2020. Way against that our specific performance, the factors that are specific to GM, whether it\u2019s launches or a full year of heavy-duty and light-duty and the cost savings that we have coming up \u2013 remaining from our $4 billion to $4.5 billion target that we\u2019ve set out for ourselves, they contribute favorably to 2020 performance.I also want to talk for a minute about strike and strike recovery. In a normal environment, excluding the impact of the strike, when you see the industry go down, we will have had to take inventory down. Because of the strike, we have effectively overcorrected for the situation and we\u2019re building back dealer inventory, subject to the capacity constraints that we have on our vehicle lines. Mary and I talked about this last quarter that we\u2019re constrained from a capacity standpoints on some of our key vehicle lines. And the team is working together to get every unit we can across all of these, and you can see some of the results from a tailwind standpoint, offsetting the macro impact that we\u2019re expecting in 2020.Now, obviously the industry level and the strike recovery is a toggle. If you see a higher industry, our ability to recover strike will be lower and vice versa. So we\u2019ll keep you updated on that as we go through the rest of the calendar year.So the takeaways from this page, the first negative is offset fully by GM specific performance as well as lean inventory balancing out to about zero. So let\u2019s get into the numbers.Our EPS diluted adjusted range this year is in the range of $5.75 to $6.25. To put it in context, we\u2019re expecting an impact from non-operating items of about $0.55 per share. What are these non-operating items? We\u2019ve talked about tax rate normalizing to a more sustainable level. 2019 was abnormally low. We\u2019ve talked about interest income being lower because of our cash balance. And as in every year, we are not expecting any tailwind or headwind from our investments in Lyft and PSA, so that it neutralizes the impact of that and it allows you to look at our operating performance and focus on the core performance here.From a free cash flow standpoint, we\u2019re expecting $6 billion to $7.5 billion, despite the impact of the challenges that I talked about from a macro standpoint, and I will be walking for you both the EPS and the free cash flow in the next couple of pages. Before I do that, let me give you a run around the world from a regional outlook standpoint.With all the actions we\u2019ve talked about the new launches and cost savings, we expect North America to be up year-over-year on a strike adjusted basis. So if you exclude the impact of strike, North American performance was strong in 2019. We expect it to be better in 2020.In China, we expect continued industry and regulatory headwinds, as Matt talked about earlier. Clearly, with the virus situation, we expect a meaningfully lower equity income in China in the first quarter of 2020. And once the situation resolves, we\u2019re expecting an equity income in the range of about $200 million on a quarterly basis \u2013 on a run rate basis after the situation gets to be more stable one.GM International, up slightly as a result of the number of actions that Steve talked about and the new launches that are happening in the region. GM Financial continues to grow their earning assets, but we expect residual values to normalize in 2020 and as a result their earnings to be flat to slightly down, but that would depend a lot on what\u2019s happening with residual values on a year-over-year basis.I want to talk about cadence as well for a minute. As in the last several years, H2 we expect to be meaningfully stronger than H1, and, as I mentioned in China, the early part of the year to be weaker than the latter half of the year. So from a total company standpoint, the outlook for EBIT is flat despite the macro headwinds that I talked about. So let\u2019s get into this in a little bit more detail.I\u2019d like to walk for you the impact of all of these three factors that I talked about, starting from EPS diluted adjusted for calendar year 2019 at $6.71 that I talked about. You first layer on macro headwinds, US-China, commodities and GMF. So that\u2019s the biggest headwind that we are expecting in 2020. But against that, the net impact of GM specific factors, as I talked about in the prior page, is a positive. There are some puts and takes within that column.The biggest tailwind that we see in 2020 from a GM specific performance is the full-size SUV transition. And we\u2019ve talked about this before, how we expect to take downtime, and the ramp-up on our full-size SUVs with the level of change in the vehicles as well as the brand new architecture and three brands coming out of one architecture in one plant, we have major changeover related downtime. And we expect to see that to be the headwind that is on a GM specific basis that\u2019s most meaningful.I talk to you about depreciation every year. This is secularly going up as catching up to the levels of CapEx that we\u2019ve had historically. On the positive side, launches and HDs continue to be strong, cost savings that I mentioned. And given the interest rate environment we\u2019re in, a small tailwind as well from pension standpoint.I talked about strike recovery. A simple way to think about it, we expect to build about 80,000 units from a dealer inventory standpoint between year-end 2019 and year-end 2020. So you put all this together, EPS \u2013 EBIT roughly flat from the impact of operating items. And the new layer on top of that, the non-operating items, and that gets you to our EPS diluted adjusted outlook for the year.Let\u2019s talk about cash flow. We generated $6.5 billion on a strike adjusted basis in 2019. The biggest headwind we see on cash flow is predictable, it\u2019s the impact of China dividend and the earnings \u2013 the year-over-year decline between 2018 and 2019 because China dividends are paid on a one-year lag basis. So that\u2019s $800 million coming out of China dividends declining from 2018 to 2019. But that headwind is more than offset by some of the tailwinds that we see. I talked about CapEx and CapEx normalization. We anticipate about $7 billion approximately in CapEx and in 2019 we achieved $7.5 billion. So there is a $500 million tailwind coming from CapEx.GMF dividends are expected to roughly double in calendar year 2020. They paid $400 million, approximately, in 2019, and you see that roughly doubling \u2013 we see that roughly doubling in 2020. Put all this together, we see growth in free cash flow, and it gets you to the range of $6 billion to $7.5 billion that we talked about.I also want to touch on the cash flow trajectory as well as cash conversion and give you a sense beyond 2020 of what to expect. When we first talked to you about cash conversion at the end of 2018, we were generating about $4 billion cash flow level, and that was approximately 44% conversion from a net income to cash flow basis. With the results in 2019, strike adjusted at $6.5 billion, it takes our conversion up to about 62%. And with the outlook we\u2019ve talked about in calendar year 2020 that takes our conversion to 65% to 70%. And you might wonder, when does that get to a close to 100%, and you\u2019ve been talking about 100%.And if you think about the tailwinds and headwinds we\u2019ve had from a cash flow standpoint, the biggest tailwind we expect beyond 2020 has been GM Financial dividends, the rest of their earnings to the parent. And I\u2019ll talk about that in a few slides on what that potential could be.And from an earnings standpoint, I\u2019ve also talked about depreciation and pension income and those will be earnings headwinds, but we expect to \u2013 we\u2019ll continue to work to offset that with true cash earnings as well, which will bring our conversion to an 80% to 90% level in the 2023 to 2025 time frame. Why not 100% yet? The pension does have a long tail and the payments follow the benefit payments \u2013 the schedule that retirees have set out. So that\u2019s the story here, and I think this is an important slide because this showcases for you why this is an important priority and how we\u2019re working to get that to the levels that we\u2019ve talked about before.Okay. I want to touch briefly on operating efficiencies. We\u2019re on target to hit the CapEx levels that I talked about before, $7 billion in 2020, approximately. And from a cost savings standpoint, through calendar year 2019 we have achieved $3.3 billion of efficiencies. So, we have about $1 billion left to go in 2020. So, we remain on track and wanted to give you a quick update on that.Let\u2019s talk about capital allocation. So, you have all that cash and what are we going to do with it? So from a free cash flow standpoint, you can see on this page, I talked about the $6 billion to $7.5 billion, which is really the net of operating cash flow and the CapEx that you see on this page. So, we have free cash flow of $6 billion to $7.5 billion. We also have potential source from selling non-operating assets like our investment in Lyft, which we\u2019ve been opportunistically selling and we expect to continue to do that.In terms of uses of cash, you see that on the top right of the page. The strike has depleted our cash balance, and as you know, we have talked about that in the last earnings call, and we\u2019re now working on replenishing that cash balance back to our target of $18 billion on an average basis. So, we expect to use about $2 billion to $3 billion of our free cash flow towards our investment grade balance sheet, which brings us to return on capital to shareholders. We expect to keep dividends at the same level of about $2 billion, which leaves $2 billion to $3 billion for share buybacks and other potential uses.Now, Steve talked about how we\u2019re continuing to work on getting GMI to profitability. To that end, if we see compelling restructuring opportunities in GMI with an appropriate payback period, we will likely use a portion of this cash for that purpose, with the rest of the remaining cash going towards share buybacks, and we will keep you posted on that as we go through the calendar year.To summarize 2020, improvement in operating performance will likely offset macro headwinds. And again, this is a differentiator in our view. This demonstrates our commitment that macro headwinds might come and things might happen from time to time, but this team remains focused on executing our plan. Improvement in cash flow and cash conversion, and expect to return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.Before I go to the second section, I want to talk for a moment about execution. What you see on this page is proof points of different things from a financial metric perspective that we\u2019ve committed to, and I want to really use that as a foundation to frame our 2020 performance. Yes, we will likely see different headwinds or tailwinds that we have not predicted at the beginning of this calendar year. But this team, as we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019re committed to delivering on our objectives in 2020 and beyond.With that, let me take you to the second section where I\u2019d like to pull together what you heard from all the other speakers and give you a framework on how to think about our various collection of businesses.Firstly, we have a collection of highly profitable cash generative businesses where we have a leadership position, and you see all of those listed on this page. I\u2019m going to talk about each of them in the following pages. We do have a few turnaround opportunities, especially on the international side. And finally, you\u2019ve heard a lot about AV and EV today, and we consider those businesses accretive from our core, given our unique positioning. So, let\u2019s quickly talk about each of these.Trucks. Mary talked about how this is an important business for us and how we\u2019re growing this and we are proud of our product and our performance in this area. So, let me frame this up for you in terms of how important is this for the company. Over half the revenues in North America come from trucks, $65 billion of revenue. And from a margin standpoint, we expect this to be in the mid to high teens. And hopefully, that gives you an additional insight on the attractiveness of this business. And I\u2019ve talked previously about how we think this business is different from the rest of the light vehicle market. And a quick recap of the points that we made on that topic.We believe there is pent-up demand in this sector, which is likely to continue as a tailwind from a demand standpoint for the next several years. A proof point for you is the growth we have seen in the last few years. In the past five years alone, this segment has grown about 6% on an annualized basis. Compare that with the rest of the industry where we\u2019ve seen a decline of about 50 basis points. So again, this is a segment where because of the age of the fleet, the installed base and the growth that we\u2019ve seen here, we do expect a healthy level of demand to continue in the foreseeable future.I talked about how the margins are attractive and Barry talked about how we\u2019re the only OEM with two brands and we\u2019re positioned really well with both the Chevrolet and the GMC brand. I want to remind you of the competitive moats that exist in this sector as well. Historically, over 90% of the sales in this sector has been through the top three OEMs. Compare that with the rest of the light vehicle industry where that\u2019s less than 40%.We do \u2013 you might ask, well, aren\u2019t there new disruptors coming in. And that\u2019s where the next point comes in, which is really important where we believe the battery electric trucks that we will build will leverage the success that we\u2019ve had in the ICE business. This is a business that we\u2019ve done for over 100 years. We know the customers well, and we have an outstanding distribution channel, and we do not intend to cede our leadership position in this very important segment.Next, I\u2019d like to talk about GM Financial, which is another cash generative business that earns an appropriate return on its capital. Before we talk about GM Financial\u2019s financial contribution, I\u2019d like to talk about what it brings to the auto industry and the auto side of the business. We had in calendar year 2019 alone over two million leads to our dealers generated through GMF, so clearly very important. From a loyalty standpoint, as a data point, over 78% leased loyalty. So what that basically means, over 78% of the customers come back to GMF to buy a GM vehicle. And as you know, conquests are much more expensive than retaining a customer. So this allows us to strengthen the vehicle sales and help with demand there as well.Financing through the cycle is critical. We recognize we\u2019re in a cyclical industry, and GMF provides hard to finance customers with financing as the industry does turn. So put it altogether, this business generates return on equity in the range of low-to-mid teens, an appropriate level of return for this kind of a business. And let\u2019s talk about how it\u2019s been growing over the last several years.From 2015, when we made the decision to grow this to be a full captive FinCo to 2019, we\u2019ve seen a significant growth and we sit just shy of $100 billion from an earning assets perspective, quite significant. And in the next several years, as we improve penetration and it continues to grow, we expect the level to be around \u2013 the assets to tail off around $125 billion. And from an earnings standpoint, we expect a corresponding growth in our earnings as well with EBT in the range of about $2.5 billion in the next several years. And as I talked about from a cash conversion standpoint, we do expect that the net income coming out of this business will be dividend-ed back to the parent in the 2023 to 2025 timeframe, again, very important business for us.Let\u2019s quickly touch on after sales, which is another important business and cash generative business for GM. This has been a consistent profit contributor, and we expect it to be a consistent profit contributor going forward. This business is less cyclical than the rest of the business. And this is a growth opportunity as the car park continues to age and it sits at about 11.7 years today. The service business for trucks is particularly attractive and it\u2019s over 2x that of passenger cars. So, when you take the strong truck business, it translates into a strong after-sales business as well. The margins are very strong in this business as well and it keeps the customer in our ecosystem, which is very important. Translates into a high ROIC business overall.I want to talk finally about connectivity, which is an important piece of a franchise, which is profitable and cash generative. This includes OnStar with the safety and security features. It includes remote access and other subscription businesses that we have. Up until 2016, this business was losing customers and subscribers, and we had made a conscious decision in 2016 to turn this around and have this be a growth area. And you can see the results of that. And in 2020, we expect to have about 12 million paying subscribers in this business. And in the future, we expect that this would grow, and the drivers of growth, obviously we get growth with GM customers, we get growth through our fleet business as well where fleet intel is an important aspect for that category of customers.From a partnership standpoint, there is many examples of things that we\u2019ve already rolled out, whether it\u2019s Amazon and package delivery or marketplace. But we\u2019re just scratching the surface in terms of how much more subscription-based businesses we can have which are high margin and just have a different kind of a revenue profile than the rest of our business. And I\u2019m going to talk about subscriptions later in the presentation as well. So that summarizes the cash generative portion of the franchises that we\u2019re proud of, and they fuel the growth in a lot of the growth areas that we\u2019ve talked about today.Let\u2019s turn to the turnaround opportunities. Steve Kiefer talked about GM International. So, I\u2019m not going to repeat all of that. But that does represent a $2 billion improvement when you get the margin levels from where they were in 2018 to an appropriate level of margins, which in this business we think is mid-single digit, so a tailwind coming from restructuring of this operation.And finally, from a luxury standpoint, Mark talked a lot about this today. This is a business that\u2019s historically struggled in the United States and performed really well in China. And with all the exciting plans that we shared earlier today, with a refreshed product portfolio and improved segment coverage, we expect that this business will grow not only in China, but in the United States as well. And we\u2019ve talked about how this is our leading brand from an EV standpoint. And so this will attract a new generation of customers that the Cadillac brand currently doesn\u2019t have to the brand.So we talked about cash generative businesses and turnaround opportunities. I want to talk a bit more about how we think the EV, AV and other business revenue streams are accretive to our overall business. So, let\u2019s take a quick look at where our strength lies today.Our strength is in Middle America with trucks. That\u2019s where we sell our most vehicles, that\u2019s where we make most of our money. And if you look at the AV and EV opportunity that you heard about today, we expect that those businesses will first have a meaningful manifestation in areas where GM has an opportunity from a market share standpoint. So, we think it\u2019s very much complementary to our core business and particularly to our truck business.I talked about subscriptions previously, and I want to frame that up a little bit more in our core and our Cruise businesses, the automotive model today as you sell the vehicle and you see the customer x number of years from now. And, as we think about and we\u2019re working on future revenue opportunities, you heard Dan talk about the business model that Cruise is working towards and on the automotive side, whether it\u2019s licensing or subscriptions or customer inside coming from the data we have responsibly monetized, we think those are additional revenue streams, which we\u2019re currently not capitalizing on, which present a huge opportunity and they\u2019re complementary to our one-time transaction nature and they\u2019re high margins as well and highly cash generative.So in closing, I would like to leave you with this slide. Why are we uniquely positioned relative to our competition? We have valuable franchises that are cash generative, and we have accretive growth opportunities on AV, EV and other areas that we\u2019re laser focused on capitalizing on. And from a cyclical standpoint, we\u2019ve taken a number of proactive steps to strengthen the business and position us well for the cyclicality that typically comes with this business. And we believe that this positions us well with a very strong foundation to create shareholder value.With that, I thank you, all, and I bring Rocky up to start our Q&A. Rocky Gupta : Thank you. Dhivya. I\u2019m going to request all the speakers from today to come onto the stage for the Q&A. If you have a question, please raise your hand and we\u2019ll get a mic to you. Just wanted to remind everyone again that the Investor Relations team is available to address any additional questions you may have, especially any detailed questions on the numbers. And what I\u2019d suggest is that to use our time most efficiently today, we focus on some of the more strategic questions for the people on the stage today. And Matt will be joining us on phone also. So, we\u2019ll get him dialed in.Let\u2019s get started. First question, Rod. Rod Lache. Rod Lache : Thanks. Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Three questions. First, maybe just a quick housekeeping, Dhivya, if you can just clarify. In your guidance, how much working capital you\u2019ve anticipated in your free cash flow and the buybacks, whether those are incorporated into the guidance. Dhivya Suryadevara : From a working capital standpoint, while we would expect some rewind of sales allowances from a strike recovery perspective, we expect that will be offset, Rod, by other working capital items, including industry impact and timing. So, we\u2019ve had no tailwind assumed in our free cash flow guidance from that. And your second question was... Rod Lache : And the buybacks... Dhivya Suryadevara : Well, the buybacks is a use of the free cash flow. So, we expect that out of the $6 billion to $7.5 billion we generate. We would replenish our cash balance to the tune of $2 billion to $3 billion, and the remaining towards buyback and other uses. Rod Lache : So that\u2019s built into your EPS guidance. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. Rod Lache : Okay. And then just focusing on the international businesses. I was hoping that maybe you could be a little bit clearer on the GMI turnaround. How much of this you\u2019re going from about $1.3 billion loss to a profit is actually exiting products \u2013 or, exiting markets, how much of it is product, and then, if Matt is on the line, maybe talk a little bit about the China business and why we should believe that that business is kind of stabilizing and improving. It\u2019s been losing some market share. It\u2019s down to about $200 million a quarter of profitability, mapped, and the recorded remarks mentioned a number of headwinds and spending. Is it just underperformance related to powertrain that\u2019s been corrected? Or is there something else here that we can look at and say that now it should start to perform in line with the rest of the industry? Dhivya Suryadevara : Steve, do you want to take the GMI question? Steve Kiefer : Yes, sure. I would say that there is sort of a \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about $2 billion. There is about $0.5 billion in this improved product that we\u2019ve talked about that was in my slides, the new vehicles. And then I would say the remainder is a combination of cost cutting and restructuring that\u2019s been in the plan. Mary Barra : Matt, are you on the line? Matt Tsien : Yes, I am. So thanks, Rod, for your question. Can you hear me? Rocky Gupta : Yes. We can hear you, Matt. Matt Tsien : Great. Okay. Let me sort of start with 2019 and just sort of put it in context. So, in 2019, our performance was certainly impacted by industry factors in terms of the industry downturn and the China V to China VI transition, which put a lot of pricing pressure on the industry. But there were also a number of unique, I would say, company factors that you alluded to, Rod. I mean, at SGM, I would say the most significant company level factor is the challenges with customer acceptance on 3-cylinder engines with some of our customers. So the launches did not deliver the results we expected.And, as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re reacting quickly, and a number of the products will begin to have 4-cylinders as options as early as second quarter of this year. At SGMW, the key issue was the transition of the Baojun to a higher brand position. This is absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term. But as the plan pivots there are transition issues that impacted SGMW\u2019s performance.Looking into 2020, we expect that the industry downturn will continue. There will be increased fuel economy pressures and NEV pressures that will impact the industry as a whole and our performance as well. And then there is the additional fairly heavy investment cycle that we\u2019re into to deliver any of these for the future. So, we expect that our performance will continue to be challenged in 2020 and probably for the next couple of years. As we get through this investment cycle and with the industry recovery, we do expect that our equity income will pick up once again. Rod Lache : Thank you. Rocky Gupta : Great. Next, Joe Spak. I think you had a question? Joe Spak : Maybe, just to follow on quickly from Rod\u2019s question on South America or on GMI. The $2 billion improvement, $1 billion was from South America that other $1 billion, does that consider some of those additional restructuring actions you talked about from that use of cash? Or would that be \u2013 is that further restructuring or exits in GMI? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. It would be \u2013 to the extent, there\u2019s restructurings, it would be a use of cash, like we\u2019ve talked about previously. The $2 billion is \u2013 think about it as a run rate on how we would make 5% margin on that business on an ongoing basis as opposed to the $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion we\u2019ve lost in 2018. Joe Spak : Okay. And then Mark, on the BEV3 platform, I think versus that graphic that you showed prior, you\u2019ve added the pickup truck versus prior years \u2013 did something change there that allowed you to add to pickups to that platform versus your prior thinking that maybe, you need a stand-alone platform? And maybe, just at a very high level, you could tell us why you think you can sort of do this all more modular, because I think some of your competitors are building more specific platforms for different sizes and types of vehicles. Mark Reuss : Yes. We started a while ago, looking at the fundamental cell content pouch versus prismatic, versus the height of the floors of different models. So, what you saw in that animation indicated that we had everything from a low floor entry with different wheel bases to a mid-floor entry. I\u2019m talking about height-wise to a high-floor entry, which we would have for the BET.And so as we\u2019ve been architecting that, we\u2019ve been looking and trying to match the market desires to the architecture, and the cell \u2013 the basic cells are pretty much all the same. The only difference it will have is if you\u2019re in China, we would do one type of cell structure and we\u2019ll get into this on the EV day, but we do it in North America, it\u2019s a different type of cell structure. But the partners are all in place. The chemistries have been developed and vertically integrated, and that drives a different I think definition of what architecture was and what it is.And so our architecture is really around the cell and the orientation of the cell in the pack as you saw, the electric motors, we\u2019ve got at least three different electric motors that will be vertically integrated in the power structure for that. And then the power electronics and the global B part of it and the backbone will all be common. So, those are the big cost drivers and what is a new architecture for electric vehicles versus stampings, floor pans, rockers, chassis, pickup points, control arms. Those are all things that used to define an architecture, because they are the high-cost internal capital spends on a volume basis for a plant.And so it\u2019s very different. As we were architecting the first BEV, which looked like a crossover, we really started looking at what else can we do and how can we do it. And you\u2019ve only seen sort of the first models of BET architecture. There is another version of our BEV3 architecture that you\u2019ll see on EV Day, and I\u2019ll leave that as a surprise. So, if that helps frame it up a little bit. Very different. Rocky Gupta : Great. Next, move on Emmanuel Rosner. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. First question for Dan Ammann. Very refreshing to see you so bullish, optimistic about the opportunity. A lot of the other players that I have spoken recently were generally more cautious, maybe, the timeline getting pushed out and a lot of \u2013 the asset valuations coming down quite meaningfully. For us sitting on the outside, we don\u2019t have the benefit of being able to examine or test your technology. I guess what should we look for to know that this is real? What do you have that the others don\u2019t? And what kind of milestone can we track going forward? Dan Ammann : Well, I think the fundamental goal that most of our energy is behind now is this objective of reaching a superhuman level of safety performance, and that\u2019s as I went through in my talk, that\u2019s where most of the energy is and it\u2019s where we\u2019re making incredibly rapid progress. As I said, we\u2019re pretty far along in reaching that level of performance. We can see where we need to get to and we think we have the tools in place to close out that last step.As I mentioned, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly what the timeline is, because we\u2019re out on the very long tail of a sort of an exponential problem and we have incredibly powerful tools that we\u2019re bringing to those long tail issue. And so precise timing predictions are tricky. But we feel that that is something we can see from here. And again, that\u2019s just the starting point. What happens once you reach that point is where things get more and more interesting.In terms of what are we doing that\u2019s different from some others, I think one of the things that\u2019s really helped us all the way along is testing in a very complex operating domain. We also do some testing in a simpler environment and we know how much this helps us relative to this. So that\u2019s been really powerful.And then I\u2019d say secondly, this whole idea that the Company has been built around rate of improvement as a core product of what we do and building the infrastructure to allow us to move incredibly quickly and iterate more rapidly \u2013 and I showed you lots of examples of how we\u2019re doing that. And so I don\u2019t know exactly how others are thinking about that or doing it, but we have the core product of the technology stack we\u2019re building, and then we have another equally important product of building the infrastructure that allows us to get really rapidly. Emmanuel Rosner : And then just the housekeeping for Dhivya if I may. So, the earnings walks are extremely helpful. If I wanted to zoom in on GMNA specifically, so you\u2019re guiding for earnings up even versus ex-strike last year. So, call it more than $11.8 billion this year, very strong performance. Could you maybe, talk a little bit about the puts and takes? I mean, I assume the rebuild of inventory will not be part of that walk, because last year was \u2013 the starting point is ex-strike. So, what are the puts and takes and how should we think about that? Dhivya Suryadevara : So, the way to think about it, I\u2019d say, is what you saw in that slide on the GM specific factors, the puts and takes on that primarily impact North America. So, you can take those as North American specific items. Tailwinds, the new launches and full year of heavy duties and full year of light duties and cost saves, which predominantly impact North America positively. On the headwind side, full-size SUV downtime is what impacts North America the most. And I mentioned about 30,000 units roughly on a strike adjusted basis and depreciation \u2013 that\u2019s a non-cash item, but that\u2019s \u2013 put all that together, North America positive. Rocky Gupta : Great. Thanks, Dhivya. Itay? Joe, can you get the mic to Itay? Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Itay Michaeli from Citi. Two questions on Cruise for Dan. The first is in the slide referring to moving people, Dan, you mentioned possibly for tech partnerships. I was hoping you could elaborate on that. Would that potentially exclude some partnerships with rideshare companies? Or is that not in the plan? And then secondly, you mentioned that the competitive field is now thinning out. I was hoping you could talk about how many, without maybe naming names \u2013 or feel free to, how many competitors do you see that are viably competing with Cruise? Dan Ammann : So, on the first one, on the tech partnerships thing, I think that it\u2019s sort of \u2013 it\u2019s something we\u2019re just kind of reserving as we look at global markets and that have different existing market configurations. There could be places where partnership makes more sense than the sort of the core plan that we have of going vertically integrated.And then in terms of the field thinning out, I think this has happened over the last \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 18 months to 24 months, and I think as people have realized that this is not something you can do with 10 or 20 or 50 people and $10 million of venture capital, it\u2019s just a much bigger challenge than that and a much bigger scope of problem to work on. And so I think in California there were at one point more than 60 licenses that have been issued for self-driving testing, and I don\u2019t think when the dust settles here, there\u2019ll be 60 companies that have really delivered mission critical safety system and that drives with superhuman level of performance at a cost point that makes it work and an experience that makes it work from a customer point of view. Itay Michaeli : Just a follow-up, maybe housekeeping for Dhivya. Back to the large SUVs, if you can \u2013 the mention of the headwind this year and also the potential \u2013 and how you think about the opportunity in 2021, particularly some of the new trims like AT4 that Barry talked about in his presentation. Kind of how should we think about the variable profit opportunity on this platform after the launch? Dhivya Suryadevara : So your first question about 30,000 units on a strike adjusted basis. So, if we didn\u2019t have SUV down during because of the strike, the delta between what you\u2019re going to see in 2020 versus 2019 would be 30,000 down. So hopefully that helps. And, Itay, IHS has it roughly at the right level. So if that helps us another data point, that\u2019s another way to look at it. And in terms of profitable trims beyond 2020, AT4 and others, I\u2019d say better profits than average, and I will leave it at that. Rocky Gupta : Great. John Murphy, I think \u2013 yeah go ahead. John Murphy : Thanks very much. If we look back at 2019, I mean I appreciate the attempt to pro forma the numbers for your earnings. But the reality is what happened in 2019 happened, and if you look at the volume, it\u2019s probably more indicative of something that would have produced in a low 15 million unit environment. So you essentially just put up almost $5 in earnings in a low 15 million unit environment. You\u2019re talking about another $1 billion of cost saves in your $4 billion to $4.5 billion plan. Plus, you\u2019re talking about some potential improvement in GMI of $2 billion.So, just curious when you roll all that stuff together, it adds a lot of credence to the idea that you just talked about a breaking even at 10 million to 11 million units and actually maybe even then some. So I\u2019m just curious if you kind of update us where you sit on your thoughts on sort of break-even in \u2013 it seems like you are going to do couple of bucks, at least to the next downturn. I was trying to understand how you\u2019re thinking about that. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah, John, I think that\u2019s a really good way to think about it because if you look at the strike impacted results of $4.82 which we put up in 2019, that was after taking into account the impact of about 320,000 units down because of strike. When you market share adjust it, it translates to industry being down about 2 million units. And so the thinking about it as a curve from our earnings at 17 million units to our 25% downturn scenario, this matches quite nicely with what you would expect in an industry down. So to your point, it does validate the downturn thesis.With the actions we\u2019ve taken, we\u2019ve maintained the 10 million to 11 million breakeven point for North America. I would say we were probably hovering in the higher end of that range, and with the cost savings we\u2019ve come closer to the lower end of the range. And as we continue to strengthen the business and the rest of the operations around the globe, our downturn scenario looks better because you have fewer cash burning operations around the globe. So I\u2019d say, yes, it grants some credence to the downturn thesis and you will see us address some of the other problematic areas which should be better for downturn protection as well. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a second question around the subscriptions. I know it\u2019s sort of a TBD when Dan will deliver Cruise \u2013 we\u2019re waiting for that and we want it now, and that\u2019s a big part of \u2013 that\u2019s sort of an incremental subscription opportunity for you. But you have incremental opportunities that appears on some of the more near-term things like OnStar and OTA updates as you get to sort of this digital platform that, Mark, you were talking about.So, just curious if you can give us sort of where OnStar sits right now, where that could potentially go, and as you get this digital platform in place, could we see a lot more subscription opportunity sort of in the near term. And then Dan, what do you think the potential that you could bring to the table over time to the subscriptions? And is this recurring revenue outside of just the simple rideshare model from Cruise that you guys are kind of alluding to? Mark Reuss : Yes, let me take the OnStar question and the idea of paid on-hand, it\u2019s new opportunities, new businesses that may not exist today. We\u2019ve been really excited about our OnStar business and the growth that we\u2019ve seen there. Today, we\u2019ve got about 20 million vehicles that are on the road, and only about a quarter of those are connected and paying subscription. We also have a very limited portfolio of products that we sell. Essentially, there are three. And so \u2013 and even with all those constraints that I\u2019ve just described, this is a business that has been growing really nicely for us. And so, if we think about over the course of time, the vehicle part will continue to grow. The 25% subscription could be something significantly higher than that. And the portfolio can be quite a bit larger.And so, we\u2019re engaged right now with customers and with the product development organization and trying to figure out what are those products and services that are most interesting to the customers and how do you bundle those up and how do you put them onto the vehicle, how do you sell them, how do you go to market. And we see a very nice opportunity there with a fundamentally different margin profile than today\u2019s hardware business. And so, I think as we go forward over the course of time, it is an area that we do want to talk to you about. Dan Ammann : And on the Cruise side, I\u2019d say the \u2013 we\u2019ve all grown accustomed to the sort of pay-per-ride demand pricing environment around rideshare. I think that\u2019s one way to do this. I think there are lots of other interesting models in terms of how you engage customers now you have them sign up and pay. It\u2019s obviously very early days, but I think there is a \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty wide open field of opportunity there. John Murphy : And then just one quick one. I mean, on the luxury SUV market in China is gangbusters. And you said it\u2019s great. You have the best luxury SUV in the world in the Escalade. Are we ever going to see the Escalade in China? It seems like a huge incremental opportunity for you. I mean, obviously it\u2019s larger than most stuff that\u2019s over there, but the Mercedes S-Class sells at similar price points, which just seems like a natural chance to take and try and develop that business in China? Mary Barra : Does Matt want to take that or I can take it? Rocky Gupta : Yes. Matt, did you hear the question? It was about the potential for Escalade in China. Matt Tsien : Yes, I\u2019d be happy to address that. First of all, Cadillac has done extremely well over the last several years and we expect that to continue to perform very well. I think the other trend that\u2019s happening China is the movement toward larger SUVs. A couple of years ago, the largest SUVs in the market were probably what we would call C segment SUVs. And now C segment SUVs are gaining acceptance. So there is a movement toward larger vehicles. Certainly we\u2019ll not rule out the potential for something like Escalade. Rocky Gupta : Great. Thanks, Matt. Adam? Adam Jonas? Adam Jonas : Thank you. So, I have a question for Mark and I have a question for Mary, but first a comment. I noticed that you were videotaping today\u2019s Investor Day. It\u2019d be great if someone could send that tape to Ford in Dearborn. I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ll hand deliver it myself to them if you don\u2019t send it to them. Your team is really airtight. I think you should be very proud of this presentation you gave. It\u2019s a kick-ass management team up here in front of us. You are executing. You\u2019re clearly not getting the credit. I know you deserve it. And I think many investors in the room deserve. But over time you keep doing this and you execute on even two-thirds of what you\u2019re talking about and it\u2019s going to happen. So I just had to get that out there.Mark, first question for you. Can you confirm are EVs a tailwind? And specifically, I remember a year ago when you talked about getting out a hybrids and people thought you were crazy. Mark Reuss : You didn\u2019t. Adam Jonas : I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not looking so crazy. I mean, can you describe maybe in financial terms or just order of magnitude how much easier \u2013 how much better life is when you don\u2019t have to architecture those complications into the business? Mark Reuss : Yes, I think it\u2019s a great question. The hybrid piece of this \u2013 when we look at this \u2013 and we look at what it takes to bring a plug-in hybrid, a traditional hybrid, any of those to market where you\u2019re carrying an internal combustion engine and an electrification propulsion system and you have to make them work together and you have to certify \u2013 you still have to certify, you still have to crash, you still have to pay money to carry two propulsion systems on board, I just, from a physics and engineering standpoint, can\u2019t get my head around making money doing that in the long-haul even as a stop gap. Even as \u2013 I mean, I\u2019m bragging of Volt, okay. I can tell you I love the Volt. By the way, I was one of the early buyers of the Volt.So that was great too, and I get a lot of emails from Volt buyers and I get it. But at the end of the day, if we can get the battery chemistry vertically integrated correct and cost effective and our control systems have taken everything we\u2019ve learned from Volt and Bolt on how to use the battery to get more range and more cost-effective. At the end of the day, the customer is going to be much, much happier doing a pure EV than a stop gap that you still have to plug it in sometimes and then hard to understand. I mean, honestly they\u2019re hard to understand. And so we know that because we\u2019ve done it and we\u2019ve done it reasonably successfully over a pretty long period of time.So, all that customer data plus the cost basis plus the engineering basis \u2013 and I told you last year, if I had another dollar of R&D from our company, I would spend it on getting the anode and cathode and the chemistry of our batteries better. Mary Barra : I\u2019ll give you a dollar. Mark Reuss : Oh yes. No, Mary. Thank you. And then everybody, thank you very much. We have really done a great job. So, anyway, that is a very impassioned speech about a very long answer to your question, but that\u2019s the way I feel, the way I do. Adam Jonas : Okay. And my final question for our CEO and Chairman, Mary. At the beginning of this presentation, I was really struck by the comments about the opportunity that GM has \u2013 I stress opportunity \u2013 to really help decarbonize the fleet, decarbonize your operations and show a rate of change that is clearly resonating with everybody at the margin, investors, your customers, regulators, governments, everybody. Would you consider, given your role as Chairman, would you consider tying a portion of management compensation, if not a significant portion, to GM\u2019s ability to show that progress of CO2 reduction? Because I kind of have this sneaking suspicion that you can show a lot of progress quite within your wheelhouse and then it would be outstanding for your business. Mary Barra : So the way our compensation system is set up, in our short-term incentive plan, 25% of it is individual performance. And I can tell you that achieving the metrics we\u2019ve put for ourselves are incorporated not into just mine or the appropriate people who sit next to me but even deeper in the organization. So as we look at that that is definitely something we regularly report to the Board. And we\u2019re stepping back and we\u2019re looking and say, if you look at Scope 1 and Scope 2, very well under way. Dane Parker who runs our sustainable workplaces organization that just became our Chief Sustainability Officer, we\u2019ve been on this journey for a while. And so we sit in very good shape.But we have to look at Scope 3 because right now we build ICE vehicles and we\u2019ve looked at what are the different routes, and clearly the best fastest way to have the least impact on the environment is to EVs. And that\u2019s another reason in addition to the technical and the fact that customers don\u2019t understand and it\u2019s more costly, is getting to EVs and doing it in a way that customers want to buy them as opposed to being regulated to sell them and then find the buyer. That\u2019s our mission and that\u2019s what we\u2019re on. But I would tell you that it\u2019s already incorporated \u2013 along with several other goals, but it\u2019s already incorporated into the metrics the Board holds me accountable for and the organization. Rocky Gupta : Great. Let\u2019s move to Ryan, Ryan Brinkman. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Thanks for taking my question, and thank you for the disclosure that your trucks business generates roughly $65 billion of revenue at a mid to high teens adjusted EBIT margin. I think that helps to underscore for investors the attractiveness of your trucks business. And I\u2019m not sure if that math is so simple, but it also underscores the fact that you\u2019re generating something like $11.5 billion of EBIT there assuming 17.5% of margin which essentially approximates all of your profit in North America, a region which has another $40 billion of revenue.So, can you talk about your plans to increase the margins and returns for your non-trucks business? And do you think there may be scope for additional rationalization of the passenger car lineup beyond that which was communicated in the November 2018 restructuring announcement? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. So just to frame up the North American operations and the various different vehicle lines, I\u2019d say from a passenger car standpoint, Ryan, the step we took in November of 2018 takes us quite a bit far in terms of taking us away from the segments that we\u2019re not generating an appropriate level of return. If you look at passenger cars, with the exception of Cadillac, where we have a couple of vehicles, as well as Corvette which does make money \u2013 and a couple of those vehicles \u2013 it\u2019s basically that. There\u2019s no more passenger cars really in the lineup in North America. In its other markets, as Steve talked about, we\u2019re working on getting those to profitability.And within crossovers, it\u2019s multiple different stories, depending on which segment do you look at. Our mid crossovers earn a very healthy level of return. Compact and small crossovers are more challenged with the pricing pressures we\u2019ve seen. And what Mark talked about earlier from a complexity standpoint, if you think about the parts we\u2019ve eliminated, how we\u2019re getting it all into fewer architectures and how we\u2019re getting material costs down and some of the brand work that Barry is doing from a \u2013 getting the ATPs of Chevrolet and GMC and Cadillac up, I think those are on a path as well. We clearly have more work to do, but we will continue doing that work.And internationally, you\u2019ve seen all the other cash burning businesses which are also on a path to profitability. So it is our goal to diversify the profitability overall and get that to \u2013 not all of them will get to truck level margins, obviously, but they will get to their appropriate level of margin. Mark Reuss : I think it\u2019s important to note on that too, as Dhivya mentioned, in addition to what we talked about earlier is we\u2019re now entering into a second term of these architectures, where we already spent the money to get the mass out the first turn. And so everything that comes online here has a much higher reuse of the core architecture level on an ICE platform. And then we move \u2013 these are positioned for two plus, okay, on a turn basis here. So we will get as many turns out of those as we can. But we\u2019re not going to do new ones of that, if that makes sense, okay. So it\u2019s a good place to be. Rocky Gupta : Right. Brian? Brian Johnson? Brian Johnson : Brian Johnson, Barclays. I\u2019ve lots of questions for EV days, but I\u2019ll keep those. I guess the big question is, look, the stock price is, as you know, roughly kind of where the IPO was. It seems to many of us say you\u2019re doing everything right in terms of GMNA, the investment in Cruise. But I mean, how do you think about the stock price, a, and, b, to what extent are you open to strategic options? I\u2019ll throw three out that I\u2019ve heard around the room as well as talking to investors.One would be consolidation of some sort. Certainly that\u2019s going on in Europe as we speak and up the highway from you. Second, the idea \u2013 should you just become a pure play North American truck company and everything else go somewhere else? Or thirdly Cruise sort of the next-gen businesses, OnStar, arguably creating tracking vehicles for those. Mary Barra : So, we are always exploring opportunities that are going to create long-term shareholder value. We\u2019re not interested in doing something that\u2019s just a short-term path, but \u2013 and we consider all lines as, I mean, I think we are in an era right now, where a lot of people are talking to a lot of people. I think people don\u2019t understand how significant the work that we\u2019re doing with Honda is when you think about fuel cells, when you think about AV and when you think about the fact with EV cells.For those of you who had a chance to see or look online for the Cruise Origin, the three teams worked together rather seamlessly. And in order for groups to work together, there has got to be \u2013 it\u2019s got to be at the engineering level and we\u2019re demonstrating that and we have been. But again, we\u2019ll consider all those opportunities. I mean, I think to get to your core question; we do feel General Motors is a compelling investment opportunity. We feel across many of our strong franchises, you mentioned trucks, we\u2019ve talked about OnStar, we\u2019ve talked about mid-crossovers. We do believe China is going to be very important in the future. It\u2019s still is a market that has tremendous growth potential. The scale that we get allows us to compete in a way from an electrification perspective across a full range of products and across the full range of \u2013 from value brands to luxury brands.So, I will tell you there is nothing that\u2019s off the table that we don\u2019t think is going to create long-term value. And we\u2019re going to aggressively go at what we are working on of improving the business as we just talked about with some \u2013 especially the small and the compact crossover segments. The global family of vehicles has been very important around the globe for doing that. Steve referenced that a bit.So there is the work we\u2019re doing on the car we feel very good about, and we feel we\u2019re getting to the final chapters in that. But then also our conviction around EV, our conviction around AV. We think it sets up General Motors to be uniquely positioned to participate strongly in the future of mobility. Rocky Gupta : Great. Thanks. Dan Levy, go ahead. Dan Levy : Thank you. First, just a question for Dhivya or Matt on China. Fully recognizing that coronavirus presents a whole new set of risks here. Can you maybe help us provide some parameters on what \u2013 you\u2019ve said down earnings but what might be a floor? Why this might not be as bad, whether it\u2019s because you\u2019ve already had downtime factored in, this gives you an opportunity to destock? And also on China, if we look back historically, the $2 billion a year that you\u2019re generating in equity income, the 9% margins, given everything that\u2019s happened in cycle at this point, is that just not at all a relevant comp for considering the forward results in China? Dhivya Suryadevara : Does Matt want to take that? Rocky Gupta : Yes, Matt, do you want to start with that? Matt Tsien : Yes. Let me just start and then maybe Dhivya you can add to that. Obviously, the coronavirus situation right now is very concerning. It\u2019s a very fluid situation, with updates that we\u2019re getting on a daily basis. As Mary had said at the beginning, our focus, first and foremost, is on the health and safety of our employees, and we certainly are very concerned about the situation on an overall basis.In terms of the impact on sales, there will be I believe a near-term impact on the overall industry. Fundamentally, dealerships have been closed for the Lunar New Year. In some regions, they\u2019re slowly ramping back up. In many other regions, they still remain closed. So we expect that there will be an impact on volume in the near term. Generally speaking as the crisis passes there will be some pent-up demand. So there will be probably some bounce on the other side of it. But in terms of predicting what the overall impact of it would be to our equity income, I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to sort of make that call. We obviously do the very best we can to get our operations started up when they could be started up and to manage our costs and expenses, to maximize our outcome. Dhivya Suryadevara : I would just add that. What you\u2019re basically witnessing is a level of equity income is almost like a downturn scenario in China. And from a level of margin standpoint as we go forward, cycling through some of the specific issues that Matt has talked about, whether it\u2019s four cylinder engine complementing our three cylinder offering or EVs rolling out at a better margin level, that, Dan, is by what I would say catalysts for getting the equity income back to a more normalized level. But we anticipate that happening over a couple of years as opposed to a few quarters. Rocky Gupta : I think we\u2019ve got \u2013 sorry, Matt, go ahead. Were you saying something? I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question. John, go ahead. Did I interrupt you? Were you saying something? Cool. John Murphy : Thanks. When I think about the extremely high truck returns that you mentioned, I harken back to the beginning of the presentation and the Hummer truck. From a consumer perspective, you\u2019re going to be judged on and compared with Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, and that means certain requirements around battery size, powertrain efficiency \u2013 they\u2019re going to be difficult to compete with. And then internally you\u2019re competing with very high margin \u2013 the truck segment. So how do you balance those two? Do you have to sacrifice one for the other? Or do you think that you can have your cake and eat it too? Mary Barra : Well, first of all, I think we can have our cake and eat it too, because I think understanding the truck buyer and understanding those will be initially attracted to the GMC Hummer EV, and we think it\u2019s accretive to what Dhivya talked about and I\u2019ll let Mark talk about the proof points. Mark Reuss : I can\u2019t answer everything on how that truck \u2013 our competitions are going to actually come to market with that and when. So a little bit hard to tell from what \u2013 I read the same things you do, so I don\u2019t have any inside information on that. But what I do know is that what we\u2019re going to deliver hasn\u2019t been really shown in its entirety yet. And I think we\u2019re here to win. We\u2019re not here to compete. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything inside GM that\u2019s going to compete with that either. It sort of will be a very different application. Time is up, Rocky, I know. But I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think we are here to win. So that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say, and I feel really good about it and you haven\u2019t seen the interior, you haven\u2019t seen the exterior. I think on May 20, and you\u2019ll see that. Hopefully, you will feel as good as I feel. I think you will. Rocky Gupta : Great. Thanks. I\u2019d like to thank all the speakers on the stage. And Mary, would you like to wrap up with any words? Thanks, Matt. Mary Barra : Sure. If I could have you for just one second, if you give me one minute to close? Thank you, all. Sorry. So I do want to thank you all for being here today. I know we\u2019ve covered a lot and we have more to cover. I appreciate your questions. I know there is a bit more. We\u2019ll be able to answer those questions as we go forward.But today, our goal, as I said, when we started was to leave you with the confidence in our vision and the strategy that we\u2019re executing and that you believe that General Motors is well positioned to lead in the future of mobility and in the industry. We have strong franchises, as we\u2019ve talked about, with our trucks, with our full-size SUVs, with our mid-sized SUVs, and I believe we have the strongest product portfolio in our history.We also are investing and have business leadership positions in growth areas like EV and AV and we\u2019ll tell you a lot more about EV when we get to March 4th. Our strong underlying business performance is driven in part because of the difficult decisions we\u2019ve made over the last few years and our commitment that we are going to be disciplined with our capital and really work to make sure every dollar we invest is going to earn its appropriate rate of return for you, our investors, our owners.Also, we are working hard to make sure our employees understand. When you go through this much transition and this much transformation in a short period of time, you need to make sure your employees understand how they fit in so they\u2019re with you. We\u2019re spending a lot of time to make sure our employees are part of this mission, and I can tell you, as I said, they get excited when we talk to them.So just to close, I hope we see you all on March 4th, and we can hopefully continue to earn your confidence in the program that we\u2019re executing. We\u2019re moving fast, the world is moving fast and our competitors and moving fast, but we\u2019re going to continue to execute.So thank you, all, very much. Appreciate all your time today.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, May 6, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Dorothy. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM\u2019s financial results for the first quarter of 2020. A press release was issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. We\u2019re joining you from separate remote locations today. On the call this morning, I\u2019m joined by Mary Barra, GM\u2019s Chairman and CEO; Dhivya Suryadevara, GM\u2019s Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. As usual the content of the call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rocky, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining. This quarter we have a lot to cover. So, I want to begin by updating you on our plans to safely restart our operations. Then we will share the specifics of our COVID-19 activities, and our first quarter financial performance. Our work to resume production has been an ongoing process, and I am pleased to report that based on conversations and collaboration with unions and government officials, we are targeting to restart the majority of our manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Canada the week of May 18 under extensive safety measures. We made this decision with the safety of our employees as our top priority and I want to thank them for their patience and their commitment through this process. Ever since we suspended our operations in March, our teams have been collaborating internally and externally to understand and share the best practices to be able to return to the workplace. This includes the global safety standards we implemented when we reopened our facilities in China as well as Korea, which remained open during the COVID-19 outbreak there. I will go into additional details about the extensive return to the workplace safety protocols in a few minutes. As we prepare to go back, our thoughts continue to go out to everyone around the world who has been personally affected by COVID-19 and the wellbeing of our employees remains our top priority. Early in this crisis, we recognized that while our operations in North and South America were suspended we had the capability to quickly support production of crucial ventilators and personal protective equipment. On March 17, we were introduced to ventilator manufacturer Ventec. With tremendous collaboration that included UAW leadership and suppliers, we began shipping ventilators from our Kokomo, Indiana facility just one month later. We are fulfilling a government order for 30,000 ventilators to be completed by the end of August. In Brazil, we are leading a federal government task force to repair ventilators. In addition, we are making masks, face shields and gowns in several of our facilities for both health workers and for our employees. As of yesterday, we have donated one million masks to hospitals in the United States. We are proud of the employees who have volunteered to do this work following the footsteps of generations of automotive employees who had supported the greater good during times of crisis. Now, let\u2019s shift to the quarter. We entered this crisis better positioned financially because of the many business transformation actions we have taken over the past several years to improve our competitiveness. As we suspended operations, we also moved quickly to preserve our liquidity and protect the business. In March, we suspended guidance for the year and implemented significant austerity measures and drew down our revolving credit facilities. Last month we also suspended our quarterly dividend and share repurchases. So, let\u2019s take a look at the numbers. In the first quarter, we delivered net revenue of $32.7 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $1.2 billion, EBIT-adjusted margin of 3.8%, EPS diluted adjusted of $0.62, adjusted automotive free cash flow of negative $900 million, and a ROIC-adjusted of 13.2% on a trailing four-quarter basis. The outbreak significantly affected EBIT-adjusted in the quarter and we expect an even greater impact in Q2 because of the production stoppage, a phased restart and what we believe will be lower market demand. Importantly, our work on safety early in the quarter ensured we could deliver on our commitment to near-term launches like our full-size SUVs and getting parts to our dealers. In Arlington, we completed the build-out of the previous generation of full-size SUVs and the planned conversion for all new models. We will begin shipping the first units to dealers in early June. And our customer care and aftersale warehouses employees across the country have been supplying parts to dealers so they can take care of our customers and also keep their service businesses running. Our EV and AV work also continues uninterrupted even as many of our engineers work remotely. That means producing \u2013 the production timing of key entries like the GMC Hummer EV, the Cadillac Lyriq crossover EV and the Cruise Origin AV remained fully on track. While the world has changed dramatically under COVID, the importance of Cruise mission to transform transformation for the better is unchanged as is Cruise importance to our vision of a world with zero crashes, zero emission and zero congestion. Cruise continues to make very rapid progress toward its initial goal of superhuman driving performance. While on-road testing has been reduced under COVID, Cruise has remained \u2013 has maintained a presence on road in Phoenix, Arizona and in recent weeks has restarted driving in San Francisco in support of the community by autonomously delivering food and other essentials to those most in need. These activities combined with Cruise cutting edge simulation capabilities have enabled the team to continue to make rapid progress during this period. As you know Cruise is well capitalized and this is especially important and an advantage for us during these volatile times. We have and will continue to grow our team by recruiting and retaining the very best engineering and leadership talent. So let\u2019s shift to our dealers. We know many of them have been heavily impacted by the crisis and we are supporting them in a number of ways, including Shop-Click-Drive. This is a leading e-commerce tool that completes much of the vehicle purchase transaction online. When combined with dealers making contactless home deliveries, it\u2019s a powerful tool for our dealers and for our customers. An additional 750 dealers have enabled Shop-Click-Drive since the COVID outbreak. So now, 85% of the U.S. dealer network is participating in Shop-Click-Drive. Of these 90% offered touchless home delivery experience. In an industry that is down 40% Shop-Click-Drive interactions are up 41%, so visits are at an all-time high. And stay tuned for improvements to Shop-Click-Drive as we are working aggressively to add eight new features and capabilities in the coming weeks. And finally, putting people first also means taking care of our customers, many of whom have been financially affected by the pandemic. GM Financial is offering case-by-case solutions including late fee waivers and OnStar is offering its crisis assist services and free WiFi to keep customers connected to emergency resources and to loved ones. In short, we are positioned to manage through the near-term market dynamics because of swift actions that we took to preserve liquidity, our uninterrupted work on our EV and AV portfolio, our on-time launch strategies for our full-size SUVs, our continued ability to supply parts to dealers who need them and by leveraging e-commerce and contactless tools like Shop-Click-Drive. In the coming days, as we get closer to resuming our operations, we will share our complete return to work playbook first with our employees and then with other stakeholders. However, today I will briefly share a high-level review of the safety procedures we are putting in place. This applies to everyone entering our facilities. Our approach meets or exceeds CDC and World Health Organization guidelines, and as I mentioned earlier, is informed by the global standardized processes we developed for use in China and Korea, as well as input from our union leadership. We have already applied these protocols to Kokomo, Arlington, Warren and in our customer care and aftersale operations. Where our coronavirus safety protocols have been in place, we have not seen a confirmed case of community spread in our facilities. We have also shared our protocols with our suppliers as they return to work because our supply chain is key to our ability to resume production. When anyone enters a facility, they will do a self-assessment questionnaire and they will have their temperature screened. Our protocols also require frequent hand washing, additional cleaning of workstation and common areas, continued physical distancing, wearing a mask and in some cases wearing a mask and safety glasses. We will also increase time between shifts to further promote physical distancing as people enter and exit the worksites. Now, I\u2019d like to shift to our regional performance in Q1. In North America we were tracking toward a very solid quarter until we suspended our operations. Sales of full-size pickups outpaced the industry by double-digit percentages and drove year-over-year improvements in market share and financial results. As we begin to replenish the pipeline, trucks and full-size SUVs will remain a very high priority. Overall retail and fleet volumes were down in April, but we continue to see resilience in truck deliveries. In April GM\u2019s incentives for light-duty pickup trucks were below the segment average. As I said earlier, we remain 100% committed to the EV technology and products we showed in March as well as our agreement to jointly develop and manufacture two all new electric vehicles for Honda, based on our EV technology. Honda will also make our OnStar and driver assist technologies available in these vehicles. This collaboration builds on our existing partnership in EV, AV and the fuel cells space. It demonstrates our EV cost and technology leadership and will help us deliver a profitable EV business through increased scale and capacity utilization. Turning to our international operation. China was our first major market affected by COVID-19. It put downward pressure on an already weak industry and we experienced a significant year-over-year decrease in volumes and equity income. Production has resumed in China under strict safety protocols and dealers are beginning to report improved retail traffic. Following the strongest impact in February, the industry started to pick up in March and GM China sales posted gains in April year-over-year. We expect to see gradual recovery as a result of our strong mix of new products and the positive impact of government subsidies. However, the outbreak will still affect our overall 2020 results. Also in GM International we announced we will wind down vehicle sales and design and engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand and retire the Holden brand in 2021. We will instead focus on sales of GM specialty vehicles. In Thailand, we will sell our Rayong manufacturing facility and withdraw Chevrolet from the domestic market and end vehicle sales by the end of the year. These measures build on the comprehensive strategy we laid out in 2015 to take actions and markets that do not earn an adequate return on investment. In South America, we continue to work with our stakeholders to turn around the business and capitalize on our leading volume and market share in the region. We will continue to take decisive steps to further accelerate our actions to improve the business. We will streamline and integrate our product portfolio, implement additional austerity measures, take pricing actions and optimize our manufacturing footprint in terms of capacity utilization as well as work to increase localization efforts. Before I turn it to Dhivya, I want to assure you that our leadership team is acting on everything within our control to protect our employees and the business during these uncertain times. With the same result and discipline we have demonstrated for years, we will continue to focus on conserving cash and preserving our liquidity without sacrificing investments in key product programs and technology that will lead us into the future. In addition, we are actively working to accelerate our transformation and seize opportunities in this environment. With that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thanks, Mary, and good morning everybody. We\u2019re experiencing unprecedented times as a result of this pandemic and given this backdrop, we\u2019re providing increased transparency into our cost structure, balance sheet and key drivers of liquidity. As you all know, coming into this, we had already taken a number of actions over the past few years to strengthen the company, including addressing underperforming businesses across various international markets and maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet. Additionally, the transformation actions that we took in late 2018 and the recent focus on improving cash flow has put us in a much better position today as we face these challenging market conditions. Our liquidity continues to be very strong at $33.4 billion at the end of first quarter. Even in an extreme scenario with zero production, our current levels of liquidity will take us into Q4 of 2020. In addition, the capital markets continue to be open as a way to access additional layers of liquidity to take us beyond that timeframe. With that, let me give you an overview of the drivers of our cash flow. First, let me touch on revenue. While revenue from vehicle sales have been minimal over the past few weeks, our high margin after-sales and OnStar businesses continue to operate at a reduced rate. Looking at outflows, outflows are primarily comprised of three buckets; the ongoing cash cost [Technical Difficulty] and unwind of negative working capital. On the cost front, we have aggressively reduced our ongoing cost through significant austerity measures and used a zero-based budgeting approach. Some of the more notable cost actions include significant cuts to our advertising and other discretionary spends, compensation deferments and certain employee furloughs. And after these austerity measures, we expect our ongoing cash cost, including tax, interest and pension to be approximately $2 billion per month. These cost austerity measures will normalize as production and demand normalizes. Next let\u2019s move to CapEx. As you know, our expected spend for the year prior to the crisis was $7 billion. We\u2019ve deferred certain non-critical CapEx programs related to product refreshes and CapEx varies from quarter to quarter and it\u2019s expected to be $1.5 billion in Q2. This is a deferral of 25% of our planned CapEx for Q2, but it does not impact near-term programs like our full-size SUVs and strategic investments in EV and AV programs will continue as planned. Additionally, we are in a unique position as we have transitioned past the necessary investments in our full-size trucks, SUV and crossover franchises. Finally, let\u2019s look at the third bucket, which is the unwind of our negative working capital. At the end of March, our net AR/AP was $13 billion of which $10 billion flexes with production and typically unwinds in less than 60 days. Therefore, a bulk of these payments are behind us in April with some additional payments in May, after which it trails off. We also had finished goods inventory in transit of $2 billion, which we expect to liquidate during the same time period. In addition, we have sales allowances to the tune of $10 billion, which normally pay out over to four to five months, but this will flow with lower demand. Putting all these pieces together and acknowledging it\u2019s difficult to predict how the production will evolve, we still wanted to offer some helpful context on how to think about the second quarter in the absence of guidance. We are targeting a May 18 restart date for production in our North American plants. And as we follow our new safety protocols, production ramp will be gradual, starting with one shift for a period and increasing to two or three shifts as appropriate. So, if you look at a scenario, in which global production is down 60% to 70% year-over-year for Q2 with an $8 million to $10 million U.S. SAAR backdrop, we can expect a total cash flow outflow of $7 billion to $9 billion, including the cash cost and CapEx at the rates that I referenced above, a working capital unwind of $3 billion to $4 billion, a sales allowance unwind of $2 billion to $3 billion, mitigated by contribution from vehicle sales, aftersales and OnStar of $3 billion to 4 billion along with dividends from China and GM Financial, and other liquidity actions of $1 billion to $2 billion. In other words, three quarters of the net cash outflow in Q2 can be attributed to working capital and sales allowances, which demonstrates our ability to meaningfully reduce our cost during times of stress. Assuming the production normalizes further in Q3, we would expect working capital to rewind on a pro rata basis, all else equal with sales allowances dependent on production and demand. Let me reiterate that these factors are inherently difficult to predict given the volatility in demand and production timing and levels. [Technical Difficulty] comment on our breakeven point. as we have previously communicated, our expected North American EBIT breakeven of 10 million to 11 million units is still intact. From a free cash flow perspective, excluding managed working capital, we expect to generate cash in North America at demand levels only slightly higher than the EBIT breakeven primarily due to pension income and CapEx versus depreciation levels. On a global basis, we expect breakeven automotive free cash flow, excluding managed working capital, at 25% reduced demand from 2019 levels, which generally implies the U.S. industry sales of 13 million units. Couple of points on additional liquidity measures we\u2019ve taken recently. As you know, we drew on our $16 billion of revolving credit facility; we renewed our 364-day revolver and extended the majority of our three-year revolver by one year. We also suspended dividends and share repurchase program, and continue to look at other options to further shore up liquidity. Before I comment on the quarter, I do want to share some key metrics for the FinCo and how they are weathering the crisis. GM Financial was well capitalized going into this with strong underwriting standards and a history of managing successfully through downturns. Typically, GM Financial is inherently cash generative during the downturn as assets liquidate faster than debt, creating excess liquidity as the balance sheet strength in an environment, in which sales are lower. GM Financial leverage was 9.3 times as of March 31, below the 10 times managerial target as well as below the support agreement threshold of 11.5 times. GMF would be able to sustain losses of approximately $2 billion at its current balance sheet size before requiring any capital under the support agreement with GM. GMF earnings before tax will be lower this year as credit losses are expected to increase to 2% to 2.5% and residual values decline 7% to 10% in 2020 in line with industry expectations. We have stress tested GMF\u2019s balance sheet under draconian credit and residual value loss scenario, considerably more severe than what the industry experienced during the global financial crisis. Under a scenario of doubling both the credit loss expectations and the residual value decline in 2020, GM will still not be required to contribute capital. GM received $400 million dividend from GM Financial in Q1 and is expected to receive at least another $400 million this year. GM Financial liquidity is also robust at $23.9 billion at the end of Q1 supporting at least six months of cash needs without access to capital markets. During the current crisis, GMF\u2019s strong origination and customer support initiatives are partially mitigating the impact of a lower sales environment. Now, let me frame up the quarter\u2019s results for you, focusing on the underlying performance of the business. Q1 results of $0.62 in EPS-diluted adjusted includes a $0.28 loss from Lyft and PSA revaluations. Q1 EBIT-adjusted of $1.2 billion reflects an estimated $1.4 billion impact from the pandemic with GMNA accounting for about half of it; China, $300 million; GM Financial, $300 million; and GMI, $100 million. The adjusted automotive free cash flow in the quarter was a burn of $900 million, reflecting normal seasonality, partially offset by an increased dividend from GM Financial, lower CapEx and positive working capital timing. The free cash flow impact of the pandemic is expected to be an outflow of $600 million. Looking at North America, while our retail sales have clearly been impacted with Q1 down 10.5% and April down 35% year-over-year, full-size pick-up trucks have shown resiliency due to the strength of our new truck portfolio as well as the segment\u2019s trend in geographies that have so far been less impacted by the pandemic. Our inventory levels remain lean and well positioned as we came out of the strike. We ended April with 550,000 units of inventory. Let\u2019s move to GM International. China equity income loss in Q1 was less than $200 million despite a reduction of wholesales more than 60% year-over-year demonstrating the resilience of the China business during the downturn and the significant austerity actions that the team has taken to mitigate the impact. We are starting to see signs of recovery in China as production has completely restarted and dealer traffic across the industry has increased 70% of pre-COVID levels at the beginning of April. As the effect of the virus subsides, we expect to revert to a quarterly equity income run rate of $200 million. We continue to expect dividends to be paid from our China operations between Q2 to Q4 consistent with prior years. In South America, in addition to lower production, we\u2019re facing an ongoing FX rate headwind. We\u2019re focused on taking price, leveraging our global family of vehicles and driving additional cost actions to mitigate these challenges. A few comments on Cruise and our Corp segment. Cruise costs were $200 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations. Corp segment costs were $400 million negative, unfavorable $600 million year-over-year, primarily due to a net loss of $400 million from Lyft and PSA in the first quarter of this year, compared to a $400 million gain in our PSA and Lyft investments in the first quarter of last year. We\u2019ve made significant progress in our transformational cost savings initiatives of $3.6 billion achieved in 2018. We\u2019re on track to our target of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, achieving another $300 million in Q1. In summary, the Q1 results demonstrate that the company entered this crisis from a position of strength. The actions we\u2019re taking position us to come out of this downturn strong and allow us to capitalize on the recovery and future opportunities. The entire team is committed to executing our strategy, while continuing to have a laser focus on the cost structure, the balance sheet and improving cash flow. This concludes our opening comments and we\u2019ll move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all of those details. Just first on the housekeeping side, I just wanted to make sure, Dhivya, I heard you correctly, were you saying that the EBIT breakeven corresponds with 10 million to 11 million U.S. SAAR and the free cash flow breakeven corresponds with around the 13 million SAAR. Is that correct? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yeah, that\u2019s correct, Rod. EBIT breakeven for North America at 10 million to 11 million. And if you look at cash flow breakeven for North America would just be slightly higher than that. And when you factor in the negative, the cash burn that you have from International as well as the Corp segment, you would need more SAAR to cover that and that\u2019s how you get to 13 million unit. Rod Lache : Okay. But you were referencing North America. I presume you meant the equivalent of a U.S. SAAR for the North American business. Dhivya Suryadevara : That\u2019s correct. Rod Lache : Okay. Thanks for clarifying. Could you talk a little bit about now that you\u2019re kind of plotting this restart, what kind of trajectory are you expecting from here? Obviously, at one point, you were expecting to do something close to a 10% margin, but that\u2019s going to be affected by the level of production. And then secondly, pricing looks very good considering everything that we\u2019re seeing with respect to incentives and also the trajectory of used car prices. Is that something that you view as aberrational and what kind of used vehicle pricing environment have you assumed both for the auto business as well as GM Financial? Dhivya Suryadevara : Sure. So\u2026 Mary Barra : Hey. I\u2019ll answer... Go ahead, Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara : Go ahead, Mary. Mary Barra : I would say, and on the margin question, I think we\u2019re very focused on restarting. As I mentioned, we will start in a very cadence and thoughtful way of first shift and then growing to two or three shifts depending on the plant and the demand. I think it\u2019s too early to forecast margin predictions, but what I would say is we will continue to be laser like focused on our cost structure. I think through this process of going into a zero-base cost environment, we have found areas where we think we can be much more efficient as we move forward. So, we\u2019ll be looking to be very cash conscious as we go forward and seize the opportunity as we start building. And Dhivya, do you want to talk about the pricing? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. From a pricing perspective, things have remained strong, Rod, especially as it relates to the pickup market. A lot of the stats that I referenced, those \u2014 that segment is doing particularly well. Just to give you a data point there. As you know, the segment penetration of the overall industry was 13% to 14%. That\u2019s how it was running before this. And in March, you saw it go up to 18% and then in April to 21%. So, the segment\u2019s continuing very strong and with that the pricing remained strong as well. From a used vehicle perspective, we have assumed about a 7% to 10% decline in 2020 and obviously we\u2019re going to have to see what sticks later on. But Dan Berce is on the call and Dan, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that. Dan Berce : No, no. Dhivya, you\u2019re exactly right that our assumption for used car vehicle pricing is down 7% to 10%. That\u2019s really in line with industry estimates. And in terms of how that\u2019s going to affect retail, obviously, the trade-in value of the vehicle is going to be a little bit less. But as the FinCo we will take that into account in our underwriting and loan-to-value analysis. Rod Lache : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joe Spak : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. First question, I guess, Mary, I know you said you're not sacrificing investments in key initiatives, but you've also detailed some program delays. You mentioned some of the \u2013 CapEx down near-term. So, even though you're clearly pushing forward on some key programs, it does sound like some of these refreshes might be off the table. Is that really just a sort of short-term thing? Or given your sort of likely lower volume outlook over the next couple of years, we should think about those refreshes as sort of just not recurring, which might improve the cash flow and margins on those programs? Mary Barra : I would look at it. First of all, it would be \u2013 as we look at those refreshes, it would be a product-by-product or vehicle-by-vehicle decision. But most, I would say, is a delay or taking the time to be \u2013 look at what really is going to drive more customer value. So some are delayed, some we may re-scope a little bit more. But I do want to reiterate on our key programs, trucks, full-size SUVs, EVs, AVs, we are making no change. And the engineering team and design teams working on these are doing tremendous work. Joe Spak : Okay. Thanks. And then Dhivya, just maybe, just a comment on what sort of goalposts do you think you need to see to start to maybe repay some of the revolver? Is it just stability and more visibility into the outlook? And has this experience at all changed your longer-term views on either cash-on-hand or total liquidity thresholds? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I would say, as we \u2013 as production comes back online here in the next couple of weeks, that's when you would see, Joe, cash starting to come in, not just from contribution from the vehicle sales but also working capital rewind. So we're going to see that. And as we go forward, as things stabilize, we'll look to rebuild our cash balance as well as pay back the revolver. I would say that the long-term commitment to the strong investment-grade balance sheet and our cash and debt levels remains unchanged, and we will work our way back towards [changes] [ph] as the environment starts to stabilize here. Joe Spak : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dhivya Suryadevara : Good morning. Itay Michaeli : So, it sounds like you're finding some incremental efficiencies through the recent process. I was curious if that also might apply to CapEx going forward. I know you talked about some of the product refreshes, but could we see maybe the $6 billion rate, it sounds like you're running in Q2, become the new normal or is that premature to think in that way? Mary Barra : I wouldn\u2019t necessarily multiply Q2 by four to get the overall level because our capital is \u2013 kind of varies by quarter. But we'll continue to look for everything as we reevaluate and understand what the customer really wants, and it's going to create value for ways to not only conserve operating cost, engineering cost but capital as well. Itay Michaeli : Great. And just secondly, just curious how you're thinking about broadly the GMI turnaround that we spoke about back in February. Could we see a need for additional restructuring? And kind of how do you generally view that trajectory over the next couple of years? Mary Barra : So, I think the steps that we took in Thailand and Australia were very important. We see \u2013 there's good work going on in the restructuring we did, and Korea continues to be on track. Looking for recovery in the Middle East as we move forward. I think the real area of focus is South America, and we have taken significant steps over the last few years to turn around that business, taking the breakeven down by 40% and continue to see the impact of the foreign exchange. We have been actively working on what we can do from a South America perspective, specifically focusing in Brazil, and you'll see us take even additional actions there because it's just not acceptable, the performance that we have right now. So it's an area of key focus. Itay Michaeli : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : All right. Good morning. It\u2019s great to hear from all of you. Just a first question I mean, you\u2019re going through this zero cost base analysis because you have the opportunity given sort of the crisis. But I'm just curious, as you also think about sort of the restart of production, if you think about things the same way. And if there may be just a greater focus on restarting and pushing your pickup and SUV volume and maybe letting some other stuff lag. I mean, sort of in the near term, you might have this experiment that you might have much stronger mix that might stick going forward. I'm just curious on sort of the mix in the near term and how you might think about that long-term as you go through the restart process. Mary Barra : Clearly, we\u2019re pleased with the strength of the full-size trucks, and we expect as we roll out the full-sized SUVS, the product \u2013 the media reviews of the product are quite strong so we think it's going to be very well received in the marketplace. That is a franchise for us, and we plan on protecting it and growing it. So as we see opportunity, we're definitely going to seize it. And I would say, as you mentioned, we have found areas of savings that as you go through a situation like this, things that as you go to a situation like this, things that seem to be incredibly important when you really challenge them, you find opportunities to save. So we will do that, and we'll be focusing on our key product franchises. I don't know, Dhivya, if you would like to add anything. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I would definitely echo that. And John, as we think about coming back online here, we obviously have a close eye on dealer inventory by vehicle line and all the geographies as well as not all of them are created equal and we have different levels of inventory in different regions. So as we come back online, we will prioritize, to Mary's point, trucks as well as the specific terms and the mixes of the most profitable vehicles as well as geographies that are running right from an inventory standpoint. And we have the visibility into that, and that's how we're going to flex it as we ramp up here. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a second question. I mean the commitment to Cruise seems like it's unwavering, but there's about $1 billion a year going out the door without any revenue. I'm just curious if you're rethinking that dollar commitment on an annual basis, the potential business and monetization of it. And one phrase that I think you mentioned, superhuman driving experience sounds really appealing to me. Is there the potential that you could bleed some of those technology into your existing product portfolio over the next few years if you don\u2019t see the monetization of an AMoD fleet anytime in the near future? Mary Barra : Well, first, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress that they're making from a technology perspective at Cruise. Just reviewed that earlier this week. So I think that we are continuing to hit milestone after milestone there. So I'm very positive about what's happening at Cruise from that perspective. So, I see huge opportunity and so our commitment as you said, is unwavering. As it relates to bringing the technology into the \u2013 our fleet of vehicles on the road today, that's really occurring through Super Cruise, and we continue to add miles, add roads and add features. And you'll see us \u2013 as well as spread it across the portfolio, starting with Cadillac and then moving to others. So, definitely have an aggressive plan to further roll out and improve the capability of Super Cruise. John Murphy : One just last one, real quick, on the supply base, just curious how you're monitoring that. If you're seeing any stress in the supply base and if you see this as maybe an opportunity to try to incentivize or push consolidation into maybe, fewer stronger supplier partners that can support you in tough times. Mary Barra : We have been actively working with the entire supply chain. We have \u2013 as a regular part of our process, we have a very robust supplier financial risk management process. Obviously, we put that into overdrive as we go through this period. We've been maintaining regular communications with the suppliers and their financial health as well as all the work they're doing for us related to future programs, scheduling, et cetera. We're also studying the CARES Act and presenting key provisions to supply base to drive their participation. And then we are \u2013 have identified the high risk areas and are already working on mitigation efforts. So we are very pleased with the partnership that we have with the supply base overall. We'll continue to work with them and make sure we have a strong supply base as we move forward to start and then to continue to grow. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. And Dhivya, that was an absolutely \u2013 I mean, you're knocking the cover off the ball on transparency, which is especially appreciated during times like this. I just had to acknowledge that. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thank you, Adam. Adam Jonas : I\u2019m sure everybody on this have already had feedback on that. This is outstanding. So a question for Mary on working with lawmakers and governments kind of managing the recovery, looking beyond this. There's been an increasing kind of percolation around the potential of things, not limited to Cash for Clunkers but things of that nature in the media. I was wondering if you could share thoughts on where you \u2013 where GM stands on that. And maybe more importantly, beyond, what opportunities can GM and your auto brother and sisters make \u2013 work with governments to kind of take an industry that maybe didn't have enough of a national policy and could really make the most out of the crisis to push forward things like electrification and EV infrastructure. Thanks. Mary Barra : So, Adam, I think it\u2019s a great question and there\u2019s really three elements if I look at it; one, as we start producing vehicles, again, we are watching demand. And I think anything that stimulates demand in these early days that's simple and goes directly to the customer that was purchasing the vehicles, I think that's going to be helpful to get people back into the market because we look a little more broadly, and this is something we've said all along. Programs kind of a Cash for Clunkers, but for older vehicles, we know that every new model year, there's improvements made from a fuel economy and emissions perspective. So getting some of the oldest vehicles off the road would definitely help from an environmental perspective. And then we do think in the few years out, continuing to stimulate EV demand \u2013 not permanently because we are on a path to profitability. But getting people into EV, so they understand the benefits of EVs, as we work to have a full portfolio as well as have a robust charging infrastructure, I think that\u2019s going to be important as well. And we continue to have that dialogue with many members of government. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. And just a follow-up on capital allocation. Now since 2012 GM has repurchased, I think, well over $12 billion worth of stock I think at an average price of over $35 thereabout. Now I\u2019m not trying to put you on the spot here because your investors, for the most part, were really supporting those kinds of moves. But from today\u2019s perspective and kind of as you assess the importance of liquidity and investing in areas where you have advantage and getting back to that, what you call, a very strong investment grade, any comments on whether that \u2013 the world has changed? And whether you would expect that perhaps that the drumbeat of, \"Give us all your excess cash, please. Let\u2019s get back on the buyback course when things settle,\" that maybe it\u2019s different going forward? Mary Barra : Well, I think we remain committed to our capital allocation framework. And so when you first look at \u2013 the first pillar is to reinvest in the business to generate an appropriate return, greater 20% return on invested capital. We\u2019re going to continue to look for those opportunities, and I\u2019m quite excited about the opportunities we have in front of us from an EV and from an AV perspective. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. Clearly \u2013 and this demonstrates that it\u2019s vitally important to have that investment-grade balance sheet. And then we\u2019ll look to do what\u2019s right as it relates to our shareholders. Clearly, we need to make sure, though, I think that we stick to that first pillar and what we invest in is going to generate an appropriate return. So that\u2019s our thought, and we remain committed to the allocation process we outlined. Adam Jonas : Appreciated. Mary Barra : Thanks, Adam. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. Thank you. I just want to follow-up on a bit of the regional variation because, of course, we\u2019re not a monolithic country or a NAFTA area. So first, on the demand side, can you give us a couple of things? One, a little bit of color, since we\u2019re not doing monthly sales calls, on the very strong market share, 39% of our pickup trucks, which by my analysis, leaves dealers at the low end of inventory; b, how that varied just overall demand in April across geographies. And is the Sun Belt in Texas and Florida performing better? And then I\u2019ve got one question on the production side. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. From a dealer inventory and sales perspective, I would say that you cannot paint the entire country with the same brush. In the geographies that are not the coasts, Brian, we\u2019re continuing to see strength in trucks and therefore, lower levels of inventory. So as we start back up here on May 18, our priority will be those regions and those geographies that have performed really well. And just from a regional standpoint as well, I would say, across the country, we\u2019re seeing a commonality as it relates to people buying things online, and I\u2019ll give you a data point an industry that was down about 40%, Shop-Click-Drive was actually up 40%. So that\u2019s something that you\u2019re seeing across the board. So inventories, we are watching. Trucks, we\u2019re watching. And certain geographies, we\u2019re watching, and that\u2019s going to be a focus as we ramp back up here. Brian Johnson : And in terms of the drivers of that 39% pickup truck share, there\u2019s a perception that there [indiscernible] incentives but\u2026 Dhivya Suryadevara : Well, I would say you should look at ATP. GMC Sierra had record high ATPs at the levels of incentives that we had. And Brian, you\u2019ve seen that our incentives ebb and flow based on what market tactics our competitors have as well. And just in April alone, which was just last month, our incentives were lower than that of competition. So ATP is higher, discipline continues and the April incentives are another proof point that this is something that you\u2019ll see up and down, but we\u2019re committed to being disciplined. Brian Johnson : And on the production side, to give NAFTA, we\u2019re focused a lot on the Governor in Michigan and the Midwestern states. But can you talk a little bit more about the pace of ramping up, both your plan in Salao as well as the Mexican supply base, which, of course, feeds Arlington and further north? Mary Barra : So we\u2019ve been having regular dialogue with \u2013 from country \u2013 at the country level as well \u2013 of both Mexico and the United States as well as working with Governors in key states. And so that gives \u2013 we think those have been very constructive. I would also say we\u2019re able to talk about our safety protocol that has been \u2013 is very well thought through. It\u2019s three primary focuses of keeping people who are sick or potentially sick out of the plant; maintaining an environment; and then if someone is asymptomatic and is in the plant, a very targeted way to clean and do contact tracing to limit the exposure. And over the last several weeks, we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that\u2019s been quite successful. And so we think with those protocols and communicating and sharing our plans, we\u2019re in a good position as we talk to country leaders and state leaders. So the conversation has been constructive, and that\u2019s what informs our current plan on 5/18. Obviously, we\u2019ll continue to have dialogue with our unions as well as with the government leaders to do the right thing. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my questions, which is about your inventory level in the U.S. I think when the nonessential business restrictions began, your lean inventory, as a result of last year\u2019s UAW strike, it put you in a strong relative position as it implies less needed reduction in 2020 of wholesales relative to retail sales. Just curious, though, as the production shutdowns have lasted longer and retail sales have continued, albeit at a lesser rate, but with pickups leading the way, I know the days-on-hand calculation has increased given the abnormally low daily selling rate. But as you look ahead to when the restrictions are lifted and selling rates partly normalize, how are you feeling about your inventory level at that point, including maybe for some of the recently better selling models, such as full-size trucks? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I would, Ryan, in addition to what I already said, the other data point I would give you is just coming out of the strike, as you pointed out, the dealers have done an exceptionally good job of selling from a low inventory base. They\u2019re selling pretty deep, and they learned to \u2013 learned how to operate at a low inventory level. But I would say that as we open back up here, prioritizing trucks and getting them out remains our priority among other vehicle lines. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to prioritize. And from a days supply perspective, yes, high. But from an absolute perspective, we have seen LD especially start to come down. So we will certainly be looking to replenish that and continue to encourage our dealers to sell deep. Ryan Brinkman : All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi, thank you. Can you just provide us with some color on the $600 million cost tailwind in GM North America in the first quarter? I apologize if I missed it. But the $500 million in performance/other, how much of that reflected the transformation cost saves? And what types of inefficiencies were associated with the downturn? Are there any other sort of onetime benefits that we shouldn\u2019t expect to recur next year? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, I would say, Dan, that the transformation-related savings within that number was about $200 million year-over-year. So that\u2019s the goal that we laid out for ourselves, $4 billion to $4.5 billion. $300 million additional were saved in Q1. The rest of the numbers you\u2019ve cited, I would say, is timing, and I would not extrapolate that into the other quarters. Dan Levy : Okay. And no onetime benefits from cost actions that you took that would reverse next year, so to speak? Dhivya Suryadevara : No. I wouldn\u2019t say there was anything onetime in Q1. As you \u2013 as I said about the austerity measures that we\u2019re taking now, you got to be careful extrapolating that because as the production level normalizes and demand normalizes, you would see some normalizing in the austerity aspect of it, but the transformation will remain on track. Dan Levy : Thanks. Then a question on EV and the investment. We\u2019re obviously in an environment with fairly cheap gas and regulations in the U.S. adjusting to use. And you are obviously primarily exposed to the U.S. So you could make the case that it just lengthens the timeline of EV uptake in the U.S. and actually give you room to take the brakes off EV investment temporarily. So is the rationale for maintaining EV investment right now simply this is your future and there\u2019s just no compromise on that vision even amidst these unprecedented circumstances? Mary Barra : Dan, I think you said it well. Our commitment is unwavering. We think it\u2019s the right path forward. And we think with the Ultium battery platform that we have, the partnership we have with Honda, the strength that we have from China where EVs or new energy vehicles are a key part of being successful in that market positions us extremely well to have a leadership position in EVs with a full range of EV vehicles. So we are looking at every possible angle to continue to accelerate our EVs and our all-EV future. Dan Levy : And cheap gas and change regulations don\u2019t change that, correct? Mary Barra : Well, again, we believe this transformation will happen over a period of time. We\u2019re going to continue also, while we focus on EVs, also focus on our full-size SUVs and full-size pickup franchise that we have. And we continue to make all those products more fuel-efficient and emissions-efficient as well. So I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I think it helps with supporting our franchises when you have a low gas price. From a regulatory perspective, that \u2013 we\u2019re being driven by what we think is the right thing for the future and where the opportunity will be and to get there and be among the leaders. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Retail sales in China are recovering nicely in April, and I think GM said its sales were up year-over-year in China last month. Do you think the pickup in sales in China is a potential illustration of what sales could do in other countries after travel restrictions are lifted? Or do you think there\u2019s something unique to the China market that\u2019s leading to the strength in sales in that country in particular? Mary Barra : Mark, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s too soon to call. We\u2019re \u2013 we think it\u2019s very good that we\u2019re seeing the recovery in China that is more like a V recovery, but we\u2019re not counting on that. I think there are some factors, though. As you look at people\u2019s desire to have their own vehicle for transportation, that certainly could play into it across the globe as an opportunity. So I think it\u2019s too soon to tell, but we\u2019re very positive about what we see happening in China. And we\u2019re even seeing some uptick after the low in North America, specifically the United States, that didn\u2019t get as low as it did in China. Mark Delaney : I have just one \u2013 just a follow-up on the China market in particular. Can you just elaborate on what GM has seen in terms of its market share and how you\u2019re thinking about positioning the brand of your franchise there? Thank you. Mary Barra : Well, we continue to see strength with the luxury brand Cadillac. It continues to grow, and we\u2019re at a great point with Cadillac. Now that we have a full portfolio range, that we expect to see continued growth there. Clearly, Buick and Chevrolet are both opportunities for us. And we \u2013 with the strong product portfolio that we have with launches that we\u2019ve made and will make through this year, we expect to see strength there. And then also with our SGMW partners with the Baojun and the Wuling brand. So when you look at it across the board, we think we\u2019re well positioned across China with the right programs, and we\u2019re looking to grow share in China this year and then move as we move forward. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of John Saager with Evercore ISI. John Saager : Thanks. It\u2019s John Saager on for Chris McNally. On the FinCo, we saw the $100 million of charge-off or expected credit losses, which is quite a bit lower than the charge that Ford took last week. Can you walk us through some of your assumptions that went into that? And then just clarify if you can \u2013 we can expect a similar hit every quarter. Or is this just for Q1? Dan Berce : Yes. This is Dan. The charge in the quarter was actually closer to $250 million, not the $100 million. Our reserve that we took with the CECL adjustment at the beginning of the year plus the addition puts our retail reserve at about 4.4% of our retail portfolio, which is, I think, indicative of the expectation we have for where losses are going to go over the life of the loans. As Dhivya said in her remarks, we\u2019re expecting annualized losses for 2020 to be in the range of 2% to 2.5%. That\u2019s what we\u2019re reserved for, and we\u2019re certainly watching our credit metrics going forward to see if that estimate is going to hold true or not. John Saager : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Barra : Thank you, operator, and thanks everybody again for joining. We understand the seriousness of the multiple business actions that we have taken, but we believe they are necessary to preserve our liquidity and a very uncertain environment. I want to assure you that the entire management team is working to protect the business so that the restart and recovery began. We will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on new opportunities. We have a track record of making swift, strategic and tough decisions to ensure our long-term viability and we will continue to do so. And I just have to end on saying the strength of this company has always been its people and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of what everyone has done across the globe to not only support the business and do extraordinary things, but also to support their local communities. I think it just speaks to the character of the GM team. So, rest assured that we will stay focused, and we will do everything we can and everything we\u2019ve learned to emerge as a stronger and better General Motors position to create shareholder value. Thank you very much everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 29, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Tabitha. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined here today at the GM headquarters by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; and Dhivya Suryadevara, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary. Mary? Mary Barra : Rocky, thanks so much, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I'll begin with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has made this quarter one of the most challenging in our history. COVID-19 has impacted us everywhere we do business. It has changed the way we work, how we sell our products, how we support our customers and how we care for each other. Many of these changes will influence how we allocate future spending as we move forward. While our years of business transformation actions made the company more resilient, we also took additional proactive steps to help offset these challenges. Dealers stayed connected with customers with our online and contactless Shop-Click-Drive tool that we enhanced. Our customer care and after-sale operations remained open to keep our dealers and our customers supplied with the maintenance and repair parts needed. And our employees proudly rallied to build ventilators and personal protective equipment for first responders. We used our early learnings in China and Korea to safely begin restarting our operations in North America and South America with significant support from our supply chain unions and governments. We continue to collaborate with these stakeholders to ensure the highest levels of confidence in and execution of our extensive safety measures. While we can't predict the trajectory of the virus and its ultimate impact on public health and the economy, we have put all appropriate measures in place to position the company for continued recovery in the third and fourth quarters and beyond. Before I talk about our overall performance, I want to acknowledge another issue, the increasing responsibility of companies like General Motors to take a stand against racial injustice in the U.S. while remaining focused on driving business results. General Motors has a strong track record of diversity by many objective standards, but it's clear we must do more, and we will. During the quarter, we outlined several significant steps we plan to take. These, along with all of our progress across ESG, are detailed in our new sustainability report, which is available on gm.com. Now let's look at the numbers. Net revenue was $16.8 billion. We had an EBIT-adjusted loss of $536 million, EBIT-adjusted margins of negative 3.2%, EPS-diluted adjusted loss of $0.50, adjusted automotive cash flow of $9 billion negative and ROIC adjusted of 6.4% on a trailing 4-quarter basis. In North America, as part of our ongoing transformation, Steve Carlisle was named President of GM North America. Steve demonstrated track record and particular experience of strengthening the Cadillac brand and will accelerate our progress in our very important North America market. We also created an innovation and growth organization that will be led by Alan Wexler, our newly hired Senior Vice President who will report directly to me. Alan is the former Chairman and CEO of Publicis Sapient, a digital business transformation firm, and brings decades of experience, leading innovation and customer-driven technology solutions. Another positive development, the U.S. full-size truck and full-size SUV plants are currently operating at 3 shifts. To meet demand, we will add 200 employees in Fort Wayne effective September 1, which will increase our output by 1,000 units per month. We continue to offer customers a choice on how they want to do business with us. This includes using the Shop-Click-Drive tool where visits are up 50% this year, as well as our CLEAN program for those who prefer to physically visit our dealerships. Customers are now taking delivery of the first of our all-new full-size SUVs. Our Chevrolet and GMC dealers are selling every new Tahoe and Yukon they can get, and buyers are praising the new design and outstanding ride quality. The vast majority of initial Yukon sales are the highly profitable Denali. We continue launching new models through the summer, including the Chevrolet Suburban and the GMC Yukon XL. We've also begun building the highly anticipated 2021 Escalade. It's going well, and we anticipate starting regular production early. Among its industry exclusive technologies, Escalade's available Super Cruise offers new enhancements, including lane change on-demand functionality. Cadillac has generated the most consumer interest ever for the new Escalade with 600-plus orders already on the books. In addition, the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer and Buick Encore GX small SUVs are new market opportunities for both brands. Both are gaining share every month, turning fast at dealers and attracting new and younger buyers. Nearly 1/3 of Trailblazer's buyers are 35 or younger, and Encore GX has quickly become the brand's highest-volume Buick, surpassing the Encore. In other North America highlights, GM was highest -- was the highest ranked auto maker in the J.D. Power 2020 Initial Quality Study. Our brands led in 6 segments and 8 other models placed within the top 3. In addition, GM rose 3 spots in the J.D. Power U.S. Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout study or commonly referred to as APEAL. Our brands lead in 3 segments and 9 other models placed in the top 3. GM Defense won a $214 million production contract to build, field and sustain the Army's new inventory squad vehicle. It is based off of the 2020 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize truck architecture and leverages mostly commercial off-the-shelf parts. GM Financial, which performed well in the quarter, achieved 53% share of GM's retail business in the U.S. and has $24 billion in liquidity at quarter end. In June, we released our new OnStar Guardian app to select owners of GM vehicles. This allows them to bring the safety of OnStar outside the vehicle for the first time in its 24-year history and share access to the app with loved ones. So far, we've onboarded more than 7,000 customers and will soon roll it out to our entire GM owner population. Turning to our international operations. The business environment in China is improving. Following the deepest impact of COVID-19 in February, sales have been recovering month-over-month. Luxury, SUV and MPV segments, we are well positioned, are showing the greatest recovery. In the recent J.D. Power Initial Quality Study, GM's Yantai, Dong Yue North plant in China, which builds the Buick Envision, was ranked the highest automotive manufacturing facility in the world. Buick deliveries increased nearly 8% year-over-year, strengthening its leadership in the MPV segment with the all-new GL8 Avenir family. Its SUV portfolio will grow with the all-new Envision. Wuling sales grew nearly 10%, sustaining its leading position in commercial vehicles while strengthening its foothold in passenger entry. In South America, all manufacturing sites are operating in line with market demand, which remains below pre-COVID levels. We anticipate gradual recovery over time. To counter the impacts of the pandemic and macroeconomic conditions on our business, including FX, we continue to seek efficiencies, reduce costs and capitalize on the market success of the new Chevrolet Onix and Tracker. Elsewhere in international operations, restructuring efforts continue. The Korea transformation is progressing to plan with the recent launch of the Trailblazer for export and domestic markets. Domestic sales were up more than 16% in the quarter. All of our Thai dealers have accepted the transition package, and we have reached agreement with over 90% of our dealers in Australia and New Zealand. Now I'd like to shift and talk about our EV progress. Following our EV Day in the U.S. in March, the team continues to share our EV strategy with media and stakeholders in our global markets about our next-gen platform, Ultium battery technology and EV portfolio. The positive coverage is encouraging, and we will host a Tech Day next month in China to demonstrate our progress in this important market. The team also showcased our EV technology and design this month during a visit by the U.S. Secretary of Energy. We were pleased to accept a Department of Energy award that will help us develop lighter, stronger and less expensive battery enclosures. We are also making significant progress on our Ultium sales facility in Lordstown, Ohio with our joint venture partner, LG Chem. Site ground prep began in April, building foundation work started July 1 and crews will begin erecting building steel today. Also on track are the first of our upcoming EVs in North America based on our next-gen EV platform and Ultium battery system. The Cadillac Lyriq luxury electric SUV will be revealed next week; the GMC HUMMER EV, which we'll reveal in Q4; and the Cruise Origin AV that we've already shared. Lyriq scored the highest of any vehicle tested in our vehicle confirmation clinics. It was also the highest-rated in terms of exterior and interior appeal among vehicles, luxury and non-luxury, in the clinic data set. Our EV sales and portfolio are growing in China with overall year-over-year deliveries in the first half -- up for the first half of the year by more than 25%. New entries with our JV partner include the Chevrolet Menlo, which is in early phases of launch, the all-new Baojun E300 and E300 Plus, which support DC fast charging and charge in an hour, and Wuling's first all-electric models, the Hong Guang electric minivan and the Hong Guang Mini EV. And last week, we launched the Buick Velite 7, Buick's first all-electric SUV. Turning to AVs. Cruise continues to put its test fleet to work, autonomously delivering more than 50,000 meals to people in need in San Francisco as part of the COVID-19 relief efforts. Cruise is making strong technical progress, and we're expecting some exciting updates in the second half of this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dhivya. Dhivya Suryadevara : Thanks, Mary, and good morning, everybody. The second quarter was clearly one of the most challenging quarters in recent times with production in North America down 8 out of 13 weeks due to COVID-19. Wholesale is down 62%. However, even under these conditions, we were near breakeven EBIT in North America, demonstrating the resilience and flexibility that we've built into the business over the past few years. We view these results as proof points of the strength of the business, specifically North American breakeven levels of 10 million to 11 million of U.S. SAAR, global free cash flow breakeven levels, excluding managed working capital, of 13 million U.S. SAAR. This quarter's performance also highlights our ability to move quickly to preserve liquidity and the importance of having a strong investment-grade balance sheet. Automotive liquidity continues to be very strong at $30.6 billion at the end of second quarter. Retail sales have recovered from April lows to around 20% below 2019 levels at the end of the second quarter and trending better in July, even amidst a backdrop of limited inventories. We expect inventory levels to steadily recover from current levels, and we remain cautiously optimistic about the continued recovery in U.S. SAAR. Clearly, as you know, it's a fluid situation, and we're watching the infection rates across the country and its impact on auto demand very closely. Let me frame out the quarter's results for you. Q2 results of negative $0.50 in EPS-diluted adjusted includes an $0.08 gain from the PSA revaluation. Adjusted automotive free cash flow in the quarter was negative $9 billion. When you add the benefit of our planned liquidity actions, the total cash burn for the quarter was $7.8 billion, in line with the scenario of the burn of $7 billion to $9 billion that we provided in the last quarter. Let me give you a quick comparison of the drivers of our cash flow against the scenario that we provided. Contribution from vehicle sales, aftersales and OnStar was $4.5 billion and was better than the scenario that I laid out last quarter. Monthly cash costs of $1.5 billion and CapEx of $1.1 billion were also better than expected. Working capital unwind of $5 billion was higher than expectations since supply chain constraints in Mexico pushed some of our North American production to later in June. Sales allowance unwind of $3 billion was at the high end of the scenario due to better-than-expected retail sales performance. China and GMF dividends of $900 million was in line with expectations. So when you put all of this together, excluding managed working capital, Q2 cash flow was a burn of $1 billion, which aligns with our breakeven scenario that we have talked about. It's important to note that we have implemented significant austerity measures in this extreme environment. And as such, this is not a quarter to run rate on a go-forward basis. Let me touch on the regions, starting with North America. While retail sales performance was down 24% year-over-year, retail market share of full-size pickups improved from 35% to 36.1% despite lean inventories. Our inventory levels remained lean at 480,000 units as of July 25 compared to 810,000 units at the end of Q2 of last year and 418,000 units at our low point in early June. We continue to rebuild our pickup truck inventories, which stood at 120,000 units as of July 25. This compares to 270,000 units last June and 87,000 units at our low point. We continue to take a number of actions to increase production and replenish dealer inventories. We have returned to a normalized run rate in all of our full-size truck plants and are matching supply with demand in our remaining facilities, building inventory where we need it the most. Our dealers are doing a great job of selling deep into their inventory, and there are many initiatives underway to optimize logistics so we can rebuild our inventory faster. We're also disciplined from a go-to-market standpoint with light-duty ATPs up over $1,000 per unit quarter-over-quarter. This is driven by low incentives as well as rich mix. Our full-size SUV launch is going very well, and we're able to take advantage of downtime in May to retool. This has allowed for a smoother transition and the opportunity to produce through the traditional July shutdown. While we're still experiencing ramp-up constraints due to simultaneous SUV launches at the same plant, working through July provided an opportunity to build units that would have otherwise been lost. The customer feedback to the new SUVs has been very strong, and the vehicles have a very quick average turn at the dealer lot and the trim mix has been very rich as well. Our new heavy-duty trucks are also performing exceptionally well with ATPs up $4,000 year-over-year and U.S. retail market share of 35%, up 5 percentage points year-over-year. We're also seeing a strong trim mix with Denali and AT4 mix of over 70% for the Sierra and LTZ and High Country mix of near 60% for the Chevrolet. As we mentioned in February, these strong launches will continue to serve as a tailwind to North American profitability. Let's move to GM International. China equity income in Q2 was approximately $200 million as the market showed signs of recovery and we benefited from our recent launches. We also continued with our cost reduction measures. For H1, we achieved breakeven equity income despite the impact of the virus and the wholesales being down 32% year-over-year. Our sales continue to recover, and we expect to maintain the approximately $200 million quarterly equity income run rate. We expect China earnings to improve over time as we introduce new SUV and luxury models and benefit from an eventual industry recovery. We received $500 million in dividends from China operations in Q2 and expect the remaining dividends in the second half of this year. In South America, we experienced lower production related to the pandemic, and the FX environment has become more challenging. However, we're continuing to strengthen the business and take costs out. Our first 2 vehicles on our new platform, the Onix B car and the Tracker B SUV have been well received by the Brazilian market. These new vehicles have helped increase our segment share and are retail leaders in their respective segments. We're focused on channel mix in South America, taking a close look at entries and channels that do not achieve our margin objectives and redirecting volume towards profitable channels. Furthermore, we're continuing to take price, especially in Brazil, to offset the impact of FX. As an example, year-to-date, we've taken price increases of 10%, and competition is following. So we're really attacking this on the revenue side as well as the cost side, with all the austerity measures we've taken, which will get the business closer to breakeven. Let me make a few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and Corp segment. At GMF, the actions we've taken to drive dealer traffic led to strong vehicle sales and U.S. penetration of 53%, up from 47% a year ago. GMF's $200 million EBT was lower year-over-year because of higher credit provisions and accelerated depreciation on the lease portfolio due to the pandemic. In Q1, we had talked about a 7% to 10% decline in used vehicle prices. Given the significant recovery in prices starting in second half of Q2, industry consensus now points to a slightly stronger used vehicle price environment down 6% to 8%. And we continue to expect net charge-offs in the range of 2% to 2.5%, although towards the low end of the range if recent credit performance persists. We received the expected $400 million dividend from GM Financial in Q2. Cruise costs were $200 million for the quarter, consistent with expectations. And Corp segment costs were $200 million, including a $100 million favorable impact from the PSA investment. Quick update on our transformational cost savings initiatives. We achieved $3.8 billion since 2018, including $200 million in Q2, and we expect to achieve our target of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. On the cost front, zero-based budgeting has allowed us the opportunity to reevaluate our spending across the board. A significant majority of the austerity measures will normalize, as you can expect. We do think that some of these efficiencies will stick. It is too soon to put a dollar amount on that, but some examples include efficient marketing spending, reduced event expenses and reduced travel and facilities expenses. Finally, looking ahead to the second half of 2020, as you know, the environment remains fluid, and it is difficult to provide an official guidance in this backdrop. But let me frame up a scenario to dimension our profit and our cash flow. If you assume a 14 million U.S. light vehicle SAAR industry in H2, in which global production is not impacted by plant shutdowns or shift reductions and we do not experience a significant supply disruption and we rebuild dealer inventory to be in the neighborhood of 600,000 units by end of the year, we can expect second half total company EBIT adjusted to be in the range of 4 to 4.5 -- excuse me, $4 billion to $5 billion, with Q3 slightly stronger than Q4 due to holidays in November and December. In this scenario, we expect to generate free cash flow of $7 billion to $9 billion in H2, assuming a working capital and sales allowance rewind of approximately $5 billion and CapEx of approximately $3 billion. The H2 scenario demonstrates the ability to recover a meaningful portion of the H1 cash burn. Keep in mind, this is a scenario, not a guidance, and these factors are inherently difficult to predict given the volatility in demand and production timing as well as levels. As you know, there are a number of factors such as inventory build, managed working capital rewind, austerity measures that will make it difficult to use this scenario to extrapolate into 2021. But we're confident in the fundamentals of the business. And in a normal environment, we would expect the cash flow generation potential of the company to be strong as we keep funding the investments in our future. It is also worth noting that the deferment in CapEx spending this year will lead to retime spending into 2021. However, over the 2-year period, we expect to still stay within our CapEx target. So in summary, our Q2 results were significantly impacted by the pandemic, but we're demonstrating how well we can perform through a challenging time. Our focus on cash flow and the steps we've taken to improve the breakeven has certainly helped improve the resilience of the business. We continue to be laser focused on execution and generating strong performance that will position us to win in the future of mobility. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Dhivya, maybe just to clarify that last comment on the back half EBIT, was that -- is that an auto EBIT or a total EBIT? And maybe if you could provide a little bit more color or what the implied North America EBIT would be in the back half. Dhivya Suryadevara : So Joe, it is total company EBIT. So it includes auto as well as GMF. I don't want to put a specific North America number to it, but it's safe to assume that, with a 600,000-unit dealer inventory position by year-end, I think that gives you enough data points to model North America in specific. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then you talked about the cash flow in the back half. I think in some other comments, you talked about potentially paying back the revolver of $60 million. So -- $16 billion. So if I'm doing the math right, it sort of seems that, if that occurs, you're back to net cash balances almost equal to, let's call it, second quarter of '19 levels or pre-strike, pre-COVID. Am I missing anything there? Or are there any other puts and takes we should be considering? Dhivya Suryadevara : I think you're directionally correct. If you think about the first half of the year, we burned $10 billion between Q1 and Q2. And based on the scenario that I provided, in the midpoint of the range of the $7 billion to $9 billion, you can see that we're recovering a bulk of the burn in H1 of the year. So as we build the cash balance back towards our target level, Joe, that's when we would expect to pay back the revolver. Obviously, as you know, there's a ton of uncertainty that's out there. So it's important to note that it's based on the backdrop and all the assumptions that I talked about. Joseph Spak : Okay. And maybe one for Mary. You talk a lot about your EV and Ultium architecture, and it sounds like you're very comfortable and excited about it. I know you have an agreement with Honda for that as well. But what we're also seeing is a lot more companies, I guess, trying to maybe break into electric vehicles or automating them. I'm wondering if you would ever consider -- or how you would sort of value the risk and opportunities, I guess, of selling kits to some of the would-be competitors. Mary Barra : We think scale does matter, and we are very confident and excited about our Ultium battery platform and our cell technology. We are the only 1 of 2 that are building battery cells in this country from an auto perspective. And we also have a joint development agreement with LG Chem, along with the R&D work that we have. We've stated that as we -- early -- in the early days of launching off of our new Ultium platform, we will be at or below 100. And that's just the start of the cost-down plans that we have from a battery cell technology perspective. So we, as you mentioned, have an arrangement with Honda to provide and leverage not only Ultium cells, but our platform, and we evaluate each one of these opportunities on an individual basis. So we think it's going to be something that's additive and generate shareholder value but doesn't have a negative impact on the core business. We definitely will protect our truck franchise. And other key franchises, we will evaluate. So we remain open as we move forward because we think we have leading technology. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Just a first question on the strength in pricing in the quarter. I mean, obviously, with inventory relatively tight, that should have aided that. So I think that, that might be part of it. But just curious how much of that price increase you think is sticky, how much benefit you'll get as the SUVs launch. And then also, if you think about the relatively tight inventory right now and today, you're talking about getting back to 600,000 units, which is still relatively tight through the end of the year, might you consider a leaner inventory level going forward to support pricing? Mary Barra : Yes. John, I'd say on -- in the quarter, it was both carryover as well as our majors that contributed to positive pricing. On the major side, as you know, we're launching our Trailblazer and Encore GX, which have been received really well, and that's helping us from a net price perspective. On the carryover side, it's across the board, but particularly in full-size pickups that we're able to maintain the pricing levels there. And as we go forward, to your point, we will calibrate the right level of inventory to have based on what the SAAR environment is like. As you know, it's a needle that you've got to thread, watching what the competition is doing, our own inventory levels and the appropriate trade-off between market share as well as profitability. And that's something that we manage on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and we'll continue to do that in the second half of the year and beyond. John Murphy : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a second question, on the $1.5 billion in cost saves in the quarter, I mean, I think in the press release, you're saying that takes you up to $3.8 billion. So you're pretty far along the way getting to the $4 billion to $4.5 billion. So I'm just curious how much of that was somewhat temporary in the quarter and there might be more to go. And I guess it's sort of just a question of semantics and timing. And as you kind of chug down this route of crossing the finish line of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, if there is potentially more down the line. Or are you guys just running so efficiently you're kind of reaching sort of an [indiscernible] limit on how far it can go on cost? I mean it's pretty impressive. It seems like you might be bumping up against limits here at this point. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. So from a $3.8 billion that you alluded to, John, I'd say those are permanent savings in that they were part of what we announced in November of 2018, and we've been making progress getting to the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range that we've talked about. So I would categorize those as more permanent savings. In addition to that, the austerity savings that we put in place in the second quarter given the pandemic and what's going on, that's where -- you got to look at it in two categories. First category, naturally, there will be a normalization of that with the production going back up. So for example, to the extent there are salary deferrals that we have announced recently that we're restoring those to the original levels, those were temporary. So we went back to the original levels there. So with the normalization, you will see a significant majority of that going back. But what we're also working on is, whether it's marketing spend or event expenses and travel, as you can imagine, as the low facilities and other areas, we're looking at every single one of them from a zero-based perspective to do more there. So as I said, it's difficult to put a dollar amount, but it's safe to say you've seen the performance in the quarter from a cost standpoint. If there's cost efficiencies to be had, we will get it. John Murphy : Okay. And then just lastly, on the OnStar discussion, I mean, moving it towards an app on the phone that's available outside the vehicle, seems like you're taking this more and more in sort of a stand-alone direction. Just curious really what that means, if it's going to be available to folks outside of the GM family. And could this be a precursor to a potential separation at some point down the line? Mary Barra : So John, I think what we're really looking is at leveraging the full power of OnStar and the connectivity we have, the relationship we have with first responders throughout the country, and we think it's a very additive business. There's a lot more that we plan to do, building on OnStar that will be integrated with the vehicle. So we'll look at both paths but have nothing to talk about related to the separation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : So bear with me on the first question. The General Motors brand, I think, goes back 111 years. What do you think -- why not just change the name of the company? I mean it's done -- GM is -- the General Motors has done its job, but it -- I'm wondering if it might be out of touch with some of the really interesting directions you're taking the business. Why not call the company Ultium, the entire company? And I have a follow-up. Mary Barra : So Adam, appreciate your input. When I look at a name change -- and we're going to make any changes necessary to drive the shareholder value because I'm so -- strongly believe in the technology and our future product plans as it relates to electrification. So that's something that we evaluate and look at, when is the right time and what are the proof points that everybody looks at it and makes it real. And so we believe strongly in our EV future. Adam Jonas : Okay. Appreciate that, Mary. Just a follow-up then. Because as you realize, there's so much investor enthusiasm around the high -- the 20% CAGR business known as EVs and not so much excitement around the negative 5% or so CAGR business. That's the melting ice cube, so to speak. And the valuations of some of the other companies that are going after the higher-growth business are just so sensational. I mean people talk about Rivian worth more than GM and they never made a vehicle. So I'm just thinking, from GM and to a large degree, your peers, because you're not alone, as you look at like today's results, really, really good results under tough circumstances, a decent set of guidance under tough circumstances, the market doesn't seem to care. From your seat, what is the biggest reason for this gap? It's a pretty big gap. Again, I'm not singling you out specifically, but you are the CEO of this company that many investors see as a real opportunity here. And I'm one of that group. What's the biggest reason, in your mind, for the gap? And what does GM need to do to radically change that perception? Mary Barra : And so when I look at all the attention on some of the companies that you mentioned, I think it's a validation of the importance of the electrification strategy. I think as we move forward, people will see all the strengths we bring as it relates to scale manufacturing capability, the technology that we're bringing, leading battery costs. So we've got to keep telling our story. We've got to deliver, and that's exactly what we intend to do. We have the Lyriq announcement next week, which is one of the highest clinic vehicles I've seen in my 40-year career from a customer perspective. We have more to share very shortly on the HUMMER and as I said, the reveal in fourth quarter. The battery plant is raising steel today. So we're just going to keep delivering and demonstrate that we have products people want to buy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Dhivya, I think you mentioned this in the outlook commentary, but how much roughly of the working capital and accrued do you expect to recover by year-end, even if we go back to last year's strike? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. So we're assuming, Itay, in the outlook of a recovery of about $5 billion from a working capital and sales loans perspective. So we're not all the way back from a recovery of the cash burn that we experienced in first half as it relates to working capital. And that will happen as the industry continues to normalize. So as -- and a way to think about it is at 17 million units, if you're roughly neutral working capital and we saw the burn first half of the year, as it gets closer to 17 million, it's almost like a linear way of thinking about it getting back to the neutral levels. And as you know, it's also based on timing of production and the levels of production as well. Itay Michaeli : Great. That's helpful. And then just -- you mentioned the COVID situation and the rising cases. I'm just curious if you're seeing any signs, whether it's globally, nationally or even by region, of any recent signs of retail demand weakness just in light of the recent events? Mary Barra : No, not really, Itay. We're cautiously optimistic as we see month-over-month improvement in China, as we see continued improvement in the United States and North America, and we expect a bit slower recovery due to the severity of COVID in South America. Itay Michaeli : Okay. And then just lastly, Mary, I know in the past, we spoke about and you've spoken about the opportunity for EVs to deploy them on rideshare networks. And wondering if there's any updated views on that, particularly with one of the rideshare companies in the past few months committing to an all-EV fleet by 2030. Just curious if there's any other updated thoughts around how you might look to deploy EVs on rideshare networks? Mary Barra : I think that's an opportunity for us. And I don't have anything specifically to announce today, but very much an opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Question, the performance in North America really stands out as very impressive. Just looking at the year-over-year change in EBIT divided by the year-over-year change in revenue, it would seem that decremental margin tracked somewhere in the order of 19%, $3.1 billion declining EBIT on $16.7 billion in revenue versus -- in most other quarters, I think operating leverage has been quite a bit higher. So clearly, this seems a result of the $1.4 billion of cost or $1.3 billion of performance there in the quarter. Are you able to sort of break down that cost improvement for us to help us maybe better understand how much of that cost cutting represents expenses that you have found maybe don't need to be added back as volume returns versus, I don't know, other cuts, which are maybe less sustainable? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. It's difficult, Ryan, to put a dollar amount on this, but a portion of the cost in the bridge, I would say, is timing, call it, about $500 million or so, which will get retimed into a different time period, maybe H2 or into next year. And I think as you think about margins though, what you're seeing really in North America is quickly being able to flex our cost structure but also the product trend as well that we're seeing. As you think about future margins for North America, we're going to have the launch downtime behind us from both an SUV and heavy-duty perspective. Last 3 years, if you think about it, we've been taking downtime to change over the entire portfolio. So as you go forward here, you think about lack of downtime, whatever sticks from a cost perspective on efficiencies and continued execution of the transformational cost savings. So you see some tailwinds here, and this quarter certainly demonstrates that you're seeing what the earnings power of North America can be. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. And then if you would just sort of add it all together, when you take the, I don't know, learning to be leaner and then the costs that do need to come back and maybe considering also any sort of post-COVID costs such as PPE for your employees or supply chain compression, would you say that your outlook today for long-term GM North America margin of 10% plus is lower, higher or unchanged relative to prior to coronavirus? Mary Barra : I would say it's unchanged. I think the -- we obviously are focused on safety and providing the right equipment, but I think we've been able to do that very efficiently along with other COVID costs and I see more cost opportunity as we move forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : So Mary, when you look at the high market valuations and cheap access to capital of some of these electric vehicle companies we spoke about earlier, some established ones, but also many unproven start-ups, can that make you consider spinning off GM's electric vehicle operations and capability into a separate stand-alone entity? There seems to be large investor appetite for such assets as we discussed before. But this cheap access to capital has frankly also become a strong competitive advantage for some of these companies. Mary Barra : Emmanuel, we are evaluating and always evaluate many different scenarios, so I don't have anything further to say other than we are open to looking at and evaluate anything that we think is going to drive long-term shareholder value. So I would say nothing is off the table. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. I guess are there any technology or other sort of impediments or the way sort of like things are integrated together, makes it complicated? Can you just talk a little bit about sort of like the factors that come into consideration? Mary Barra : I'm not sure I -- your question -- it was hard to hear you, but I think you asked, is there -- what are any potential impediments. And I don't look at things as impediments. I look at what is going to be the way to maximize the value creation. So I think there's many different costs that we are looking at that we could take. It all starts, though, with strong execution and building on the technical capability we have as well as our supply chains and our manufacturing capabilities. So I don't really see any specific impediment. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then for Dhivya, I was hoping to put your second half scenario, EBIT scenario in historical context. Obviously, it's a very strong outlook under that scenario. But at the same time, historically, there's been many half years where GM has done as well or better, first half of 2019, first half of '18, second half of '18. But since then, you've taken out a tremendous amount of cost. And yes, the market is much lower, but your truck production is expected to be running all out. The pricing is great for the product that really matter for GM. It feels like there's a lot of upside versus back then. So can you maybe just put into context with puts and takes? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes, sure. So you will still have in the second half of the year a couple of headwinds as it relates to -- wholesales will be down relative to what might have been a kind of adjusted second half of last year, a normal type environment. So depending on where the industry lands and our ability to fully recoup production, it depends on that. Secondly, GMF is projecting a 6% to 8% decline in used vehicle prices and a higher consumer loss number. And to the extent that, that comes in at the better end of the range, there could be some GMF opportunity there. So even though production is running all out, it is not quite back at the levels, that pre-COVID ability to run all out and especially in some of the international markets that Mary is talking about. We might still have some production levels that are lower than pre-COVID. So GMF, production levels, and I think it's safe to say that a normal second half would be, if you don't have downtime, production is back at the normal levels and the credit losses and huge vehicle prices normalize. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : So maybe you could talk about the margin implications for the company as the mix shifts towards EVs in the near and intermediate term. And are there any milestones investors should be monitoring in order to gauge when the shift to EVs will be neutral to your margins? Some milestones in terms of where battery costs may need to be -- or certain volume of EVs that the company may need to ship? Mary Barra : Well, as I've mentioned, we start rolling out off of our Ultium platform and cell system next year with the HUMMER EV and then continue. And early in that life, we think we're going to get to 100 and below, and then we have a fairly rapid plan to continue to take cost out. So I think it will happen over the life of that program that we'll be able to see the costs and depending on the ICE powertrain, get to a parity point through that generation. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. And my follow-up question was around this down 6% to 8% used vehicle pricing that, Dhivya, you had mentioned. Can you talk a little bit more about how GM is coming up with that? I think some of the investors observed used pricing coming in stronger than that more recently. So just some context to how you're thinking about used pricing within that number that you quoted would be helpful. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. That is a very good point. We are seeing strong recovery after the low point in April. And we are looking to be more on the conservative side. A few reasons. Clearly, the macro backdrop is a question mark at this point. And there's always seasonality in the second half of the year. There's increased off-lease supply coming from the lease extensions that we have seen in the first half of the year. Rental car companies are defleeting. There's also -- new vehicle inventories are starting to increase, as we just talked about. So when you put all that together, we just think it's appropriate to be conservative. And clearly, if you're going to see a continued strength in the used vehicle prices as we have seen in the last few months, that represents an upside over what I talked about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Dhivya, I was hoping you can just clarify a couple of points here on the -- not guidance, but scenario that you laid out for the back half. You said $4 billion to $5 billion of EBIT in the back half. I think the sum of GM International, GMF, Cruise and Corp, it's probably around $1 billion negative. So that would imply $5 billion to $6 billion from North America with some inventory and the cost structure that, I assume, eliminates some of the temporary stuff. Is that what you're saying? And it seems like that would include about $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion of inventory building. So maybe $3.5 billion, $4.5 billion at a 14 billion -- 14 million unit market. Is that kind of a reasonable interpretation? Dhivya Suryadevara : So Rod, it's difficult to look at this on a regional basis. There's so much puts and takes across regions as well. But I think what you're trying to get to is what might a normalized underlying free cash flow potential of the company might be. And if assuming that's what you're trying to get to from the second half scenario that I provided, a simple way to think about it is we -- at the beginning of this year, when we were expecting a 17 million SAAR environment, we guided to $7 billion of free cash flow. And we also said last quarter that if you had a 13 million U.S. SAAR, that's the point at which we would break even from a free cash flow perspective globally. So that gives you sort of like the boundaries from a free cash flow standpoint. And depending on whatever demand environment you can come up with, you can interpolate between those points. The key takeaway I'm trying to communicate here is the underlying cash generation potential of the business remains intact with the pre-COVID levels. And that's how to think about it. And obviously, you're going to see on a quarter-to-quarter some volatility associated with their production or working capital assumption or sales allowances and so on. But if you take a giant step back and think about what's changed since pre-COVID, we would say the business is strong, the important product launches are behind us and they're performing really well. Austerity, if anything, to Mary's point, is going to add to some level of bottom line. And importantly, we've been talking about cash conversion for a couple of years now. And we're continuing to execute on those cash conversion measures and taking more dividends from GMF and so on. So we are -- I'd say that the business is intact, and that's how you should read into the numbers that I provided from a scenario standpoint. Rod Lache : Okay. Yes, and it's pretty clear. You explained -- it sounds like $2 billion to $4 billion in the back half ex working capital but with some inventory build. How should we be thinking about -- obviously, macro is going to be the biggest driver of the variance from this year to next year. But the things that are within your control, Thailand and Australia, I think you've quantified, is about $400 million. You suggested on the call that you can get South America closer to breakeven. How should we be thinking about some of those items as we look out to next year? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I'd say, macro aside, the key tailwind will be the product downtime that I mentioned earlier. You saw that in each of the last few years, and we're not going to have that. We're going to have a full year of COVID sales. Adjacencies have been growing, as you've seen, both from an OnStar as well as an aftersales perspective. That's going to continue into 2021. And the GMI restructuring is on track with the actions we've already announced. South America, as I mentioned, we've been inching towards both the breakeven with both the revenue side as well as the cost side. Again, I won't put a time line on it, but it's all hands on deck from a South America perspective. So from a controllable standpoint, I would say we are on the right side of all of those initiatives in all the regions. And as we look into 2021, from a cash flow standpoint, I think all of those will serve us as our stronghold for next year. Rod Lache : Okay. Great. And just lastly, was hoping maybe you could just address, Mary, that -- just the status of the China business right now. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that, especially luxury, seems to be coming back. But seems like Cadillac was still underperforming the market a bit as we looked at the last quarter. What do you see in that market at the moment? And what's your view on the prospects from here? Mary Barra : I think we see an opportunity to continue to improve that business. Clearly, there continues to be ongoing pricing pressures, but we do have a strong cadence of new launches that -- I mentioned a few of them. We also addressed the issue and added the 4-cylinder engine options that I think inhibited some of our progress at the end of last year. So very important that we add the four cylinders. And then, obviously, the region stays very disciplined on cost. So as I look at the strength of Buick, we have seen progress in Cadillac. I agree with you that we can and we will do more. So I see an opportunity. For this year, we kind of said that assuming kind of the trajectory that we're on, we'll continue to maintain the roughly $200 million per quarter, but I see upside opportunity as we move forward. And as you go even further, when you look at the recovery of that market and the ability of the market to get to a 30 million type unit and our planned portfolio for NEVs, I think, in the medium term, there's even more opportunity for growth and profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. A couple of questions. So if we think of a chart you used to put out sort of in the 2012, 2013 period, you showed North America, fixed cost base. If I just do the math of subtracting about $10,000 per vehicle of variable contribution from your $11 billion of revenue, I get to sort of $8 billion of cost times 4 is $32 billion. Can you update us on a couple of things? A, is that in the ballpark for your new fixed cost bases in North America? Two, of the cost reduction, how much was the fixed cost and how much was things like supplier price concessions or redesigning bill of materials and so forth? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I'd say, Brian, the number that you came up with is probably on the higher side. I'd say it's lower than that. And part of it is actions we've taken with the transformational cost savings. If you think about it from the 2012, 2013 time frame that you're alluding to, we have been consistently taking fixed cost out of the system so the -- I think you can reduce your number by -- at least the transformational cost savings is not higher to get to a lower number. And the second question, a lot of the austerity actions were on the fixed cost side. So I'll give you a few examples. Marketing spend typically goes into this bucket of fixed cost that you're talking about, that was lower. A lot of the salary deferrals as well as pay-related items typically fall into fixed costs as well. That was lower travel and sundry expenses, typically fixed costs. So it's less about extracting more variable concessions out of the system and more about these kinds of austerity actions that I talked about. Hopefully, that's helpful. Brian Johnson : And as we kind of go into '21, assuming things somewhat normalize in the world, how much of those fixed costs come back? Dhivya Suryadevara : That's the challenge, I'd say. The transformational cost savings assume that those are permanent, and we will continue to move towards the $4 billion to $4.5 billion. So that's a -- if anything, it will be on the high end of that range. And from a regular austerity perspective, whether it's salaried or the hourly pay and so on, clearly, as we're restoring activity, that's going to come back. And the rest of the fixed cost, to see what we can do to make it stick, obviously, when we give 2021 guidance and more color at that time, we'll be able to talk more about the cost environment. But really, from a number standpoint, it's just too soon. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then just final question. Over on GM Financial, delinquencies were in good shape, but throughout the consumer finance industry, there are forbearance agreements with customers. Can you update us on where GM Financial closes forbearance and as opposed to risk to delinquencies as we move into -- further into the fall? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. It's actually been very much on track. We've seen a slight pickup in -- earlier in the quarter towards the April time frame. And actually, in the second half of the quarter, the numbers were starting to trend back down again. So we've been watching all of these numbers closely. We've looked at late fees and all the payment deferrals. And we've seen that, across the board, all these metrics are decreasing from the peak we saw in April and were returning closer to the normal levels by July. And obviously, we're being conservative about it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Dan Levy : So first, just wanted to ask a question on inventory levels. I know you're saying a target of 600,000 by year-end. But if I look at the 2018, 2019 period, your typical month-end inventory was typically around like 800,000 units. And I know we're not in a 17 million SAAR. But what's a fair rebuild to assume over time beyond year-end? I assume that the 600,000 does reflect production constraints and isn't a target inventory per se. Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. So 600,000, to your point, is based on a second half environment of closer to 14 million light vehicle SAAR that I alluded to. So we will calibrate this based on the demand level that we see. And to the extent that the industry is trending stronger, we will look to get back to the levels that are in the range, I would say, of what you just alluded to. Clearly, from a truck standpoint, we will be limited by production capabilities as well since we're already running all out. And we are taking all the measures we can to increase or add to production levels on trucks as much as possible. And I think if we calibrate it to an appropriate industry level, you will see that 600,000 number start to go back up again. Dan Levy : Okay. Great. And just as a follow-up, you've talked about -- I know you reaffirmed today the North America EBIT breakeven and SAAR of 10 million to 11 million. You just did total company breakeven with your North America volume down 60%. SAAR down 60% is 7 million, a lot better than 10 million to 11 million. So why isn't your breakeven better than the 10 million to 11 million you've highlighted? And given the resiliency of mix, is there potential to see a 10% margin in a SAAR environment below 17 million? Or is there something that we're missing? Is it just about EV development expenses coming online? What's -- what are we missing there? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. So if you just take this quarter's results and look at wholesale inside SAAR, if you will, wholesales were down 62%. That would imply a SAAR of about 7 million units. And the reason it is so much better than the 10 million to 11 million units is we were able to take a very significant, almost extreme, austerity actions given that our production basically ground to a standstill. And you can ask yourself the question, if it's more of a, call it, normal downturn and everything is continuing, but demand is lower, how much of those levers will you be able to pull. I think -- we think some of them would be difficult to pull when production is actually ongoing. So austerity will be dependent on the nature of the downturn. And secondly, you saw what pricing did this quarter. Inventories were low. And the -- both the carryover pricing as well as the new vehicle pricing held up very well in this environment. And you're going to have to tell me what assumptions you make during a normal downturn to see if pricing levels would hold up at that level or not. So look, we are going to continue to drive the breakeven level down. And we're not settling comfortably at 10 million to 11 million. We're going to push that down as much as possible. What we're not doing is using this particular unusual circumstance to revise a formal breakeven point to a different level. Having said that, we will work through to do that as much as we can. Dan Levy : Okay. If I could just squeeze in one more on the product side. Can you just talk about your presence in off-road? We're obviously seeing a lot of excitement given the product actions of some of your competitors. So how much of a priority is off-road for you? And what are your plans with AT4? Would you expand AT4 beyond GMC to the Chevy brand? Mary Barra : I think we look at each brand and are continuing to build on our off-road offerings in GMC as well as Chevrolet. And then I think when you look to HUMMER, you'll see a true capability there as well. So we think it's very important. It's important to customers and we'll continue to expand our offerings. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Christopher McNally : Fantastic results, guys, and thanks for the second half framework. So real quick, one strategic and one on the numbers. So sort of in the spirit of some of the other EV questions, you have 12 upcoming models, but I think many industry participants believe that this may only be incremental progress and not really big leaps in -- particularly in design. And we even have trouble pointing to one of those vehicles, which could be sort of 100,000 plus. So my question, would you mind just sharing what you think is GM's chance of -- or the best chance of a high-unit EV program versus, let's say, a new product, which is more of a wide portfolio approach to EV? Mary Barra : Well, I think if you step back and you look at what we've shared at our EV Day in March is we have -- with the new Ultium cell and platform technology, we have the BET, the -- our battery electric truck offerings; and then our BEV, which, I'll say, kind of mainstream and then our BEV plus that allow us to do expressive vehicles. There's huge sharing between those three platforms that are foundational for the portfolio that we have coming forward. We do have a full portfolio plan to cover high-volume segments. I think when you see -- to start with the Cadillac Lyriq and then the truck portfolio we have planned, you'll see that we plan on participating in a very significant way. And I think you'll see design and technology back it up to truly be tapping into what the customer wants, expects and the excitement that it will bring. Christopher McNally : But Mary, is it fair to say that it's more of a portfolio approach that really no one vehicle is going to lead the charge in terms of a high number of units? Mary Barra : No, I don't think that's correct. I think that we have some entries that are in the sweet spot of key segments that are large segments, and we intend to get our fair share plus more. So it won't be on the fringes. It will be mainstream. Christopher McNally : Okay. Great. And then just one real quick one on the second half numbers. Is it fair to assume that the mix component should turn positive again in Q3 and Q4, even despite you have the tough comp of the HD launch last year, but obviously, you have the new SUV launch this year? So can we see mix turn positive as well as volumes in second half? Dhivya Suryadevara : Yes. I think there's a few mix components. Obviously, truck and full-size SUV production, it is going to drive favorability from a mix standpoint. And I wasn't sure whether you're talking about '19 numbers adjusted or unadjusted for the labor disruption or not. But in terms of volume, we're going to see full-size SUV ramp back up and that's generally favorable to mix. And the other aspect is trim mix. And we're seeing, as I mentioned, AT4, Denali and LTZ and High Country mix trending very high. And typically, when those are strong -- these are more profitable vehicles, and those tend to be a tailwind as well from a mix standpoint. So both vehicle mix as well as trim mix driven by full-size trucks as well as full-size SUVs more specifically should generally be favorable to mix as we go forward in the next few quarters. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Again, thanks, everybody, for joining today. We recognize that we're at a critical point for General Motors, our company. We know from an industry perspective and frankly, the world, as you look at the virus. We are committed to leading through the current challenges and into the future to provide a very strong future. We are determined to run the business in a way that creates the value our shareholders deserve and with outstanding vehicles. For those who attended our EV Day, the comments we had on the design and technology coming was very, very strong. We need to continue to share that much more broadly, and we will. And we also are very focused on technology and having customer-centered innovations like Super Cruise, which is an important step as we bring self-driving vehicles to market. I hope you understand we are very focused on our work from an EV and an AV perspective and believe that will deliver not only growth, but profitable growth, and ultimately help us achieve our vision of creating a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. And I know many of you are eagerly awaiting to see more of our EV plan. So in addition to the launch that we have next week on the Lyriq, at 11 :00 a.m. today, we are posting a video to our IR and media websites spotlighting the upcoming GMC HUMMER EV. It's not a complete reveal, but it's more information, and we believe it is truly the world's first super truck. So we hope you'll take some time to take a look. And thank you again for your time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Thursday, November 5, 2020.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Erica. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2020. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast.  I'm joined here today at GM's Tech Center by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; John Stapleton, GM's acting CFO. And on the line, we have Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to our usual forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of the call will be governed by this language.  I'll now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rocky, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call today. This morning, I'll cover a few key areas of the business. I'll start with a brief snapshot of our record third quarter earnings, and then I'll follow with a more in-depth look at the rapid progress we're making in electrification. I'll wrap up by touching on our regional businesses, and then John will provide a deeper look at the numbers before we go to your questions.  But before I do that, I know everyone on the call is closely watching and waiting for the final vote count in the U.S. presidential election. From our perspective, General Motors is ready to work with whichever candidate is certified as the winner, along with their administration and the new Congress. And we will continue to invest in our U.S. operations and pursue our growth initiatives, especially in the areas of electrification and autonomous vehicles.  I also want to take a moment to recognize the tireless efforts of our employees around the world. Whether working remotely or in the workplace, they are keeping our programs fully on track, building every vehicle they can safely and with quality. In addition, our suppliers are moving mountains to keep their operations open so we can keep production going, and our dealers are embracing creative new ways to interact safely with our customers for service parts and sales. That has truly been remarkable and inspiring to see how everyone has come together to safely restart our operations with the health and safety of our teams and our customers as the number one priority.  Our multilayered approach to COVID-19 safety has proven effective in preventing the spread of disease around all of our facilities. Where our protocols are followed, they are working. This is an extraordinary effort, and our continued focus on employee health and safety has been important as economies begin to recover around the world.  Finally, I'm very pleased to share that GM Canada and Unifor have reached a tentative agreement on our new labor contract, which is very good news for our team, our customers, our dealers and our investors. As you know, we have been operating our full-size pickup plants around the clock to meet exceptionally robust demand for the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra in the United States and Canada. The fact is we simply can't build enough. And because we expect demand to remain strong, we must increase our capacity. That is why, subject to ratification, GM plans to invest approximately CAD 1 billion to bring full-size pickup production back to the Oshawa assembly plant while making new investments at St. Catharines propulsion plant and the Woodstock parts operation. We will move very quickly. We expect construction to begin on the new body shop and flexible assembly module at Oshawa immediately upon ratification. When the plant comes back online in early 2022, we will see a significant increase in our full-size pickup production capacity. We look forward to sharing more details about this plant after ratification, which should occur over the next several days.  Now let's turn to our Q3 results, which were driven primarily by the success of our safety protocols around the world; a stronger and faster-than-expected industry recovery in the U.S. and China; strong U.S. retail sales and market share, especially for pickups, with higher pricing and disciplined incentives; and the successful launch of our all-new full-size Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac SUVs. We also clearly benefited from austerity measures we implemented in response to the pandemic and the ongoing transformational-related cost reductions.  Looking at the numbers. We delivered net revenue of $35.5 billion, EBIT-adjusted of $5.3 billion, EBIT-adjusted margin of 14.9%, EPS diluted adjusted of $2.83, adjusted automotive free cash flow of $9.1 billion and a ROIC adjusted of 9.7% on a trailing 4-quarter basis. These results are providing capital for our EV and our AV growth initiatives, and they demonstrate the underlying strength and resiliency of our business.  This year and this quarter, in particular, you can clearly see how we are rapidly transforming our company to lead in EVs by leveraging our iconic brands, technological innovation, manufacturing capability and scale in a way that will change the way customers and our investors view our company.  The foundation is our flexible and highly scalable Ultium architecture, battery and propulsion system, which have empowered our designers and given them free rein to reimagine our approach to interior and exterior design. You can see this in the powerful, distinctive and beautifully executed vehicles like the GMC Hummer EV and the Cadillac Lyriq. The simplicity of Ultium and the use of virtual engineering have made us more agile. From inception to production, the Hummer EV represents the fastest vehicle development program in GM's recent history. We took reservations during its reveal, and demand exceeded our expectations.  Our manufacturing strategy is also coming into sharper focus. Construction of the Ultium Cells LLC manufacturing facility in Lordstown, Ohio, where we will make battery cells with our JV partner, LG Chem, is ahead of schedule. We've begun the hiring process and will add a total of 1,100 jobs to the local economy. We have also announced plans to have 3 plants producing EVs, Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck, Orion Assembly in Michigan and Spring Hill assembly in Tennessee. During the quarter, we shared even more detail about our road map to deliver EV costs comparable to internal combustion engine vehicles. For example, all of our future EVs will draw from a family of 5 interchangeable drive units and 3 motors known collectively as Ultium Drive. And we will be the first automaker to use a wireless battery management system for production of electric vehicles, with expanded over-the-air updates provided by GM's all-new vehicle intelligent platform. We will -- the system will be upgraded over time with new software-based features via smartphone-like updates. The system also reduces the cost and weight of wiring.  Looking ahead, we'll continue investing in advanced battery chemistry to drive even greater range at a lower cost for our customers. We look forward to sharing even more details about our EV portfolio and competitive advantages at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference on November 19.  Among the strategies that will help us move quickly are the partnerships we have forged with companies like Honda and EVgo. In September, we signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding with Honda to collaborate on several vehicle segments as well as on purchasing, research and development and connected services. These efficiencies will help both companies fund future mobility innovations. And to address the entire EV ecosystem for our customers, we will collaborate with EVgo to build more than 2,700 public fast chargers over the next 5 years.  Before we move on, I'd like to provide a comment about Nikola. As you're aware, we've been in ongoing discussions with Nikola about a commercial transaction. The transaction has not yet closed, and we will provide further updates at the appropriate time. We are exploring all opportunities to commercialize our Ultium battery system as well as the Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cells we have developed with Honda. We have invested heavily in developing and manufacturing fuel cells. Commercialization of our Ultium battery system and hydrogen fuel cells reflects that commitment and our commitment to a 0 emissions future.  Cruise, our majority-owned self-driving subsidiary, continues to make progress with its technology and the launch of the Cruise Origin shared autonomous vehicle, which will be built at Factory ZERO. We've begun testing the Origins' Ultium battery system at our Milford Proving Ground, with preproduction vehicles coming next year. By the end of the year, Cruise AVs will be tested in San Francisco without backup drivers after receiving the go-ahead from the California Department of Motor Vehicles. This is a significant milestone because Cruise will be the first company to test autonomous vehicles with no backup driver in a dense and complex urban driving environment.  In the coming months, GM and Cruise intend to file an exemption petition with NHTSA to deploy Origin vehicles without steering wheels or pedals. We have withdrawn an earlier exemption petition that was limited to earlier-generation Cruise AVs derived from the Chevrolet Bolt platform. The Cruise team is working with a Harvard-trained epidemiologist and using research from various health organizations to identify measures that may help maintain a healthy ride environment. Now let's take a look at our regional businesses. In North America, we gained retail market share and drove higher average transaction prices with lower incentives. Our truck and full-size SUV plants are safely operating on 3 shifts, building every vehicle possible. Our dealers are doing a great job of maximizing sales and share despite tight supply. They are using GM-developed software that helps them order the highest-demand, fastest-turning vehicle build configurations. Customers' response to our all-new full-size SUVs continues to be enthusiastic. Combined average transaction prices for the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the GMC Yukon and Yukon XL are 14% higher than outgoing models and the 3 closest competitors. Media reaction to the 2021 Cadillac Escalade, which is now arriving at dealerships, has been outstanding, with journalists citing its craftsmanship, comfort and technology, including its 38-inch OLED display. And like all of our full-size SUVs, we're selling every Escalade we can build.  This is Cadillac's first Escalade with available Super Cruise technology. For the second time, it decisively led all other active driver assistance systems in recent consumer reports testing. Over the next 3 years, Super Cruise will be available in 20 models across our brands.  GM Financial delivered record results in the quarter. Since its inception 10 years ago, GM Financial continues to grow its share of the financing business for both dealers and retail customers with very high levels of customer satisfaction.  Moving to our international operations. In China, the industry continues its recovery from the impact of COVID. GM China deliveries in the quarter grew 12% year-over-year. It is the first sales increase in 2 years and in line with overall growth we're seeing in the industry's passenger vehicle market. The luxury, mid-size and large SUV and multipurpose vehicle segments, where our launches have been focused, experienced the strongest growth.  Importantly, year-to-date sales of our new energy vehicle portfolio have more than doubled compared to last year. The Wuling Hong Guang mini EV became the best-selling EV in China during the quarter. In the next 5 years, more than 40% of our new launches in China will be new energy vehicles.  And before I turn it over to John, I have two more things to share. First, if our current recovery continues, we anticipate reinstating a dividend at the appropriate level that balances various capital allocation priorities, including our investments to accelerate EV. We know this is a high priority for our shareholders, and we're looking at timing around mid-2021. And finally, I want to welcome Paul Jacobson, our new CFO, who is joining us from Delta, on December 1. Paul will be a great addition to the GM senior team. At Delta, Paul led a global finance organization that is widely recognized as the best in the airline business. He and his team helped the company build a strong culture of teamwork and inclusion and deliver best-in-class customer experience, operational and financial excellence and disciplined capital allocation. Paul is committed to transforming this company. His experience and insights will help us accelerate our momentum, rapidly build scale for our vehicle electrification and autonomous technologies and position GM to deliver a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion.  And I also just want to personally thank John for all the work he's done as he did double duty for General Motors being the CFO for North America as well as the Corporate CFO. He did an outstanding job and should take full credit for the results in the quarter. I am grateful for his strong leadership, and I know he's anxious to return back to operations and to continue to drive the strong performance in North America. So John, thank you very much. And now I'll turn it over to you. John Stapleton : Okay. Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everybody. The third quarter was very strong, resulting in $35.5 billion in net revenue, $5.3 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 14.9% margins, $2.83 in EPS diluted adjusted and $9.1 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. The $2.83 EPS diluted adjusted includes a $0.05 gain from the revaluation of our investment in PSA. Automotive liquidity remained strong at $37.8 billion at the end of Q3, demonstrating the resilience and flexibility we have built into the business over the past few years and our ability to manage through downturns and other disruptions. In Q3, we repaid $5.2 billion of the corporate revolver draw and paid an additional $3.9 billion in October. We expect to pay the balance by the end of the year while remaining at or above our target average automotive cash balance.  We remain focused on our investment-grade balance sheet as well as our capital framework targets. Retail sales have continued to recover, with Q3 industry and GM results down less than 5% year-over-year despite limited inventories. Let's take a closer look at North America. North America delivered Q3 EBIT-adjusted of $4.4 billion, up $1.3 billion year-over-year and a 15% margin driven by strong full-size SUV and pickup truck performance, disciplined pricing, benefits from our cost actions and nonrecurrence of the $1 billion strike impact in Q3 of 2019. The launch of our all-new full-size SUVs is going extremely well and contributed favorably to the price during the quarter. Our new full-size SUVs are designed to keep GM the clear leader in a market we have dominated.  During the quarter, GMC and Chevrolet combined had a 65% share of the retail segment, and we are trending up in both share and ATPs as availability of the new models increase. Dealers and customers truly appreciate the safety features, advanced towing technology and new independent rear suspension that dramatically improves passenger comfort and cargo space.  Like we did with our full-size pickups, we are expanding model choice and trim options. This includes adding new higher-spec trims, like the AT4 package for the GMC Yukon and an exclusive interior for top-of-the-range Denali models. Similarly, we now have 6 distinctive models and have doubled the trim lineup for the 2021 Tahoe and Suburban, including the Z71 off-road package. All new SUVs also have our new vehicle intelligence platform, VIP, which is on 9 models now and will be on a total of almost 30 by 2023. With an expanded capacity for smartphone-like over-the-air software updates, the VIP system enables the adoption of functionality upgrades throughout the life of the vehicle. Like our pickups, our SUVs command high ATPs, and we intentionally planned our rollout to include a rich mix of completely redesigned full-size SUVs with a goal to drive profitability and enhance our segment-leading market share. We started deliveries of our SUVs in Q2. And since the launch, we have gained approximately 3 percentage points of market share.  Retail market share of our large pickups is also strong, up approximately 2 percentage points year-to-date through the third quarter, with Sierra, the fastest-growing nameplate in the segment. Let's move to GM International. For the third quarter, EBIT-adjusted in GMI was up $100 million year-over-year, driven by favorable price and mix, continued benefits from our transformation actions and austerity measures partially offset by weaker FX in South America. China equity income in Q3 was flat year-over-year and slightly above our $200 million expected run rate. We saw benefits from volume as the market continues to recover from H1 lows; improved mix from recent launches, including Cadillac XT6, CT4, CT5, Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Blazer; and cost discipline. The benefits were offset by continued pricing pressure. We received $500 million in dividends from our China JV in Q2 and expect the remaining $500 million to be paid in Q4. In South America, all plants are operating in line with market demand, and the team has been reducing cost to lessen the effects of the pandemic while continuing to optimize mix and aggressively take industry-leading price. These cost measures include voluntary and involuntary staff reductions, salary reductions and delayed investments. Our strong Chevrolet brand has led the market for 18 consecutive years led by Onix. The Tracker has also led its segment since its launch earlier this year. The success of both entries highlights the strength of our new global family of vehicle platform, which now represents about 2/3 of South America volume and meaningful progress in terms of profitability and localization.  A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our corp segment. GM Financial posted quarterly revenue of $3.4 billion in the third quarter and EBT adjusted of $1.2 billion, primarily as a result of high used vehicle prices contributing to gain on sale of off-lease vehicles, reduced provision expense due to stable credit performance and lower interest expense as a result of a decline in interest rates. Cruise costs were $200 million for the quarter, in line with expectations, and corp segment costs for the third quarter were $100 million, better than run rate due to the PSA revaluation and other onetime items.  We achieved our transformational cost savings target of $4 billion since 2018, including $200 million in Q3. We expect to continue making progress on the target range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion through the end of the year.  Finally, let me update you on the EBIT and cash flow scenario that we provided last quarter. Going into the second half, we anticipated U.S. light vehicle industry SAAR to be in the 14 million unit range. It has been tracking much stronger, and we are now anticipating light vehicle SAAR in the mid to high 15 million unit range in H2, with pickup truck demand specifically exceeding original expectations. We have been selling vehicles within a few days of arriving at dealerships, leading to slower inventory rebuild than anticipated. As a result, our inventory levels will likely not reach our previous scenario of 600,000 units by year-end.  We continue to carefully monitor and adjust to the macro environment, which remains volatile given the evolving pandemic that is still impacting the economy. This may adversely affect demand and production timing and levels. However, with our stronger-than-anticipated Q3 performance driven by strength in pickup trucks, full-size SUVs and crossovers and the unanticipated benefits from GM Financial due to the Brazilian credit performance and high used vehicle prices, we expect our H2 EBIT and free cash flow to be well above the scenario provided on our Q2 earnings call. Given the strong performance and assuming no unforeseen production disruptions, our updated H2 scenario for total company EBIT is in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range, with Q4 weaker than Q3 due to seasonality and free cash flow levels in H2 to be in the $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion range. I would caution against extrapolating our H2 performance going forward as we will reintroduce engineering, manufacturing and advertising costs as operations normalize.  To help you frame 2021, I would like to provide some early thoughts with our more detailed level of guidance to be provided in early February during our Q4 earnings call. At a high level, comparing 2021 to 2020 in an environment where 2020 was not impacted by the pandemic, EBIT performance expectations are fairly similar, with some puts and takes. Headwinds for 2021 compared to a normalized 2020 include increased spending as we invest in our EV rollout and potential commodity headwinds, particularly around platinum group metals. Opportunities in 2021 include an entire year of full-size SUV production, inventory build remains an opportunity but will be dependent on market demand and modest ongoing cost savings from COVID austerity learnings.  Specific to free cash flow, as mentioned previously, the permanent -- CapEx this year will lead to retimed spend in 2021. We previously communicated a CapEx run rate of $7 billion per year. As a result of this retimed 2020 spending and a strategic decision to accelerate investments in our all-electric future, we expect that our annual CapEx will exceed $7 billion through at least 2023. As Mary mentioned, we will communicate a more detailed EV strategy on November 19. In summary, our Q3 results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of the business and our ability to recover quickly from a significant disruption. We have continued our focus on launch performance, cash flow and improving the overall resilience of the business. We are laser-focused on execution and setting GM up to win in the future of mobility.  This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Congrats. Mary Barra : Thanks, Itay. Itay Michaeli : Just maybe -- John, I appreciate the color into 2021. And I was hoping we can maybe just walk through North America, the bridge there in a bit more detail. And specifically, kind of as we think about the company's earnings power in North America relative to where you thought it was pre-COVID, just maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes there just given the strength of the truck franchise this year. John Stapleton : Well, I mean what we're seeing specifically relative to the industry is actually quite stronger -- much stronger in the recent months versus what we were seeing in COVID. You can look at our bridge. I think we're calling out cost savings, excluding warranty, of about $700 million quarter-on-quarter. I think you're asking what could stick, what translates forward. I think a big chunk, Itay, of the savings really represents the austerity actions that we put in place in Q2. And where -- they bled into Q3. And as operations start to normalize as our plants continue to run hard, we will start to see some of that cost go back into the system in Q4 and beyond. Itay Michaeli : Just to clarify, John, I guess, the 2021 comparison, should we think about the 2020 as sort of on a more normalized ex COVID? And if so, could you kind of quantify what that sort of comparability should look like? John Stapleton : Sure. Yes. I mentioned that our 2021 could be in line -- more in line with pre-COVID levels, really not that indifferent than what we reviewed at Capital Markets Day back in February. We do have the puts and the takes. We mentioned plus EV spend. We mentioned potential commodity headwinds really in the platinum group metals. The tailwinds : the full year of full-size SUV and inventory build opportunity, and so potential COVID cost savings. So EBIT-wise, not that real indifferent than where we were at the Capital Markets Day.  On the cash side, a little different. Cash side, we actually delayed $2 billion of CapEx spend this year that will get retimed into next year. And as a result of our strategic decision to accelerate our investments, we will see some of this accrete into 2021 as well. Itay Michaeli : Just lastly, maybe for Mary, strategically. One of the announcements that you made throughout the quarter was the relationship with Uber to deploy EVs on rideshare networks is something we've talked about in the past. Curious if you can kind of comment on where this relationship could potentially progress over the next couple of years. Mary Barra : Well, I think you're seeing rideshare companies want to do their part from a 0 emissions perspective, and so providing the drivers the opportunity to have an EV that's within reach. And the Chevrolet Bolt EV is an excellent vehicle. We deployed it in past in the rideshare environment. And it was -- it did very well. It's very functional from that perspective. So we think it's a good offering, and we're going to continue to make that available and see how we can grow that business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : I was just hoping -- first, John, I apologize for being a little bit thick on this, but I didn't quite understand what you actually were guiding to for 2021. Did you say it would be similar to the roughly $10.5 billion EBIT that you're looking for this year, which obviously includes the gains that you're seeing in GM Financial and also COVID? Or did you sort of make adjustments to extract COVID impact from that? John Stapleton : No. I mean pre-COVID, Rod, I think at Capital Markets Day, we were guiding EPS diluted adjusted somewhere around $6.5 -- I think it was $5.75 to $6.25. And you can extrapolate that to our EBIT number. As we look forward into '21, we think we could be there. Our goal would obviously -- the puts and the takes could offset each other, but a lot is really dependent as we move forward in this uncertain world. Rod Lache : Okay. That's clear. And any color on what you're expecting for GMI ex China? Obviously, that's still a pretty significant drag. Is there a reason to be a bit optimistic about that as you look out to next year? John Stapleton : As we look to next year, it's still a difficult environment. I think everybody can see that. I think your question, is there any possible upside? I think some of the upside that we see is we'll have a full year of our Tracker, which is the SUV, we'll have a full year next year. And really, Rod, we've taken quite a bit of price this year, and that price will carry into next year, which will be a tailwind for us. I think those are the two positives that we can point to for next year in South America. Mary Barra : Yes. The only thing I would add, Rod, is also in addition to what John said, the team has just done an excellent job of continuing to take cost out of the business. So the team is very hungry to deliver positive results. And so they're committed and working day and night on that. Rod Lache : Okay. And just lastly, Mary, I mean, so much has happened here in the market over the past year competitively, especially with regard to electrification. And I was just hoping you might be able to share with us some updated thoughts on strategy and if it's evolved at all or changed at all since the March EV Day. Any thoughts about the -- accelerating the trajectory of growth in EV? Is this Oshawa expansion related to EVs or any changes to the distribution strategy? Mary Barra : So we're going to share a lot more of our EV strategy when we're at the Barclays conference later this month. But I would say we have done a lot since March -- the March EV Day, continued aggressively on the battery technology development and very pleased where we're at. From an Ultium perspective, we announced the Ultium Drive. That gives us a lot of flexibility and scale in addition to the wireless battery management system. So you can see there's a lot of work going on from a technology perspective to make sure we have leading technology. We've shared the Cadillac Lyriq and the GMC Hummer EV. Both reveals went exceptionally well, and the customer feedback from both has been very, very strong. In addition, we have announced the $2 billion investment in Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck. That will be an all-EV plant. We have the Ultium Cells LLC in Lordstown ahead of schedule, and we're hiring. And then we have the Spring Hill announcement, which is about a $2 billion investment as well. So when you step back and look at the potential that GM has from an EV perspective, we can leverage our iconic brands that have a relationship with customers across the country and, frankly, across the globe; leverage the technical capability of the team, which I'd put against any other group; the ability that we have to quickly convert our manufacturing facilities and get the scale very quickly not only from a component perspective, but in building.  So when you look at all those things, our major goal is to make sure that we are in a leading position from getting the new vehicles out. We've already talked about the fact that Ultium will give us profitable electric vehicles. And we think leading and getting vehicles across the entire market, leveraging our brands is going to be very important. Lastly, you mentioned dealers. And what I'll say, we are working in partnership with dealers. There's already been quite a bit of transformation. And we're finding that some customers want to do everything online. Other customers still want to literally kick the tires. The new systems that we're deploying, the GM-based systems that we're deploying with our dealers are helping. I also mentioned that we're leveraging systems to help dealers order the fastest-moving and often most profitable vehicles. So that's improving their business as well. So we're working in partnership with our dealers to transform and provide an excellent customer experience. The last proof point I'll give you is the GMC Hummer EV, where you look at with 4 steps being able to make a deposit on a vehicle and improve pricing transparency so customers know exactly what they're going to pay, no incentives, no discounting, no haggling. And this is all being done in partnership with our dealers. So there's a lot more to come here, and I'm very pleased with the great work that we're doing together. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : One more question on the EV strategy. I really appreciate all the color today. So today, NIO's market gap has officially surpassed GM's. And that's the latest example of high market valuations and cheap access to capital for this electric vehicle company. I was hoping to get your latest thoughts on what the best way is to unlock shareholder value from your technology. Last quarter, you said nothing is off the table, but I'm certainly getting a strong vibe from all the announcements on the EV side that things seem to be being kept all together. So just your latest thoughts what's the best way to unlock shareholder value. Mary Barra : Well, Emmanuel, as I've always said, we're committed to and have taken many steps in our EV business as well as our autonomous business to maximize the ability to unlock long-term shareholder value, not something that's going to necessarily cause a quick pop. When you look at all of the assets that we bring to that and recognize that EV is a propulsion system, there's many other parts of the vehicle, we're focused on speed and what's going to drive the business and growth over the long term. So we'll talk more about it at the Barclays conference. But our focus is absolutely on unlocking shareholder value and speed to market. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And then a second question, could you talk a little bit more about the benefits from the alliance with Honda in North America? I'm just curious if you could maybe detail a time line, magnitude of expected benefits, what sort of product lines are even being considered, just anything that helps us understand the opportunity here. Mary Barra : Sure. As we mentioned in September, we announced a nonbinding MOU. We continue to have discussions, are making great progress on a definitive agreement. And the scope of things that we're working on are platform sharing, sharing with R&D, connectivity solutions as well as purchasing. So -- and if you think about the items that I've just mentioned, those are -- can lead to significant cost savings. So we'll have more to outline as we get to a definitive agreement, but it's a pretty broad look at what we can do together to make us both more efficient and also make -- allow for leading technology and EVs and platforms in the market. Emmanuel Rosner : And just timing-wise, any sense when the earliest benefits could be realized? Mary Barra : I think probably need to let us get the definitive agreement before I start quantifying and timing them, Emmanuel, if that's okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to look at Slide 17 in the supplemental portion of the deck and look at this and -- I mean maybe recognize -- I mean I've got data going back more than 30 years. $4.4 billion EBIT for North America is a record and a pretty strong one. And you can certainly argue there's some puts and takes and benefits at the current time, but it's not necessarily the greatest time in the world in North America. So it's pretty impressive, right? I mean I don't think this should be undersold.  I'm just curious, as you're looking at this, I mean, John, you mentioned that some of the cost savings may not repeat. But I think you guys indicated that you're going to get $200 million -- or you got $200 million of the $4 billion goal to wrap that up. And you're going for $4.5 billion now. But let's take out $800 million there and say maybe that's not going to repeat and maybe knock out the price and say, \"Hey, listen, the market is just so insanely hot that might not repeat.\" You're still doing well north of a 10% EBIT margin.  So I'm just curious if that logic makes sense to you and why, given the strategy and the product that you might not be able to hold on to some of that price and some of that cost go forward. Because I mean you're being very humble and underselling what you did in North America. John Stapleton : I guess, John, I guess a couple of comments there. As we look forward -- we've worked hard on the $4 billion to $4.5 billion. We're looking hard at what can we make stick from an austerity perspective. We do have some tailwinds with the all-new full-size SUVs, 3 brands, we've got some strength there.  If you look at the last handful of years, we've been in launch mode, really, launching our T1 platform, the Silverado, Sierra and the SUVs. And now we're -- we've got the launch behind us. And so going forward, yes, I mean, we're going to utilize some of that strength. And I think we've talked about North America 10% margins. We've demonstrated in the last 5 years we can do 10% in most years and even some quarters better than 10%.  Some of that, though, will actually have to use to pay some of the acceleration of our EVs on a go-forward basis. And I think Mary mentioned we're going to go hard at this and more to come at Barclays in the middle of the month. Mary Barra : But I think it's a really good point, John, that our North America business, especially the strength of our full-size truck platform and the franchise there, full-size SUVs, gives us excellent opportunity to self-fund our growth in EVs and then leverage all the assets we bring, whether it's manufacturing, engineering, technology.  So I think we have to focus in on what it takes to really put vehicles on the road that are long-term durable and high quality, also that customers want. And I think, frankly, that's been a little bit underappreciated. But when you look at the earnings potential, even with the adjustments that you made in North America, we're going to go hard at EVs and demonstrate the assets that we're going to bring to it. And the North America performance that John is being a bit modest about allows us to do that. John Murphy : Okay. That's helpful. I still think you're being awful humble there, but we'll be -- just a second question on EVs, and I understand you're going to talk about it more in the coming days. But you've made certainly comments about doing Ultium powertrain inside and you've discussed cycle times being shorter. So I just wonder if you could sort of clarify on the EV Ultium strategy whether levels of outsourcing or in-sourcing may be similar or different versus ICE vehicles have been historically. And then also, Mary, I mean, in the press release, you did talk about cycle times being faster, so that should be fair game on this call. What does the faster cycle times mean -- product cycle times mean on EVs? Mary Barra : So I think a couple of points, and I'm really glad that you asked the question. So we have -- from an Ultium perspective, we have a very robust road map of how we're going to work to take costs out and really leverage the scale and the opportunity that we have when you think about the market size that we have in North America as well as China. And there's other markets that are open for us. So I think there's a huge opportunity for EV growth in our business. And as we mentioned, I think what you're referring to on cycle times is the fact that the GMC Hummer EV is the fastest vehicle development we've ever put on the road. We're using new technology and tools. The fact that the way the Ultium platform has been designed, it's very modular. So that allows for reuse of engineering. That speeds up the process. The design team with how the Ultium platform -- when you're not trying to retrofit an ICE platform but you start with an EV-intended platform, that gives you a lot of design freedom and flexibility. You're seeing that with the LYRIQ and with the GMC Hummer, and there's more to come.  So all of those things are allowing us to have a much faster global vehicle development process to get the vehicles on the road. And so we'll share more about that, but that -- those are all the elements that are allowing us to do that.  And again, the milestones we've established and the speed at which we plan taking cost out from the battery -- because cost on EVs is all about the battery. And so getting those costs down, controlling what we need to control, and I think you've seen are a definite change at General Motors of how we did ICE vehicles versus the way we're doing EVs with controlling and having the JV on cell manufacture. So we're rethinking every aspect of the business to make sure that it's going to allow us speed, it's going to allow us to have a cost base that allows us to enter many more segments with profitable EVs into the marketplace, which I think then that represents the growth opportunity in front of us. John Murphy : Could this mean that mid-cycle majors are a thing of the past? Mary Barra : Well, I think we have to look at that, that it will be customer-driven. Because I think if you step back and you go 5, 6 years ago, mid-cycle enhancements are all about the exterior. And now not only do you have changes you can make to the exterior possibly faster, but also what you can do internally. And with our vehicle intelligence platform and the ability to do over-the-air updates, whether it's something new that you're going to put out on a model or something that you can upgrade in a previous model to, that's all new business for us in the services side of it. So don't underestimate the fact that I think John said we're going to have VIP on about 33 vehicles, was it, John, by 2023. And of course, that will be driving our EV vehicles as well. John Murphy : Just on the dividends from China and GMF, John, what are the -- I mean I think it's -- year-to-date China's 500 and GMF is 800. What do we have left just to top out the year? And then I'm done. John Stapleton : Yes, nothing left on GMF, and the 500 remaining at -- from China will be in Q4. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : I want to go back to the electrification question. I mean you've clearly shown you've done a great job managing through the past year plus, I guess, with the strike and the pandemic. You showed the resilience. We've seen the return to solid cash flow. And I know, historically, that's been a big part of your goal and investment thesis, improving that conversion. But you're also clearly talking about here accelerating investment in electrification. So given what's going on in the industry and the capital markets, I think you could probably build the case that it's better for you to not theorize robust free cash flow as maybe you were sort of talking about a year or so ago. And I wanted to get your thoughts on that. And it sounds like, with these accelerated EV investments, maybe you could just help us a little bit about how we should think about the return on that. You talked about improved speed to market, but does this actually mean you can pull forward bringing some of that product to market faster than initially thought? Mary Barra : Absolutely. We will definitely be bringing EVs to market faster than what the plan was a year ago. We've learned a lot in the last year. And the speed at which we're developing the Lyriq and the Hummer, I think, are evidence of that. And so we definitely will have vehicles in market more quickly with our new strategy. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then just a second one. So the HUMMER EV looks great. And I know you indicate this is going to be profitable, but it's also certainly an expensive vehicle. And if we look at Tesla's plan, one of their tenets is really was to use expensive vehicles to lower the cost of technology, broaden the addressable market. And again, I mean to be fair, right, the initial Model S is in that sort of -- $100,000 vehicles for them as well.  So I guess the question for you is, between the Hummer and the Lyriq and the Cadillac product, those are also expensive vehicles, is the plan similar? Like I know you've got the Bolt EUV. But beyond that, how do you think about leveraging the high end and the technology to move towards higher-volume passenger cars? Or do you really want to stay within your sort of core segments of trucks and maybe some luxury? Mary Barra : So the trajectory that we have for the Ultium battery technology is going to allow us in this initial rollout of Ultium to have vehicles in the high-volume segments. So we definitely plan on -- when you think about our brands, where Chevy plays in the heart of the market in value, we will have entries across our brands and across segments and into affordable high-volume segments. Joseph Spak : Okay. That's very clear. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Just a couple of quick questions. The first is on Ultium LLC. You're really rapidly developing the capabilities of this business at a time when there is -- seems to be a scarcity of those skateboards in that kind of -- those -- that module, that system with so many entrants, whether they're legacy entrants or all-new entrants that want to get in. And so obviously, I think that the core business of Ultium is to help GM time to market and flexibility, but also presents an interesting third-party opportunity.  Now in addition to Honda, which you've disclosed as a potential customer, if you will, can you tell us the state of any other discussions of third-party supply from Ultium to other manufacturers? Are there discussions going on? Even if you can't be specific, are such discussions going on at this point? Mary Barra : So Adam, one is the Honda isn't a possibility. It's already a done deal that Honda will be leveraging our Ultium platform for two vehicles. So -- and there's just more opportunity as we work with them. I don't have anything specific to share right now on others, but I would just tell you there are other conversations underway. Adam Jonas : Okay. Appreciate that, Mary. And just as a follow-up on cash return. Now if we think life pre-COVID, the strategy -- and you've laid it out very clearly in the past : invest in the business; fortress balance sheet; profitable growth; and then what's left, return to shareholders. Pre-COVID, you guys returned on order of $20 billion through share buybacks, right? That was money you took out of the business and your investors are wanting you to do it, and you did what they wanted and you gave it back instead of investing in the business. . Am I right in thinking that post-COVID, the world really has changed? And while you still reserve the right to define what excess cash is, but given the growth opportunity ahead and managing this with perhaps even greater emphasis on fortress balance sheet post-COVID, am I thinking that while you may still give us those -- that sequence or that waterfall of what's left, that this is not a cash return story anymore as much as it used to be and is much more a growth story? Is that just conceptually the right emphasis here? Mary Barra : Adam, I think we're going to still follow our capital allocation strategy, which means reinvest in the business to generate appropriate returns, a blended return on invested capital of 20%. We're going to maintain an investor-grade balance sheet. And then the third pillar, as you suggest, was returning to shareholders. I think what you hear us saying is we do believe that there are a number of very important programs and services that we can deploy that are going to lead to growth of General Motors. I can't talk about the rest of the world, but we see a huge growth opportunity for General Motors. That's why we're accelerating EVs, putting the focus on services with the addition of Alan Wexler joining the organization. And so we see a growth opportunity that focus on that first pillar.  We'll still maintain it because we want to do the right thing for all of our investors. But we will be heavily focused on the growth opportunity, and that's facilitated by the first pillar. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Congrats on the quarter. Maybe starting with a follow-up on the GMNA profitability questions earlier. Are you able to sort of parse out how much of the $1.0 billion of year-over-year contribution from lower cost in 3Q, as shown on Slide 17, is related to more temporal factors such as austerity-related cost savings that might reverse versus how much stems from savings that are more structural in nature?  And how should we think about the cost line specifically tracking in GMNA going forward as austerity savings normalize but structural savings continue?  And I think you might also combine in this driver the higher cost of the content on new launches, such as the SUVs, which you've suggested before might need to be netted against pricing. So any sort of disaggregation that you might be able to provide with regard to all of the different factors in 3Q that went into the cost driver for GMNA would be very helpful. Mary Barra : So the way I would look at it, Ryan, is clearly, there were austerity measures that are more related to the pandemic. And as the business resumes manufacturing, et cetera, there will be costs that we incur.  There will be savings as well as we demonstrated through the transformation. But what you also hear us saying is we're going to accelerate EV. So some of that savings will go against that. Significantly improving the rollout of EV is going to take both engineering and capital. So I think as you look forward and try to map into '21, you have to factor in, yes, we've made permanent savings in the way we do business, but we're now accelerating other parts of the business. And some of that savings will fund that.  Some of the austerity will stick, and we'll provide more clarity around that when we get to talking about '21 in the February time frame when we roll out fourth quarter earnings. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. And then lastly, I think I heard John say that you expect a mid to high 15 million range of U.S. light vehicle SAAR in the back half of the year. Looking at July through October, I think it's running at about 15.6 million so far and the last couple of months at 16.4 million.  So just curious if you're seeing or anticipating any kind of a slowdown here in November and December or perhaps are just being cautious. I think your guidance, which is based on wholesale, is derisked relative to the near-term trend in sales, just given your ability to replenish inventories going forward. But still, I'd be curious to know how you're feeling about the market, if you think it's likely to continue to hold strong like in September and October in the 16s or if you're concerned about, I don't know, any sort of risks around uncertainty due to the election or higher COVID cases or something else. John Stapleton : No. I mean we didn't really bake COVID uncertainty, if you will, into our SAAR projection. What we are seeing, though, on the retail side, in particular, very, very strong. If you look at the retail SAAR for H2, it's virtually in line with last year. Last year, in total, we had 17.5 million units. So the actual reduction, if you will, in the second half of the year relates more toward fleet, daily rental companies. Fleet customers have dialed back a bit. But we see -- barring a major event in COVID, we do see continued strong retail SAAR in the second half and into Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Obviously we'll have a chance in a couple of weeks to talk about the EV strategy, and appreciate the advertising for it. But I do want to ask when people think about the leading EV company, it's not just the EV propulsion system, it's the digital cockpit, vehicle update capability, the frequent kind of mid-cycle refreshes, if you will, that's delivered by software updates. So can you give us a sense and also you mentioned Alan Wexler, the kind of digital transformation outside of EV propulsion that we could expect to see either in the electric vehicles themselves or, frankly, in a broader lineup to keep them fresh and relevant for modern buyers? Mary Barra : Yes. Brian, your line has got a lot of static on it. So I think I got the question. And you're talking about the digital transformation. We do view the vehicle as a digital platform. We have -- over the last 5 years or so, we have in-sourced virtually all of the software inside. That gives us the opportunity to have much better control, much better integration and speed to put new offerings. So we see a definite opportunity with over-the-air, not just for EVs, but for all of our vehicles, ICE vehicles as well, to leverage the service opportunity and build on what we have with OnStar with the number of vehicles that we have connected already. So I say that, that is a huge growth opportunity as well in both EV and ICE. Brian Johnson : Okay. And in terms of when those types of products could be seen in the showroom on non-EVs, when would we sort of see a [indiscernible] different cockpit, much more connected, showing up in showrooms? Mary Barra : Well, I mean I think if you look at the Cadillac Escalade right now, you see a -- that -- there's already 9 vehicles that have our vehicle intelligence platform in it, and that's growing. And that provides us the foundation just to build on that. So I think it will continue to grow the number of vehicles that we have with that capability. And then the services, we -- like I said, we have a team that's working on that right now as well. So as we have 30 vehicles by 2023 that have the VIP, with more following as quickly as we can, that's going to give us the opportunity to seize the service piece of it and leverage the digital platform. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Dan Levy : I just wanted to start first on the commentary on the dealer stock. So you're not going to get to 600,000, I think, which is well understood. But the question is, like, you need to continue rebuilding your inventory into 2021. We've now seen a couple of months of SAAR north of 16 million, which basically normalized. And in the 2018/'19 period, you were running at roughly 800,000 units of gross stock on a monthly basis. Is that 800,000 a reasonable target that we should expect you to rebuild toward? Or are you going to try to play it maybe a little more conservatively? John Stapleton : I think that we'll -- I think that was a very high number. We were coming off of launches, and we wanted to build a little bit of inventory as we walked into the second half of last year. I think what we're seeing now with this focused ordering approach with our dealers -- and dealers are learning to operate at much lower inventory levels. They're taking cost out. That allows us to take cost out. I don't see the 800,000 to transfer into the future. We do see a lower number. Dan Levy : Okay. So we should consider just going forward, you're going to be a little -- you're going to aim to be a little more lean on the dealer stock levels. Okay. And then a follow-up. Mary, maybe you can help us understand on the Honda MOU. I know you said TBD on the timing, but could you maybe just contextualize what's your current spend is on combustion platforms? How significant the portion of the budget it is? And how much of that can be shared with Honda? Just trying to get a sense for the magnitude of product or content you have that's maybe less value-add or a little more commoditized, which people aren't giving you as much credit for, but that can be shared with Honda and that can -- allows you to reinvest that amount into EV. Mary Barra : Yes. Well, first of all, I think it's also important to note with Honda, we're also already sharing EV platforms. So it's hard to quantify that. I will tell you that we are -- much of our capital and engineering is now over-indexing into EVs. And as I mentioned, we already have sharing going on with Honda on that.  But I think your point of -- for being flexible with how quickly the EV transformation will happen and having the right products from an ICE perspective as well as an EV perspective, joining with Honda on those key platforms that may continue for a while allows us to do that much more efficiently. I mean it cuts it in half virtually for the core and then we each do our top hits that we go to market with a very different offering. So there is tremendous savings there. It's hard for me to quantify that because it changes year-to-year based on what programs we're engineering and launching.  But I will tell you -- so I would just say there's significant cost savings available. It will be as we commonize platforms, we have already started to do that from an EV perspective. So there's potential further opportunity there, and it just makes us more efficient. Dan Levy : And is it possible to bring other automakers into the fold on the combustion sharing side? Mary Barra : I would say anything is possible. We have to look for what makes the most sense and how, I'll say, new program schedules align. But we're opening to look for ways to drive efficiency across the industry. We're very open to that. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Yes. I was hoping to ask more on Cruise and the news about getting the approval to do testing with no drivers in San Francisco. Maybe you can help us better understand what are the key factors that are needed from here in order to get to commercial deployments. Is it just a matter of time and seeing how these driverless vehicles are performing and that gives you enough confidence as you get more data to be able to deploy? Or do you think there's further technical or regulatory hurdles that will need to be cleared in order to get to commercial deployment? Mary Barra : Well, if you look at commercialization, we're going to continue our development and testing work that we're already engaged in and then the discussions with regulators to ensure that both from a technology and a regulatory perspective we're in a position to operate commercially.  When you think about what we've announced with what we're going to do yet this year in San Francisco with the testing without a safety driver in the vehicle, I think that that's just another level of milestones that we need to achieve. And then -- and we'll be the first doing it in a complex urban environment. And why that's so important is, if you think about even today's ride-sharing, the opportunity for profitability is in dense urban environments. And so being able to deploy the technology there instead of in a suburban environment, I think, gives us a faster pathway to commercialization and profitability. And the vehicle capability will only continue, and that means then the area, the geofence area that the vehicle can -- vehicles can operate in grows as well. So both will go together. Mark Delaney : Okay. That's helpful. And then a question on cash flow. Kind of within that scenario, the company was discussing a relatively flattish SAAR on a sequential basis going forward. What would that imply for working capital as either a headwind or a tailwind for 4Q and perhaps into 2021 as well? John Stapleton : Yes. For Q2, we burned $9 billion, so we had a huge unwind. Q3, it was almost dollar-for-dollar rewind. We generated $9.1 billion of free cash flow. As we look forward, Q4 and beyond, we're really more toward the normalized levels now, not as big or hardly any impact on a managed working capital. It's already happened in Q3. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Well, thanks, everyone. I really appreciate everybody's interest, especially in our EV transformation. But to sum up the quarter, it was a very strong quarter. Very proud of the team for the great results that were delivered. And I think it demonstrates that we're fully maximizing our strong new vehicle portfolio both in crossovers, full-size trucks and full-size SUV, obviously being helped by a recovering market. We also greatly accelerated our EV and our AV progress. We've talked a lot about that this morning, and we have more to announce very soon. And it does, I think, start to outline a very significant growth opportunity for General Motors. Overall, the team has worked very hard to build an agile and resilient business. I think we've demonstrated that over the second and the third quarter. We are committed to not only continuing to run a strong business with all of our franchise, but also focus on growth opportunities that will create long-term value for our shareholders. So I want to thank everybody again for participating. And please stay safe, stay healthy, wear your mask. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for joining.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, February 10, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Tabitha. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2020. Our press results were issued this morning and the conference call materials are available on GM Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast.  I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial. It's my pleasure to welcome Paul to his first earnings call with us today and give Paul a chance to talk about his enthusiasm for our shared vision and accelerating our path forward. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rocky, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining. This morning, we shared the details of our strong 2020 financial performance, including Q4 records for EBIT-adjusted, EBIT-adjusted margin, EPS diluted adjusted, and a record year for GM Financial. These results were driven by the quick actions we took to recover from the early effects of the pandemic.  Looking at the past year, our employees, suppliers, and dealers rallied with speed and agility to support our customers and our communities as well as protecting the business. The pandemic has been a catalyst for finding new and better ways to work while strengthening our resolve to win. As some of our plants suspended production in the early days, our teams rapidly turned to producing critical care ventilators and personal protective equipment for patients and frontline health care workers. After our first conversation with Ventec Life Systems, we began production in just 30 days and we built 30,000 ventilators in 154 days. And with that same speed, we developed rigorous safety protocols so we could restart our operations around the globe. This collective spirit was inspiring, and it still drives us and it's contributing to the greatest era of transformation in the history of our company.  In spite of the pandemic, we accelerated mission-critical businesses like our EV and AV initiative. We maximized production of full-size trucks, and we launched our new family of full-size SUVs safely and on time. We'll sustain this culture of innovation and leadership in 2021 and beyond, and that is my focus this morning.  We are fully committed to a capital allocation strategy that invests in new and existing businesses to drive growth. We're going to generate that growth through our EV portfolio as well as businesses like BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance Services, subscription services like Super Cruise and OnStar Guardian and much more to come from our growth and innovation team. The semiconductor shortage won't slow our growth plans, and with our mitigation strategies, we still expect a very good year for General Motors, and Paul will share additional details in his remarks.  We have strong underlying performance and very strong momentum with customers. Last year, for example, we posted our largest year-over-year U.S. market share gain since 1990 led by full-size trucks and SUVs. In 2020, GM was the full-size pickup sales leader in the United States, thanks to gains by the Chevrolet Silverado and record GMC Sierra deliveries, and we plan to expand our capacity in early 2022. The new Cadillac Escalade, GMC Yukon, and Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban are leading the full-size SUV market. And GM China rode the increasing market preference for large MPVs and luxury vehicles to year-over-year sales increases in these segments, including record deliveries for Cadillac. And as we look to the future, we are well positioned from a policy standpoint. I personally and members of our senior leadership team have had discussions with President Biden, Vice President Harris, and several key cabinet appointees. The Biden administration is increasingly aligned around the importance of domestic manufacturing and the need for widespread adoption of EVs. We look forward to working with the administration on policies that support safer transportation with zero emissions.  When you look at the strategy we have shared, it should be clear. We will seize every opportunity to drive growth, expand our markets, and enter new ones. Our Ultium platform is core to these initiatives. It is the foundation for our upcoming global family of EVs. With our first-generation Ultium platform, we will now see a 40% battery cost reduction compared to today's Chevrolet Bolt EV. And we're already working on the next-generation of Ultium battery technology, which will deliver a 60% improvement over Bolt EV with double the energy density. To do this work, we've hired almost half of the 3,000 expected new tech employees across engineering, design and IT, and we expect to finish hiring by the end of the quarter.  What is especially exciting to me is that our vision and our commitments and our aspirations are attracting incredibly talented people to GM. They believe in what we are doing, and when they arrive, they are finding like-minded colleagues already hard at work. Since we first introduced our growth strategy and related announcements in November, we have shared even more of the aggressive steps we are taking to accelerate our plan. We have committed to increasing our EV and AV investments to $27 billion from 2020 through 2025, including more than $7 billion this year alone. With this investment, we will launch 30 EVs globally and achieve EV market leadership in North America. In addition, by mid-decade, we plan to sell at least 1 million EVs per year in our 2 largest markets in North America and with our joint venture partners in China.  During CES in January, we revealed a new GM brand identity that honors our past but signals our future. We also introduced a new safety brand, Periscope. It describes how we will advance toward a world with zero crashes by integrating vehicle technology, research, and advocacy. And we launched a new brand campaign called Everybody In, which is our call to action to get everyone in an EV. Everybody In is a powerful idea because we must all be all in to achieve our goals. We'll offer EVs across all of our brands and at price points and span the global EV market from the Wuling Hong Guang Mini to the Cadillac CELESTIQ. As for the GMC Hummer EV, we have prototypes on the road right now, and they are undergoing cold weather testing in Michigan's upper peninsula, then they will head to Yuma, Arizona into the toughest off-road trails in Moab, Utah. In the meantime, VIN 001 is already spoken for. As part of GMC's partnership with the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, the first GMC Hummer EV will be auctioned on March 27. All proceeds will go to assisting the families of fallen and disabled soldiers and first responders.  We envision a future where there is an EV offering for everyone. Our future will be inclusive and comprehensive, and it will create new businesses, and in some cases new brands. BrightDrop is a powerful example. It is a new commercial EV business that targets delivery and logistics providers, particularly those in the parcel and food delivery industries with innovative zero emission solutions. From a revenue standpoint, we'll provide vehicles like an EV600 van, which is a substantial opportunity in and of itself because the global market for light commercial vehicles is almost 9 million units today according to IHS Markit.  And we believe demand for electric light commercial vehicles will grow quickly. The market seems to agree. In fact, third-party research estimates that the addressable market for eLCVs could be $30 billion by 2025 and double that in 2030. BrightDrop also allows us to create new sources of value for our customers beyond the vehicle, driving diverse income streams from a full ecosystem of product and services. FedEx Express is slated to receive the first EV600 later this year. The EV600s will help them meet their stated fuel efficiency goals as part of their broader sustainability strategy and electrification efforts. FedEx Express has also conducted a pilot with the BrightDrop EP1 electric pallet product and has another 1 planned. In this first pilot, the EP1 demonstrated significant productivity increases in the delivery process. Similarly, Merchants Fleet, which has more than 150,000 vehicles under management, is targeting to have 50% of its mobile fleet electric by 2025 and 50% of its managed clients' fleet by 2030 and is moving forward with plans to put 12,600 BrightDrop EV600s into service.  Another exciting and potentially lucrative source of growth is our Hydrotec fuel cell technology. Like BrightDrop, Hydrotec is proof that General Motors' vision of a world with 0 emissions isn't limited to passenger vehicles. Less than 2 weeks ago, Navistar, GM and OneH2 announced a zero-emission long-haul transportation ecosystem that will launch in 2024. Navistar will begin building Class 8 trucks for its launch customers, GM will supply Hydrotec fuel cells and OneH2 will supply the hydrogen fueling infrastructure. It's an exciting way for us to partner in the Class 8 segment, a nearly $30 billion market in the U.S. alone and that one that we haven't seen before. And we believe this is just the beginning for Hydrotec. This is a nascent multibillion-dollar hydrogen power industry for trucking, for military, aerospace and stationary power applications that we are targeting directly as well as through GM Defense. Customers and shareholders will continue to see even more evidence throughout 2021 that we're executing our vision and plans for growth. One great example is right around the corner. On Sunday, GM will unveil the 2022 Bolt EUV, which arrives this summer and will be built in Orion, Michigan. The all-new Bolt EUV and refreshed Bolt EV feature unique exterior designs and new interiors. The Bolt EUV will provide nearly 3 inches more legroom than the Bolt EV and will have available wireless phone charging and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, allowing customers to easily access their music and podcasts.  Like the original Bolt EV, the new Bolt EUV and refreshed Bolt EV will build on Chevy's commitment to attainable EVs. The Chevrolet Bolt EUV is the first Chevrolet and the first GM EV to offer Super Cruise technology, 1 of the 22 GM vehicles that will offer Super Cruise by 2023. Based on feedback from Cadillac customers, we're confident that we will build a steady stream of subscription revenue because our customers don't want to drive without it. In addition, GM, Cruise and Microsoft will increasingly leverage Azure, Microsoft's cloud and edge computing platform, to help commercialize self-driving vehicles at scale. And with new investment by GM, Microsoft, Honda and other institutional investors, the estimated valuation of Cruise now stands at $30 billion. And just yesterday, the California DMV released the 2020 disengagement data for autonomous vehicles, and we are very pleased with the excellent continuing improvement and leadership shown by Cruise. This fall, we'll begin building the GMC Hummer EV at our Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck. Work on our flagship EV plant is on track, and we cannot wait to start shipping vehicles to customers. Among its many advanced manufacturing capabilities, Factory ZERO will be the first U.S. auto plant equipped with 5G fixed mobile network technology. As we said in November, our $27 billion in EV and AV investments will include additional EV assembly and battery capability beyond what we've announced for Factory ZERO, Spring Hill in Tennessee and our LTM cells JV plant in Ohio, where hiring is already underway. In fact, employees will build prototypes later this year. Along the way, OnStar Insurance Services is on target to expand to all 50 states by the end of the year.  What's happening inside our company and behind the scenes is also important to our success. Delivering this exciting new chapter for GM requires a special team that values diversity and inclusion, a safe workplace and the commitment to create a better, safer and more sustainable world. We aspire to be the most inclusive company in the world because it's the right thing to do and because diversity and inclusion are the foundation of a winning culture. I am deeply and personally engaged in this part of our strategy. Our strong values are a compelling tailwind for GM. They will drive creativity, agility and so much more for our future. This future also inspires us to do even more to help mitigate the efforts of climate change, and we will. Less than 2 weeks ago, we announced plans to become carbon-neutral in our global products and operations by 2040. We will set science-based targets to achieve carbon neutrality, and we aspire to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles globally by 2035.  We will source 100% renewable energy to power our global sites by 2035, 5 years earlier than we announced just a year ago. And we have signed the Business Ambition Pledge for 1.5-degree Celsius, a call to action from a global coalition of UN agencies, business and industry leaders. Like everything else we do, we will provide updates on our progress, and we will hold ourselves accountable. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the results, I want to take a quick minute to thank Mary, the broader executive team and really the entire organization for the warm welcome that I've received in my time so far here at GM. I'm really excited for the opportunities that we have ahead of us as we build appreciation for the innovation that we are championing right now. Whether it's in EV, AV, connected services or our overarching vision of zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion. We are executing well on our growth strategy and accelerating these growth opportunities with an emphasis on investing in new businesses while maintaining a strong investment-grade balance sheet. We believe we can take advantage of these once-in-a-generation opportunities to achieve strong profitable growth with a solid return on investment.  Being a part of GM as it writes the next chapters of its history is a huge honor for me. I look forward to continuing the conversations I've had with the investment community thus far and getting to know those of you I have not yet had the chance to meet.  Now let's get into the results. While 2020 was adversely impacted by production challenges experienced in the first half of the year, we demonstrated resilience and flexibility as we quickly moved to preserve liquidity and manage inventory while still launching an all-new lineup of our highly profitable full-size SUVs and prioritizing investments in our all-electric future. Even in the face of the pandemic, we generated results of $122.5 billion in net revenue, $9.7 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 7.9% margins, $4.90 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow in 2020.  In the fourth quarter, we continued to see strength in demand as we generated $3.7 billion in EBIT-adjusted, including the $1.1 billion charge for Takata. We far exceeded the top end of the scenario shared on our Q3 earnings call, absent the impact of Takata due to strong performance in North America and GM Financial, in particular. We also drove strong Q4 net revenue of $37.5 billion, approximately 10% EBIT-adjusted margins and $1.93 in EPS diluted adjusted and $3.4 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow.  The Q4 $1.93 EPS diluted adjusted includes a negative impact of $0.59 from the Takata airbag-inflator recall and a $0.26 gain from investments in PSA and Lordstown Motor Corporation. In Q4, we fully repaid the remaining balance on our corporate revolver draw and ended the year with strong automotive cash balance of $22.3 billion and total automotive liquidity of more than $40 billion.  Let's take a closer look at North America. In the calendar year, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $9.1 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and a 9.4% margin. In Q4, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.6 billion, up $2.3 billion year-over-year as we moved past the effect of the 2019 strike. Continued performance from the launch of our all-new full-size SUVs and disciplined pricing on our full-size pickup trucks offset the impact of the Takata recall. U.S. retail sales have continued to recover, with Q4 GM results up 12% year-over-year despite limited inventories, closing the year strong with December retail sales up over 19% year-over-year. We have seen this strong performance continue into January, with sales up 9% year-over-year. Additionally, U.S. retail market share gains have been solid, up 1.4 percentage points year-over-year in Q4, exceeding 18% market share, driven by the newly launched full-size SUVs and high demand for large pickup trucks. And we are looking forward to retail EV growth, where we are seeing encouraging signs for demand. We're really excited about the launch of the GMC Hummer EV this fall. When we revealed that in Q4, it was the most watched auto reveal in history with 1.3 billion impressions and 370 million views. And it created the highest website traffic of any GM model ever. We wanted to kick off GM's acceleration towards EVs with something as exciting as the GMC Hummer EV, a vehicle that we are very proud of. And it's just the beginning as we roll out 30 new EVs globally by 2025, with several high volume entries in North America by 2023. Let's move to GM International. Full year EBIT-adjusted in GMI was a loss of $500 million, down $300 million year-over-year due to the effects of the pandemic on operations, particularly in China, partially offset by performance improvement outside of China. For the fourth quarter, we were encouraged by our progress with EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, up $400 million year-over-year due to positive price/mix and benefits from our cost actions, partially offset by weaker FX in South America.  We delivered $500 million of equity income in China for the calendar year, including $200 million in Q4, in line with our expectations. As we progress through the year following Q1 lows, we saw market recovery and benefits from our launches and cost actions, returning to the approximately $200 million quarterly equity income run rate in Q2 through Q4. We received $500 million in dividends from our China automotive JVs in Q4, bringing total dividends to $1 billion for the year.  Just a few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment before we turn to 2021. GM Financial posted revenue of $13.8 billion for the year and record EBT-adjusted of $2.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, GM Financial generated revenue of $3.4 billion and EBT-adjusted of $1 billion, a Q4 record, up $500 million year-over-year due to strong used vehicle prices, contributing to gains on sale of off-leased vehicles, improved credit performance and lower interest expense due to declining interest rates. Cruise costs for the year and in the quarter were $900 million and $300 million, respectively. 2020 was a huge year for Cruise. After substantial development and testing, Cruise has now reached the point where it has removed the human driver from behind the wheel and is now fully testing driverless cars on the streets of San Francisco successfully, as Mary noted earlier. We expect many more good things to come for Cruise in 2021. Cruise segment spend is projected to be about $1 billion in '21. Corp segment costs were $600 million for the year and better in the fourth quarter than the normal run rate of $1 billion due to investment gains. We expect the underlying spend in the Corp segment to be about $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase over our normal run rate as we are accounting for certain growth initiatives in the Corp segment.  In late 2018, we made a strategic decision to accelerate our transformation for the future to strengthen our core business, capitalize on the future of personal mobility and drive significant cost efficiencies. Our plan included a path to achieve $4 billion to $4.5 billion in cost savings through 2020. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved $4.5 billion in savings since 2018, including $200 million in Q4 and inclusive of $200 million of savings related to the wind-down of Holden and sale of our Thailand business. Having the right cost structure that aligns with our strategy is a key focus for us. We've made great progress with the actions taken over the past several years, and we will continue to pursue incremental efficiencies.  Now let's turn to the 2021 outlook for the calendar year. As we enter 2021, we see ongoing industry recovery and strong demand for our most profitable products. The underlying business has never been more robust. I want to provide some macro context around 2021 to help set the stage. With continued recovery of the U.S. light vehicle industry in '21, we expect SAAR to be in the mid-16 million unit range, with a stronger second half as we experience normal seasonality in Q1 and expect to see an inflection point in the spring as vaccination rates increase and warmer weather lifts consumer sentiment and auto demand.  In China, we expect the industry to grow year-over-year as the economy continues to recover. However, we expect a continued competitive pricing environment with increased environmental compliance costs. In South America, we expect continued commercial and portfolio strength to more than offset the macro headwinds. Finally, we expect commodity prices to be a significant headwind as platinum group metals and steel prices have seen major increases in recent weeks and months.  Our underlying 2021 performance is expected to be strong, including EBIT-adjusted in the $10 billion to $11 billion range as the fundamental business is robust, and we will offset significant commodity headwinds while increasing investments to support our growth strategy and EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $4.50 to $5.25.  As Mary mentioned at the outset of this call, the industry-wide semiconductor supply shortage will also impact us this year, as it does many other industries. Included in the guidance I just provided is an estimated $1.5 billion to $2 billion in EBIT-adjusted full year impact driven by loss contribution margin, partially offset by mitigation efforts through cost and go-to-market actions. We expect the shortage to be temporary, and we'll look to focus on protecting supply of our highest demand products such as full-size trucks and SUVs as well as EVs.  Importantly, we do not believe this short-term headwind will affect our long-term earnings power, and we remain committed to our growth initiatives and the EV acceleration we have previously communicated. From an adjusted automotive free cash flow perspective, we estimate a 2021 impact from the semiconductor shortage in the $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion range, putting 2021 adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the range of $1 billion to $2 billion.  We announced the extension of downtime at Fairfax, CAMI and San Luis Potosi yesterday, which is included in our numbers above. Our intent is to make up as much production lost at these plants in the second half of the year as possible. We expect 2021 CapEx to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range, which includes approximately $2 billion of deferred CapEx from 2020 as well as accelerated investments in our all-electric future.  Also included in our guidance is cash outflow from the Takata recall, which we expect to occur over the next 2 to 3 years from the expense we took in fourth quarter. Nonoperating items included in our guidance worth mentioning include higher year-over-year net interest expense and an expected tax rate of approximately 24%, which is higher primarily from the tax deconsolidation of Cruise. Regarding earnings results cadence, we expect second half to be stronger than the first half, primarily as a result of some of the production downtime we will take in certain plants to manage the semiconductor supply shortages.  Finally, I want to spend a minute on capital allocation. The top priority for us is to invest in both new and existing businesses, including previously announced investments to accelerate EV and AV growth while reducing complexity and leveraging current architectures across the ICE portfolio to drive better productivity and customer response, which will help fund investments in our future. To support this growth strategy, in 2021, we will spend more capital on EV and AV product programs than on gasoline and diesel power development for the first time in our history.  Our capital allocation plan includes more than $6 billion spending on EV and $1 billion on AV in 2021, and we will fund key growth initiatives such as BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance Services, subscription services like Super Cruise and OnStar Guardian aimed at accessing new addressable markets that we have never tapped before, representing a significant top line growth opportunity. We will fund these growth investments with internally generated cash while maintaining our investment-grade balance sheet.  In summary, we had a strong finish to the year, highlighting the underlying strength of our business. We have again demonstrated our strength, flexibility, laser focus on execution and ability to manage through a significant disruption while still generating strong results. This focus will continue in '21 as we manage the challenges of the industry-wide semiconductor shortage while continuing to launch new and exciting products and services and position to GM -- position GM to win in the future of mobility, and I'm proud to be a part of this team.  This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Congratulations on the performance. I actually had two longer-term questions I wanted to ask you. One is, you alluded that some of the growth initiatives could result in new brands like BrightDrop but notice that BrightDrop is continuing to use the independent dealer model. Obviously, independent dealers make some money. They do cleave off some gross margin and F&I per vehicle, which some of the new entrants are suggesting is kind of a disadvantage for existing players. I'm wondering if there are changes to the way that BrightDrop is -- the franchise agreements work that kind of levels the playing field with new entrants. Mary Barra : So Rod, just in general, we see our dealers as a huge asset to the company. They have -- they're responsible for partnering with us to deliver industry-leading sales and service. And so of course, as the industry transforms, as the customer expects different things, both retail and fleet from a BrightDrop perspective, we know and we are working with our dealers and they're transforming as well. And there, especially, there's a huge percentage of our dealers that are very excited about the EV transformation and the opportunity. And we've been working, and frankly, it accelerated last year during the pandemic, of ways that we can better support the customer, meet them where they want to be and take cost out of both of our business to improve both. So that's the journey that we're on. I'm not going to -- for competitive reasons, I'm not sharing all of the specific changes and transformation activities that we're doing but they're pretty substantial. And like I said, our dealers are very much engaged and excited about that. Rod Lache : Okay. And just secondly, you mentioned subscription services. And actually, one of your slides mentions that your next-generation electronic architecture is going to be available on 29 different models by 2023. It sounds like you think that the vehicles that you sell have the potential to become platforms for deploying services and features that you could charge for. So I was hoping you can maybe give us a little bit more insight into the potential there. Sounds like Super Cruise is one of these things. But what is the sort of projected population of vehicles that you're going to be targeting? What are the kinds of subscriptions that you think you might be able to generate? Mary Barra : So Rod, we're very excited about the opportunity we have to present services, especially as we now have the vehicle intelligent platform, which is our new electrical architecture underpinning the entire vehicle. And it protects the vehicle from a cyber safety perspective as well as gives us tremendous over-the-air updates and the ability to do -- provide services on demand.  You mentioned Super Cruise, that is one that will have the ability to do. There are several other opportunities that we're exploring and frankly working on right now. Again, we haven't announced any of them publicly, but I will tell you, we have a whole team across our sales and marketing team partnering with our engineering team and software engineers. So, you'll hear more about this as we go forward, but we think it's going to be a huge growth opportunity for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Just had one financial and one strategic question. On the financial question, I was hoping you could quantify for the 2021 bridge just the raw material impact that you're expecting as well just the volume impact embedded in the estimates for the semiconductor shortage. Paul Jacobson : Sure. So, for the commodities first, we\u2019ve seen about 120% increase in steel and PGM prices over the last, really, kind of since May of last year. That's a couple of billion dollars. I would say that we're making some strides to offset that, and we're going to continue to target where we can in order to drive savings to help offset that, but that's rough order of magnitude what we've included in our numbers. And of course, there's always some lag in terms of being able to respond to those prices. On the volume side, I would say that we -- these numbers are moving around rapidly, and between building vehicles that we will go back and retrofit with the components later in the second half and managing through second half makeup volumes, it's premature to talk about the volumes at this point in time, but that's where we've come up with the $1.5 billion to $2 billion net of the initiatives that we think we can bring together to help offset through this. Itay Michaeli : Great. That's very helpful, Paul. And then on the strategic question, wanted to focus on the AV part of the story and really kind of 2 parts to the question. First, on Cruise, just given the progress we're seeing in the California reports. I was hoping you'd update us on the latest thinking from yourselves and the Cruise team around when Cruise deploys, do you compete with -- against rideshare networks or do you partner with them or both? Just love some updated thoughts there. And then on the kind of AV investment inside of GM, it sounds like you're accelerating that as well. I was hoping, perhaps Mary, you could talk about the plan around the zero crash vision. How do we think about AV deployment within the GM vehicles, let's say, over the next 5 years? And kind of what kind of path should we expect there? Mary Barra : Sure, Itay, and thanks for the question. I'm really excited because if you look at the fact that we're going to be putting Super Cruise on multiple vehicles and the strong customer reaction we've gotten from them, and that continues to grow and definitely contributes to a safer world, a zero crashes world, and we've talked about the next generation of Super Cruise, and that will have even more capability that we'll be able to provide to vehicles and, in some cases, launch and provide additional functionality over the air, so that's something that will be quite significant by 2025.  Then when you go to Cruise, they continue to hit their milestones. They're on track from a safety perspective because we've always said safety will be our overriding priority. They're also working on making sure the ride is enjoyable from a customer perspective. And again, they're making progress, I'm very enthused. You know that they're testing right now in San Francisco without drivers in the vehicle in certain situations. I'm not going to put a specific time frame on when we'll launch commercially, but the progress we're making puts us in a very good place that, that's not years away like people think or have talked about it. From -- are we in a partner with existing rideshares? We have the ability to go and launch our own service. We already have our own application that is being leveraged by our employees right now. So we have -- I think when we are in a position that we can take the driver out of the vehicle from a -- and launch the business commercially, we'll have many opportunities, and we'll do what's going to drive the biggest value from a shareholder perspective. But I think at that point, you can think of it like a platform. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : First, a financial question and then a longer-term one as well. So on the financial side, it seems like there was very strong price/mix, very strong volume contribution in North America. But then at the same time, I think that there was a bit of a cost headwind, even excluding the airbag recall. And I think your slides talk about some warranty and materials performance. And so I wanted to see if you could give a little bit more detail around what happened specifically in North American cost in the quarter. And how do you think about it in your bridge to 2021? Paul Jacobson : Emmanuel, it's Paul. The -- you mentioned the biggest one, obviously, was Takata in there. But I would say the other two were primarily really related to content and major materials. So we've taken a conscious effort in the new line of full-size SUVs to improve content. And you're seeing that in the pricing offsets and what we're able to get in the market. These are content improvements that consumers really love and they're willing to pay for and we feel good about that. And then there's a little slug of commodity pressure that we saw in the fourth quarter, probably about 60-40 between materials and commodities, so that remaining piece. Emmanuel Rosner : And just on this sort of thinking about 2021, is it fair to then assume in a continued pressure, I guess, from the materials cost, excluding commodities, the content cost? Paul Jacobson : Yes. I would say that content is a good reflection of where we're heading, especially in terms of the volume of full-size SUVs and trucks. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, great. And I guess on the electrification side, looking a bit longer term. Now you have a few very strong milestones that you've put out there, more than 1 million units BEV by 2025, and then obviously, 100%, I guess, by 2035, and then several high volumes in North America by 2023. Can you give us a sort of like a holistic view of how you think, since we get deployed, what sort of segments or time line can we expect? When can we learn more from General Motors around the bridge to get you to this 1 million units by 2025 and to get you to the 100% by 2035? What models will make this up and on what time line? Mary Barra : Sure, Emmanuel. Well, I think we're really excited. We're launching the Chevrolet Bolt EUV and next generation Bolt EV this week. And so that starts, I think, a very positive momentum, especially when you look at the affordability of the Bolt and the -- well, Bolt EV and the Bolt EUV. Later this year, we'll have the GMC Hummer. Early next year, we'll have the Cadillac CELESTIQ. We've also announced the Cadillac -- or excuse me, the Cadillac LYRIQ, and then we'll have -- we've already shared the Cadillac CELESTIQ, which is really a flagship. And you'll just see a steady launch of vehicles because we've said 2/3 of the 30 by '25 will be in the United States. You'll hear more about which vehicles are coming in what order as we start to move through the year. But I would say, as you then -- so that -- and from competitive reasons, we're not going to share too much but we'll continue to share more as we get closer to these launches as we go through this year and next.  When you start to look at 2035, right now, we're a full-line manufacturer. And so we will cover the full line and more when you think about products like BrightDrop and then our first mile, last mile. You put on top of that the services that will be available through the vehicle that we've talked about, subscription service. And then you put things like insurance that we think we can do very well with the learnings we have from our connected vehicles. So it will be a full line broader than we have right now, and that's all enabled by the LTM platform. And we intend to take share and grow overall as we do this with the number of vehicles sold as well as the growth opportunities that sit on top from a services and other businesses perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Mary, I just wanted to ask a question. I mean you're really accelerating the advancement of your EV and AV technology much faster than people would have thought not too long ago. But there's the risk of creating some obsolescence around your core ICE products. And it seems like we're going to reach this tipping point in the next few years. So I'm just kind of trying to understand, I mean, a pessimist may say, hey, you're going to blow up to residuals and you're going to have a real problem. An optimist might say, you're going to create a real super cycle for demand. So just curious how you're thinking about that and how you might manage that. Mary Barra : Well, John, it's an excellent question. And I definitely think it presents a super cycle opportunity for us. When you look at our ICE business and the platforms we invested in over the last 5 years, we're well positioned and that's what puts us in a place where we can be investing more in EV and AV than we are in ICE. And so we're going to leverage the platforms that we already have. The strong franchises in full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, midsize crossovers, and I'm also super excited about products like the Chevrolet Trailblazer and the Encore. So we have a really strong portfolio of products as we make this transition that's going to need limited investment. And then we're demonstrating right now, we also have a very capable manufacturing team, manufacturing workforce. We're transitioning the Detroit-Hamtramck plant right now, Factory ZERO, to build electric vehicles. We've also announced Spring Hill. So we have a very well thought through plan of how we will transition our manufacturing facilities to electric vehicles. We can do it in a pretty short time frame. And with the shorter vehicle development process we have for EVs, those 2 go hand-in-hand. And in some cases, investment that we're making to increase our ICE vehicles, we're doing that with a mind for what it will take to then have a quicker, less expensive conversion to EVs.  So it's a very well-integrated plan. We'll be customer-driven, but we're working hard to create a delightful EV ownership experience with the right range, the right charging, the services on top of it and the connectivity that we think we can grow as we make this transition and not have stranded assets. John Murphy : Okay, that's incredibly helpful. And then just a second question around the chip shortage. I mean when we saw production disruptions and supply shortages last year, what it really resulted in was very -- obviously, tight inventory but very, very strong mix and a focus on your more highly profitable vehicles. I'm just curious, as you go through this process of working through the chip shortage, hopefully be done sometime later this year, how you reallocate these chips to vehicles, how much fungibility there is? And could we be in another environment where mix just remains incredibly strong and offsets some of this potential weakness in production volume? And just how much of that is kind of encompassed in this $1.5 billion to $2 billion EBIT hit you're talking about with the chip shortage? Paul Jacobson : John, it's Paul. What I would say is that, obviously, the situation is very fluid, and you've seen that from various manufacturers across the board. And what I would say is we're adapting to kind of focus production on two things. Number one, those vehicles that have higher margins and provide better contribution for us. But also with the full-size SUVs and the trucks, they're already operating at full capacity and project it to pretty much for the entire year. So the makeup volume in the back half of the year is harder. So where we are taking chips from are vehicles where we either have a little bit more inventory or more importantly, we've got production gaps in the back half of the year or capacity to be able to make that up. So it's very fluid as we're managing through this but that's all baked into the numbers that we gave earlier. John Murphy : And then just one quick housekeeping on the dividend. It sounds like the growth investment CapEx, R&D, everything you're doing is going to crowd out the dividend for a little while. Is that a fair statement? Or will there be a rethinking around the dividend sometime this year? Mary Barra : Well, we talked at the end of Q3, we talked about having a dividend that's the right size and at the right time. We continue to be dedicated to that. But we are very much focusing on the first pillar of our capital allocation strategy, which is to invest in growth businesses. So you'll hear more from us later this year as it relates to the dividend. But I think the focus that we have on growth and what we're investing in growth is going to provide a really strong return for our shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Just the first question on the chip shortage. I was wondering if you could help us think through maybe some of the cash flow and working capital timing impact. I know you gave the impact that's included in the guidance. But it would seem like with some of the strategies you're employing, it might be a little bit more of a working capital drain in the first half relative to the EBIT impact and then maybe a recovery in the back half. Is that correct? Paul Jacobson : Joe, it's Paul. I think that's an accurate assessment. I mean we do expect some choppiness in the near term as we're altering production managing through this as well as you mentioned if we're building vehicles and then coming back to retrofit them. So we do see a bigger working capital and EBIT impact in the first half of the year. And then the expectation is that we'll be able to make up for that in the second half.  Also incorporated into our numbers, our cash impact guide, if you noticed, was a little bit wider than our EBIT guide. That's due in part to we were planning, going into the year, on having a little bit of a build and inventory level benefiting working capital that as we make up production volumes in the second half, depending on how the semiconductor situation works itself out, we could see a year-end where inventories are flat or -- and not have that working capital benefit that we might otherwise see, which is why we put a little bit more cash impact into it. Joseph Spak : And then the second question is -- and Paul, welcome to GM. But -- and I guess I just want to get your sort of view here as someone that's looking at General Motors with some relatively fresh eyes and I think somewhat of a reputation as being a creative thinker and an ability to help realize value. As you look at GM's assets and balance sheets, I mean how do you think about unlocking further value? And what do you see as the opportunities that may be underappreciated by the market? Paul Jacobson : Well, first of all, thanks for that welcome, Joe. And I'm not sure who you were talking to but I appreciate it, nonetheless. What I would say is that there's tremendous opportunity here to help the market understand that we're really transitioning from what I would say has been historically kind of an old-school industrial-type mindset for the market to a real technologically savvy, growth-oriented company that's really going into a lot of new markets.  And as we see those continue to develop and we continue to ratchet success stories like Cruise and what I believe BrightDrop will be as well as the EV portfolio, I think there's a lot of opportunity here to drive value for our shareholders. And that's ultimately what sold me on coming here to join Mary and the team. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : I was going to ask Mary why she hates Norway so much but in the interest of time, we'll move on. Look, I'm not worried about the chip shortage, Mary. I'm worried about the battery shortage. What we're seeing is in the next few quarters or couple of years, the potential for real serious supply/demand imbalance on EV cells. Now fortunately, you're pretty close to the bread truck and you've used your vision to get -- to kind of secure, on a relative basis, a lot better supply domestically and otherwise. But this seems like a real problem. I'm curious, Mary, at a high level, whether you and the team, based on what you see all the way up to the mines on the surface of the earth with the metals, do you see a risk of a cell supply constraint that could really impact volume for the broader EV industry over the next couple of years at this point? And then I have a follow-up. Mary Barra : Adam, well, as we look at it, of course, our purchasing and supply team knows the projections that we have, the volume that we have by year, and we're working to make sure we have adequate supply all the way from the mines. You rightly point that it's one of the reasons why we're investing in our own cell manufacturer. And as I kind of alluded to in my opening remarks, there's more coming than what we've announced already. So we want to be in control of our own destiny, not only from making sure we have the ability to have the cells that we need but also to work on cost improvements and technology improvements. I would also say, the work that we have the joint partnership with LG Chem, not just for manufacturing but also development. We also have significant resources in our R&D, and we're also looking, as part of our cost-out plan, to need less precious metals. So we're working at it from all angles. We know it's strategically critical for our future and so the right attention is placed on it. Adam Jonas : And just a follow-up. It is a question on bitcoin. It's inevitable. I might as well just rip the band-aid off, right, Mary? A growing number of high-profile companies including a major competitor are owning bitcoin and crypto as a way to diversify and maximize their cash holdings and treasury outcomes in a world where fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar are being debased and the purchasing power eroding and also the potential means of payment. I mean a $45,000 BTC is optimal for a big ticket purchase like a car. So how does GM think about this opportunity? And yes, this is a very serious question actually. How do you think about this opportunity? Is this something that GM would consider? And what would be the signpost that your team would need to see in treasury in order to move in that direction? Mary Barra : Sure, Adam. Well, first of all, we don't have any plans to invest in bitcoin, so full stop there. This is something we'll monitor and we'll evaluate. And if there's strong customer demand for it in the future, there's nothing that precludes us from doing that. So taking your question very seriously, that's my answer.  And I do want to answer your Norway question. I'm 97% Finnish, so I like all the Scandinavian countries. We're actually very -- we look at what Norway has accomplished from EVs, and we think it's a message to have -- make everyone aware and drive awareness and adoption of EVs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : At GM's EV Day in March of last year, you introduced a target of selling 1 million, I think, Ultium-powered battery electric vehicles between North America and China by the middle of the decade. I don't recall as much discussion of EVs not powered by Ultium batteries. Although I see 1 example, the Wuling Hong Guang Mini EV has, in some recent months, been selling 33,000 or 35,000 units, an annualized run rate of 400,000. So can you tell us a little bit more about the demand you're seeing for these other attainable GM EVs in China and what kind of market you think there could be for them? Do you see the potential to export to markets outside of China? And should we think about their volume being incremental to the 1 million units discussed at the EV Day? Mary Barra : So we're really proud of what our Wuling partner, SGMW, has been able to accomplish. And when we talked about Battery Day, Ultium is our new platform and we are going to continue to roll that out, and we see significant volume coming after that. When -- coming from that, I should say. When we look at the greater than 1 million units by mid-decade, that includes our products in GM China with our joint ventures as well as in the U.S. But that's just a starting point and then we're going to continue to grow LTM as well as potential products, like you say, with the Hong Guang and the EV Mini that have the opportunity to continue to grow. We're always looking at where the right growth is inside and outside of China, but I don't have anything specific to share right now. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. And then just lastly, wanted to check in on GM Financial after the strong result there. I think while the business is benefiting from gains on the sale of off-lease vehicles, given the step-up in residuals, that also the underlying earnings might be growing also on the harvesting of earlier investments. So when should we expect the off-lease tailwinds to subside? And then when they do, what do you think is the underlying earnings power of GM Financial? Daniel Berce : Yes, this is Dan Berce speaking. So we're guiding to earnings of -- for 2021 of about $2.5 billion, which is comparable to what we made this year of $2.7 billion EBT. We do expect good gains on residuals again in 2021. We guided to residuals being down low single digits but we're comping to what was a record year in 2020. We're starting the year quite well from an auction standpoint, beating last year's numbers. But the tough comps from a residual standpoint will really be the second half of the year. Even if prices are down a couple of points in 2021, they will still be comparable to where they were in 2019. So leases we made in 2018, 2019, there's -- we expect really good favorability when they come off-lease. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Since most of the housekeeping questions have been addressed, I want to talk about GM Hydrotec. We knew about the Nikola refocused on fuel cells. Navistar was a bit of a surprise. And in fact, the whole renaissance of your fuel cell business is a bit of a surprise. I do remember the Larry Burns Day. So it was the technology of the future that was never quite the future. But now it looks like there's real opportunities there in the commercial vehicle market. So just wondering, in particular, can you talk about where the Hydrotec technology is versus competing fuel cell solutions in terms of cost per kilowatt and other key factors? Mary Barra : Well, we're really excited about the potential of Hydrotec. And when you look at commercial trucks, defense, aerospace and stationary backup power, the situations where you need large quantities of energy over extended periods of time to move heavy payloads. So that's where hydrogen fuel cells are really most applicable. And so we see hydrogen fuel cells as well as EVs being part of the solution. I was here for -- when we started working on fuel cells. We've never stopped and we have a very productive partnership with Honda. So I think we've invested appropriately and shared that investment to be efficient. So I think there's huge opportunity. We're very pleased with our partnership with Navistar, and they'll have vehicles on the road in 2024. So the time has come. Brian Johnson : And just as a follow-on. Given that's not core to the passenger personal use mobility business, unlike EVs where you did roll out a spin-off but perhaps more like Cruise, where the structure of the way it's set up kind of contemplates maybe at some point monetization. How would you think about Hydrotec along that spectrum of core could ever consider monetizing to if the price is right, it could go its own way? Mary Barra : Well, I think, as I've said repeatedly, we will always do what's in the long-term best interest of our shareholders to unlock the most value, so we are committed to doing that. We're in the early days of Hydrotec with -- and also with our GM Defense business and in other opportunities. So right now, we're focused on the growth opportunity that's in front of us. And if at some point, there's a different structure that would enable that growth to be even faster, we'll definitely consider it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Welcome to the team, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Dan. Dan Levy : First question, I wanted to ask about EV. And I think you've mentioned in your opening remarks, you've had discussions with the new administration. And I think we know a big part of EV uptake until now and likely for the foreseeable future is likely the role of government in setting policies, encouraging uptake and you're doing commercials on Norway. Norway has been one of the most aggressive in policies encouraging uptake.  You have this new 2035 zero-emission target. Can you tell us what your baseline assumption is for increased regulation in the coming years to encourage EV uptake? How aggressive do you expect the government to be? Or would you advocate for the government to be -- would you advocate for the government, the U.S. government, to institute a ban on combustion vehicles by 2035, similar to what we've seen from other countries? Mary Barra : I think our focus, Dan, is really on delighting the customer with an incredible ownership experience of allowing them to have the vehicle and the segments that they want at the price point that fits their life. And then having the right range, making sure the whole ecosystem supports them from a charging perspective, whether it's home charging, at work, when they're making long-distance trips or if they live in an apartment and how do we make sure they have regular available and dependable charging infrastructure. So I think there's a huge amount of opportunity with business partnering with government to make sure the infrastructure is there to support it.  We do want to see the EV tax credit. We think there's a period of time where that's still important. And frankly, we'd like to see that not penalize first movers. But generally, we are very much focused on delighting the customer with the overall ownership experience, having the right vehicles and making sure every aspect of their ownership is a step above what is today. That's really going to drive the adoption we need. Dan Levy : Okay, okay. And then a second question on this 2035 target, which it is the first time you put out firm timing on this target. And I think the word that you used in the release is aspire rather than a hard firm target, which makes sense because it's 15 years out. But maybe you could walk us through the factors that you think could accelerate or challenge your ability to meet this target? What is the largest factor determining the ability to meet the target between cost improvements on EV, addressing the transmission and engine capacity, challenges to be downsized, challenges on distribution or just broadly on U.S. consumer acceptance and product? So what needs to be done to hit this 2035 target? Because you used the word aspire rather than a hard line in the sand. Mary Barra : Well, clearly, customers will drive this and what customers want. And that's why we're focused on creating that excellent customer experience that I just talked about. But there's really nothing holding General Motors back. We have the manufacturing capability. We have the LTM platform, and we already have the second generation of technology that's being worked to further take cost out and allow energy density to increase, which all benefits the consumer. We have the Ultifi-ed buying, and know how we will provide the customer experience, and we're partnering with our dealers to make sure it's in order of magnitude, better customer experience from an ownership perspective. The services, whether it's subscription or what's offered in the vehicle from a connectivity is another thing we think where we can completely delight the customer and build on the fact that we have leading technology right now.  So to me, there's not 1 big factor that's going to hold us up. We have all the assets to achieve this. We've got to solve issues and win customers, but I think we're well positioned to do that across the portfolio. And that's why we see such a tremendous growth opportunity for General Motors. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Philippe Houchois : Following on to this discussion about this aspiration and your target or aspiration for 2035. I'm trying to understand, thinking 10 years out or so. If we assume that SAAR grows relatively slowly in a mature market and GM targets no ICE by 2035, what happens if adoption is lagging significantly, let's say, 50% or so? Logically, GM must be prepared to either shrink volume or compensate hardware revenue with other source of revenue. And keeping in mind, for me, shrinking if you got more growth and better margin, it's not, let's say, negative for the markets. It's quite the contrary. Expectedly, if you don't want to shrink or not planning to shrink, you need to work on squeezing your competitors especially basically making their growth in EVs more difficult. I'm just trying to understand strategically, over the next 10, 15 years, is GM ready to shrink or is GM going to be aggressive? I'm trying to understand. Or am I missing something? Mary Barra : I think we're going to be aggressive because I think we've got the technology, we've got the talent. We have the manufacturing capability. We already sell more vehicles in the United States and we're 2 in China. So I think we're well positioned because of our current brand strength around the world and our position and then with the technology that we're bringing forward. So we don't plan on shrinking. We plan on growing, especially if you look at in the United States on the coast, we don't get what I would say is our fair share of the market. That's a growth opportunity right there.  But we think we're extremely well positioned. And we -- again, I can't underestimate how much opportunity we have with the LTM platform because of the modularity of it that we can take so many vehicles across so many segments price points to really delight the customers. So that's our focus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Christopher McNally : Mary, I wanted to follow up on the questions on Cruise. And I know you can't be too specific on exactly when a launch would happen or even maybe a more extensive beta testing of a program in San Francisco. But could you at least maybe talk about some of the ambition to test aggressively in other cities for whenever a commercial launch or beta launch was to happen? Could we expect multiple launches sort of in succession on a sort of an annual type basis? Mary Barra : I think you will see that we talked very early on that once we have launched in 1 city, the opportunity to go to the next to do the work, to make sure the technology, is adaptable to the unique things of another city. So I think once we launch successfully and demonstrate that the technology is safer than a human driver and we demonstrate to customers, I think that we can really increase the number of cities that we're offering it quite quickly, and that's what we'll focus on doing. Christopher McNally : And then finally, the rationale behind the tax deconsolidation of Cruise, it's super interesting. I'm just curious, does it ever make sense that Cruise is its own separately listed assets so that funding options would be obviously much broader than internal or external private investors? Paul Jacobson : Chris, it's Paul. So I would say those two issues are pretty separate and distinct from each other. The tax deconsolidation is really just mechanical because our ownership is below the required thresholds to consolidate for tax. And obviously, with their spend and their growth, we benefited from that, which is why we're seeing a tax increase with the deconsolidation. I think what we've proven out with the last round of funding is an ability to partner and raise external capital alongside the strength and the foundation that GM provides. So I think access to capital is really unconstrained the way we think about it right now, and we bored that out in the last fundraising round. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. Jairam Nathan : I have two questions, one for Mary, one for Paul. For Mary, longer term, do you see EVs as an opportunity to enter -- reenter Europe with a clean slate, especially given governments have been more conducive to giving incentives to EVs? I believe EVs amounted for like 10% penetration in the fourth quarter of 2020. What's your thoughts around that? Mary Barra : There's nothing that precludes us with the sale of Opel/Vauxhall to do that. We already have our iconic products in Europe right now with Cadillac and the Chevrolet Corvette, et cetera. So there's nothing that precludes us and I think it's a natural growth opportunity for us as well. Jairam Nathan : Okay. And Paul, coming from an industry which benefited significantly from consolidation, what are your thoughts for the automotive industry there? Paul Jacobson : I think that's a bit of a trick question. But I think they're obviously very different industries across the board. I think there's some similarities in that the industries are both capitally intensive. But what we have here is much more of a platform to create a growth model. And I think we saw some of that in my past life as well. But really here, it's about diversifying the business. It's about growing into the increasing tipping point-like demand of EVs and AV technology going forward. And when you combine that with the strength in the brands and the capabilities of GM, I think we've got a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Barra : Thank you. Well, first of all, I appreciate all of you joining, and thanks for the great questions this morning. I hope you know and see that it's overwhelmingly true that we are at an inflection point on sustainability, on inclusion and diversity and on growth that will deliver shareholder value not just this quarter but for many years to come. I hope that's coming into even sharper focus for all of you.  Every quarter moving forward, you can expect to hear us advance our story. I believe we have the talent, the technology, the profitability and the balance sheet to lead, and we will continue to innovate and I look forward to sharing more in the months ahead. So thank you. Please take care and stay safe. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

During the opening remarks all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, May 5, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks Tabitha. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM Investor Relations website. As usual we're also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined today by GM's Chairman and CEO, Mary Barra; GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson; and GM Financial President, Dan Berce. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Good morning and thanks for joining our first quarter earnings call. Our start to this year was very strong with a record Q1 performance that was driven largely by robust product demand in the US, as well as an outstanding quarter for GM Financial. We remain confident that we will achieve our full year guidance. We are on a path to transform our company on the timeline we have shared with you and we are demonstrating our ability to accelerate our plan. Before I discuss the progress, we've made on our transformation and growth strategy, I'll provide some highlights about our performance. I'm very pleased with the strength of our global business which contributed to EBIT-adjusted of 4.4 billion and an EPS diluted adjusted of $2.25. The strong quarter was a full team effort with people working in our plants all the way to our dealers. Global purchasing and supply chain, engineering and manufacturing have been especially nimble and opportunistic as we manage through the semiconductor shortage. For example, our engineers are creating effective solutions using chips that are more readily available or by identifying alternatives to conserve semiconductors where possible. Their work helped us maximize production of our highest demand and capacity constraint vehicles, reducing downtime and further demonstrating our team's agility. While we have production downtime in the second quarter, we expect to have a strong first half with EBIT adjusted around 5.5 billion ish. We are also reaffirming our guidance for the full year and based on what we know today, we see the results coming in at the higher end of the $10 to $11 billion EBIT-adjusted range that we shared earlier this year. We remain committed to fund $7 billion in EV and AV investments that includes capital and engineering this year and accelerating 12 EV programs as we first announced last November. Paul will discuss our Q1 numbers and outlook in more detail in a few minutes. Looking ahead, I think there are many reasons why we are confident. For starters, we have great product momentum. Despite tight inventories, we maintain a clear lead in the full-size SUV market in the US and our full-size pickups are in high demand. In China, our sales are rebounding sharply with the economy and Cadillac achieved a record first quarter led by its SUV lineup of XT4, XT5 and XT6. In addition, we are executing one of the fastest production launches in our history. Last November we said we would return full-size pickup production to Oshawa assembly in Canada in early 2022. Because of the team speed, we are pulling the start of retail production ahead into the fourth quarter of this year. The new timeline and incremental volume will begin to have a meaningful impact next year as we ramp up production. But I'm sharing it with you now as another example of how we are working urgently to achieve key milestones. Let's turn now to our growth strategy starting with a battery update. We intend to lead on all aspects of battery development and cost reduction. And we are moving quickly on every front. Our vertical integration approach to battery technology, which includes building our own cells, will help us scale quickly and efficiently to deploy new innovative chemistries that boost energy density and reduce costs over time. Ultium batteries are unique in the industry because of their large format pouch style cells that can be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack. This allows engineers to optimize better battery energy storage and layout for each vehicle design. Depending on the vehicle, Ultium enables a GM estimated range of up to 450 miles or more on a full charge with zero to 60 miles per hour acceleration in three seconds. As we've previously said, we realized - we will realize a 40% battery cost reduction with our first generation Ultium platform compared with today's Chevrolet Bolt EV and we're already on the road to delivering a 60% cost reduction compared to the Bolt EV with the next-generation of Ultium and we expect costs will continue to decrease from there. Currently, our next-gen lithium metal prototypes have completed about 150,000 simulated test miles and we expect them to have nearly double the energy density of our current EV batteries. The team has already secured 49 patents for GM's lithium metal battery development with another 45 pending. Our own work along with the intellectual property from SolidEnergy Systems will form the basis of our recent joint development agreement with SES, one of the companies we're working with commercialize lithium metal batteries. We are targeting production of our next-gen Ultium battery by mid-decade and we're also expanding our battery cell manufacturing footprint to control our costs and cell supply. Last month Ultium Cells LLC our joint venture with LG Energy Solution announced its second high volume battery cell plant in the United States. And construction begins immediately on the site adjacent to our Spring Hill assembly plant in Tennessee. The new facility will create about 1300 new manufacturing jobs when it comes online in late 2023. It will join the Ultium Cell LLC facility in Lordstown that is opening next year. And this is just the beginning and will continue to expand our battery cell capacity on our way to achieving our goal of EV market share leadership in North America. Let's turn now to our Ultium powered products. During the quarter we unveiled the second new Hummer EV the 2024 GMC Hummer EV SUV, which launches in 2023. And will we build at Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck. It will be available loaded with new GM developed software driven technologies including CrabWalk, Extract Mode and many more features that are either industry leading or segment differentiators. The Cadillac team unveiled the stunning LYRIQ production model which we accelerated by nine months. And as we've previously said, we have cut the development time of most of our EV's in half because of our use of virtual engineering and other software tools. Cadillac will take reservations beginning in September with initial availability in the first half of 2022. We were also excited to confirm that Chevrolet will introduce a Silverado full-size electric pickup truck for retail and fleet buyers, with a GM estimated 400 miles of range on a full charge for certain configurations. The initial interest has been overwhelming, especially from commercial and government customers. We gave a small number of them a sneak peek at the interior and exterior design. They said it exceeded their high expectations with zero emissions, long range, pickup capability, innovative storage and strong value along with a powerful design. What's especially important is that this truck will be in a high volume entry, and one of the most popular and competitive segments in the industry. In addition to Ultium propulsion Super Cruise is a feature that connects all of these vehicles in an increasing number of vehicles we're selling today. Since its debut in 2017, Super Cruise has twice been ranked as the best driver assistance technology in the industry by a leading third-party consumer group. Super Cruise is enhancing our reputation, elevating our brands, and laying the foundation to generate substantial feature subscription revenue for us as we move forward. To creatively illustrate how fun and liberating Super Cruise can be Cadillac recently wrapped up it's Time to Let Go campaign. It captured celebrities as they drove the 2021 Cadillac Escalade with Super Cruise and its new lane change capability. It was really fun to watch the reactions, and how people quickly shifted from being cautiously curious to just pure excitement. We'll roll out Super Cruise to 22 models by the end of 2023 and we plan to add even more features. Our ultimate vision is that this system enables hands free transportation in 95% of driving scenario. What makes our large scale deployment of Super Cruise and all of its new features possible is our vehicle intelligence platform or VIP, which connects every vehicle system into one advanced high speed and very secure network. VIP's 4.5 terabytes of data processing power per hour represents a fivefold increase from our previous electrical architecture. That's enough capacity to manage all of the data loads of our self-driving technology, driver assistance systems, electric propulsion, over the air updates of every vehicle module plus capacity to manage feature applications. It's also an enabler for software as a service, including new apps and capabilities that we can market to our customers such as the latest must have trailering and parking apps. By the end of '23, VIP will be on 7 million vehicles in 38 Global models. Another major element of our growth strategy is our Bright Drop commercial delivery business and it is progressing and on track. In March our product and manufacturing teams reached an important milestone as they conducted EV600 prototype builds. Plans to build the Bright Drop EV600 at Cadillac's - excuse me at GM Canada's CAMI assembly and Ingersoll are progressing rapidly. The Bright Drop team remains on track to reach its goal of delivering EV600's to its first customer FedEx Express by Q4 of this year. Interest is high and we continue to have active discussions with many prospective new customers who are seeking the efficient and zero emission delivery solutions that Bright Drop offers. And this is encouraging as third parties estimate that the addressable market for eLCV's could be $3 billion by 2025 and double that in 2030. As our EV volumes grow, we are also investing in relationships to build a robust, reliable and easy to use public charging infrastructure. Last week we revealed Ultium Charge 360 an innovative and holistic approach that integrates charging networks, GM vehicle mobile apps and other products and services to simplify the charging experience for GM EV owners. It builds on our existing work and partnerships to support a charging ecosystem that will give GM EV owners more confidence and convenience. We have signed agreements with seven major charging networks giving customers a more seamless access to nearly 60,000 plugs across the US and China. As part of our existing collaboration with EVgo we've opened the first three fast charging stations in California, Florida and Washington, on our way to 2700 plugs by the end of 2025 and we expect about 500 fast charging stalls to go live by the end of this year. We'll continue to provide updates about Ultium Charge 360 including new elements and collaboration. The last major EV development I want to share follows up on our joint announcement last year with Honda that we will co-develop two Ultium based EVs for Honda to be built in North America by the GM team. Honda recently confirmed these vehicles, a large SUV for the Honda brand and one for the Acura brand, and will launch in North America market for the 2024 model year. This further validates our Ultium technology, and we continue to work closely with Honda to expand our partnership and cooperation in key areas such as purchasing, research and development and connected services. Turning to AVs, Cruise continues to establish itself as a leading force and commercializing self-driving vehicle technology. In the latest funding round that closed after raising 2.75 billion, it included investments from Microsoft and Walmart. And this brings the valuation of Cruise to more than $30 billion, with GM continuing to own a majority stake. Cruise is moving steadily closer to commercialization. Its real world driverless vehicle testing in San Francisco and its last mile delivery pilot with Walmart in Scottsdale, Arizona will help pave the way for new commitments like the one Cruise just signed with the city of Dubai. Cruise will be the city's exclusive provider of self-driving taxis and ride hailing services with plans to deploy up to 4000 self-driving vehicles by 2030. Dubai chose Cruise over several competitors. So it's another great validation of Cruise's technology and our overall approach to autonomous vehicles. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to quickly update you on our coronavirus measures. We remain diligent and disciplined with our safety protocols to keep employees safe as variants and new hotspots emerge. The GM medical team continues to monitor new COVID-19 cases globally and our vaccine task force teams are working to understand vaccine administration priorities for each country and determine how we can best assist our employees, including operating vaccine clinics in several of our US facilities. All the work GM medical has done behind the scenes was crucial as we restarted production last spring. And their work has helped the rest of the team stay focused on driving our business today and driving our growth strategy. I also want to recognize the entire GM team for its hard work flexibility and resilience. In addition to our suppliers and our dealers who are helping us manage the semiconductor issues, we are also working to serve our customers and leveraging everything we can do to turn inventory quickly. Everyone has been remarkably dedicated, and it shows in our results, and we appreciate everyone's hard work. This is just the beginning for the next generation of General Motors. We are well on track with our plans to transform our company and lead the industry into the future. And we are pleased with the significant progress we have made on all fronts during the quarter. We look forward to building under strong momentum and providing a more comprehensive update on our growth initiatives and progress later in the year. We plan to have an investor event in the Detroit area and we'll announce a date later in the summer because we would like this event to be face to face. We'll use this event to go deeper into our growth strategy and financial opportunities and everything that drives them including software, hardware and services, along with our strong brands. So with that, I'll turn it over to Paul to provide more details on our financial performance and our full year guidance. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us this morning. This has been a very exciting first full quarter for me at GM. I see so much opportunity here for us to use our world class capabilities in manufacturing, engineering and customer loyalty to really leverage these with our scale to achieve our growth initiatives. First to set the stage before I get into the details, we had a great quarter, a first quarter record in fact, despite the volatile backdrop. Our strong Q1 performance continues to highlight the resiliency of our business, as well as our ability to take decisive actions to adapt to the fluid supply chain environment. In Q1 for example, we were able to build in wholesale more vehicles than forecasted and defer anticipated plant downtime. This strong operational execution combined with the additional actions on price and expense reductions enabled us to deliver stronger than expected results for the quarter. We are collaborating across the global supply chain and working tirelessly to route available parts to the appropriate plants in order to maximize plant efficiency. We've been focused on leveraging every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products, including our highly profitable full-size pickups and full-size SUVs. I'm very proud of the team for everything they've accomplished in the first quarter and what they're continuing to do, including strong pricing for every vehicle that we're able to produce, prioritizing production of higher demand vehicles, continuing to be very controlled on cost and being agile across the board. As Mary mentioned, the full year 2021 guidance we outlined last quarter and reiterated a couple of times remains intact. And we expect to be at the higher end of our EBIT-adjusted range. We expect Q2 to reflect the largest impact of the production disruptions resulting from the supply shortages. The retiming of vehicles we produce without certain modules and plant downtime in the second quarter is expected to be significantly higher than Q1, resulting in lower EBIT-adjusted quarter-over-quarter. Our current view is that our first half EBIT-adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. Recognizing the situation remains fluid, we're cautiously optimistic that our second half will be similar to or better than the first half. Importantly, our commitment to the acceleration of our EV product programs has not changed. Our important upcoming launches including our GMC Hummer EV super truck and Cadillac LYTIQ are on track and the construction in Lordstown, Factory ZERO, Springhill and CAM is progressing on schedule. We're still planning to invest nine to $10 billion of CapEx in 2021. Finally, our earnings power and cash generation potential remain robust. In a more normalized environment we expect that certain headwinds we're facing today will dissipate, but the strength of the underlying business powered by exceptional demand for our brands will remain. We expect that our normalized EBIT-adjusted performance will be strong as we continue producing and selling our in-demand and highly profitable full-size trucks and SUVs while continuing to launch new and exciting products and services that position GM to win in the future of mobility. So let's get into the strong results of the quarter in more detail. In Q1 we generated $32.5 billion in net revenue, $4.4 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 13.6% EBIT-adjusted margin and $2.25 in EPS diluted adjusted and minus $1.9 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. We exceeded expectations by driving strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions in our go-to-market strategies. Additionally, high used vehicle prices due to low new vehicle inventories in part drove record results at GM Financial. Our adjusted automotive free cash flow of minus $1.9 billion was lower $1 billion year-over-year primarily driven by the working capital impact from plant downtime and inventory carrying value of approximately $1.2 billion associated with vehicles built without certain modules due to the shortage of chips, which will reverse when those vehicles are completed partially offset by strong EBIT performance. We ended Q1 with a strong automotive cash balance of $19 billion and total automotive liquidity of more than $37 billion. So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q1, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $3.1 billion, up $900 million year-over-year and a 12.1% EBIT-adjusted margin driven by continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups in performance from the launch of our new all new full-size SUVs. Our average transaction prices were up 9% year-over-year for the quarter with full-size trucks up 10% and full-size SUVs up over 20%, helping to overcome headwinds from commodity inflation and lower volumes. These results speak to the strength of the consumer and the strong brand equity we have in our products, which we plan to leverage as we roll out our EV portfolio. On the cost side, we continue to leverage efficiencies executed during COVID, including opportunities directly related to third party services travel and all discretionary spend. Teams across the organization have also gone above and beyond to meet strong and rising demand where they can. To drive strong sales with lower inventory GM has introduced a new proprietary software application that helps dealers track vehicles from when they're completed at the plant to when they're released at their final destination. With many of our full-size trucks and SUVs being sold prior to arriving at the dealer or within days of hitting the lot, this software called Vin View, allows dealers to both track vehicles and provide an informed estimated delivery time enhancing the customer's arrival confidence and experience. Additionally, we also have a software application called focused ordering that includes a dashboard, which combines vehicle trim options with market data to help dealers ensure they're ordering the most in-demand products to meet customer preferences. This has been a huge help in our prioritization efforts. For example of all the 2021 light-duty crew cab sales in the first quarter, about 60% were based on this focused ordering dashboard. And these models are turning five and a half days faster than non-focused orders. In addition to these near-term benefits, we expect this technology to drive long-term cost efficiencies and lower inventories within the dealer network. And we still have a lot of excitement ahead of us this year as we complete renovation of Factory ZERO to launch the GMC Hummer EV super truck this fall. Factory ZERO will also build the GMC Hummer EV SUV, and the Chevy Silverado full-size electric pickup, which is the first of many high volume EV entries to come. And it will be the home of the Cruise origin a purpose built all electric and shared self-driving vehicle. And also as Mary announced our second battery plant recently in the last 18 months, which is a great indicator of our acceleration. Combined, these plants will have a capacity of over 70 gigawatt hours of production, and there are more being planned. We'll make additional cell capacity announcements as we progress in our product rollout. Let's move to GM International. We continue to be encouraged by our progress in GMI with first quarter EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, up $900 million year-over-year as we move past the initial effect of the pandemic in China. We also experienced positive price and mixed benefits as well as benefits from our structural cost actions across the segment. We delivered $300 million of equity income in China in Q1 due to higher volumes, stabilization and pricing and continued cost actions. EBIT-adjusted in GMI excluding China was up $400 million year-over-year, the second consecutive profitable quarter as the semiconductor and commodities impact in the quarter was more than offset by the favorable pricing and mix. With continued semiconductor driven plant downtime and low inventory levels, we expect Q2 to be challenged, but these results underscore the improvements in the region. A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and Corp segment, GM Financial has provided a significant offset to some of the semiconductor headwinds. Strong used vehicle prices combined with consumer credit strength helped to drive Q1 EBT-adjusted of $1.2 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year. We received $600 million in dividends from GM Financial in Q1. And we anticipate dividends in 2021 from GMF will significantly exceed the 2020 dividend of $800 million, due in part to their expected upside in 2021. Cruise costs in the quarter were $200 million. And as Mary mentioned, Cruise continues to make great progress towards commercialization every day. Corp segment EBIT was $30 million in the quarter a better than historical quarterly run rate primarily due to mark-to-market gains in the period. Turning to our 2021 outlook for the calendar year, last quarter, we outline strong full year 2021 guidance of EBIT-adjusted in the $10 billion to $11 billion range, including an estimated net semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which is calculated by taking loss contribution margin offset by tactical efforts through costs, go-to-market actions and earnings growth at GM Financial. EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $4.50 to $5.25 and adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the $1 billion to $2 billion range including an estimated semiconductor impact of $1.5 billion to two and a half billion. Since we share guidance with you in February, the business has faced additional pressures due to semiconductor shortages, as well as commodity inflation. Even though the gross impact of these headwinds has increased, the Net impact remains the same as the company has identified additional mitigation initiatives, including pricing and mixed go-to-market strategies, growth at GM Financial, pull ahead of Oshawa full-size pickup production and other cost efficiencies. And what we've been able to prove in the fluid environment we're facing today is that we have the resiliency to flex to the challenges. In spite of the volatility and semiconductor availability, we're confident in achieving our full year 2021 outlook, including EBIT-adjusted at the higher end of $10 billion to $11 billion, with the expectation that first half EBIT-adjusted will be around $5.5 billion. We continue to expect EPS diluted adjusted of $4.50 and $5.25 and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1 billion to $2 billion. Our expectation is that Q2 will be the weakest quarter of the year as we increase plant downtime and continue to build vehicles without modules impacting Q2 EBIT-adjusted and working capital as we hold vehicles in inventory to wholesale later in the year once the semiconductors are received. We are managing the shortage through select plant downtime in the second quarter, which may extend into the second half. However we plan on operating through the traditional US summer shut down in early Q3 at select facilities. We do not believe this short-term semiconductor headwind will affect our long-term earnings power. And we remain committed to our growth initiatives in the EV acceleration we've previously communicated. In the medium to long-term, we are focused on working cooperatively with our supply base, and the semiconductor manufacturers to improve our line of sight on the full supply chain mapping and gain more control over the chip itself. We're working to proactively implement risk mitigation strategies that will help avoid future disruptions to the supply chain. And we've also learned a lot over the last year about our and our dealers' ability to manage lower inventory levels. We're taking these learnings to implement dealer efficiency tools to optimize inventory levels, and we are creating sales tools to allow for more online shopping and purchase options. Finally, I want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities. I mentioned that the top priority for us is to invest in both new and existing businesses, with more than half going to accelerate EV growth, as well as continue with strong ICE portfolio that funds our journey while maintaining our investment grade balance sheet. To summarize, we had a strong beginning to the year highlighting the strength of our underlying business. We have again demonstrated our strength, our flexible ability, our laser focus on execution, and our ability to manage through a significant disruption while still generating strong results. There are still big challenges ahead of us. But we have the team and expertise to navigate this while not losing sight of our vision. We will continue investing in exciting new growth opportunities including EVs, battery supply and technology and software solutions that will drive growth and desirable differentiated products and services for our customers. Despite the challenging environment, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in 2021. And I couldn't be more proud of the GM family. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. Mary Barra : Hi, Rod. Good morning. Rod Lache : I want to probe this semiconductor issue a little bit with you. So you're maintaining the full year, I suspect Q1 was better than you expected and that maybe this Renaissance fire is having a larger impact near-term than you anticipated. But maybe if you can help us a little bit with what's happening behind the scenes. Number one, what's embedded in the implied Q2 earnings? Are all the earnings essentially coming from China and maybe GMF near-term? Number two, I assume that the full year $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion impact from semi's that you talked about has a very large gross negative volume impact and some very large offsets, pricing and other things. Maybe you can provide some color on the gross effects? And then lastly, what gives you confidence in the recovery? Are you - can you maybe share a little bit on what you're seeing happening through the Tier 2 supply chain? Mary Barra : Hey, Rod, there's a lot in there. But I first start off by saying the team is working to get every chip we can and to look at how do we leverage. It maybe chips that we weren't planning to use and how do we leverage them, as well as simplifying some things. So it's a - it's really the ingenuity and creativity of the team that is allowing us to build. Yes, the Renaissance fire did have an impact. And the team goes to work and figures out how to offset or minimize it and that's what they're doing. So I think there was a lot of great problem solving that was done in Q1. We have said we think Q2 will be the weakest. And then we see recovery coming in Q3 and Q4. And that's based on all the work the team is doing working with suppliers, et cetera. So there's no - it's just chip by chip working the issues to find solutions. And that's what the team is so good at doing. And it remains very dynamic. So I think to look here today and try to quantify exactly what all the ins and outs are going to be for the rest of the year. I think it would that'd be data that has a pretty short shelf life. But I think what you can count on and what we see with all the work that's been done across the whole supply chain and engineering team is that we have confidence that we're going to be able to hit our guidance and that with everything we know today will be at the top end. Rod Lache : Could you at least maybe give us some color on the magnitude of the volume loss that you're currently embedding in this full year forecast? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Rod, this is Paul. Yeah, I think the challenge with the volumes is that - as we said repeatedly, this is a really fluid situation. I mean, it quite literally changes day to day. So I think the commentary that we've given that, no doubt this situation has somewhat worsened in the short-term since the first quarter. We're constantly flexing. So some days, it gets a little better, some days, it gets a little bit worse. And what we're trying to do is just kind of reorient everybody around this. This semiconductor challenge was baked into our full year expectations. Certainly the timing is somewhat fluid and you see that. The fact that the first quarter has blown out expectations and 2Q is under consensus. But if you actually look at the first half, when you add Q1 and Q2 together, it's actually exceeding where street consensus was for the first half of the year. So I think we're pleased with the way that we're managing through this. And we want to try to keep it to the big picture because we can really get lost in the details on how fluid the situation is. Rod Lache : Yeah, understood and just lastly, very nice to see the international operation ex China approaching breakeven. And I assume a lot of that is related to some of the things that you've talked about before in South America, the actions you've been taking. What's the strategy longer term for that region? And do you think that that fits into the long-term, zero emission future that you described? Mary Barra : So Rod, I am really proud of the GMI team ex China, part of the China team as well. But that team that's really focused on those countries and the great progress they've been making. When we specifically talk about South America, we have strong brands and a strong dealer network and leading products in the in the market. And the team has continued to work on reducing costs and managing the business in a way that has allowed us to achieve those results in Q4 and Q1. That region will be impacted by Q2, which we've indicated overall will be weaker. But again, that's a - it's a temporary thing. And we're continuing to work all aspects because that region, we've got to get to earnings cost of capital. And that's the journey that we're on and we'll continue. Rod Lache : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Mary Barra : Good morning, Itay Michaeli : Maybe to start first just a couple financial questions, Paul, any thought to where US dealer inventory could end the year? And with the new tools that you've implemented for ordering, any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about running dealer inventory, let's say over the next couple of years? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. And good morning Itay, thanks for the question. I think - I don't think anybody would say that dealer inventory levels are optimized right now just drive by some lots and you see empty lots. It certainly means that that we're operating much, much lower than what I think - we even think is optimal. But as we mentioned in the comments, there's a lot of tools that we're learning how to operate at these lean levels that I think will provide some long-term efficiencies. And the dealer network has done really an amazing job of not only working with us, but also providing an environment for the customer that where the vehicle may not be immediately available, they give them reassurance to help drive that purchase transaction versus the customer being disappointed that the vehicle that he or she doesn't want isn't there on the lot. So that visibility, I think, undoubtedly will help us over the long-term. And we're taking those lessons and we're figuring out how to make sure that we manage that as efficiently as we can. But we certainly came into the year expecting to build inventories out of - coming out of the COVID situation. That clearly is challenged amid some of the production issues that we've seen with the semiconductor shortage. But we certainly hope to build as we get into perhaps late 2021 into 2022, to start getting inventory levels at what we think is a is a much safer value to have vehicles on the lots where customers want to purchase them. Itay Michaeli : That's helpful. I appreciate the detail, Paul. Then maybe just one strategic question actually on AV, of the 27 billion of spend on EV and AV can you maybe dimension how much of it is going towards the AV side? And how much of that may be is outside of Cruise? I'm trying to get out is sort of, maybe you can give us a bit of a sense of your vision for autonomy on the GM consumer vehicles whether Cruise may or may not play a role within that and kind of how you see that developing over the next several years as part of the objectives of the company. Mary Barra : Sure. Well, our focus at Cruise is to get creative technology that's safer than a human driver and deploy in our first market from a commercialization perspective, and then we'll continue to expand that into other cities and really excited with the progress they're showing in San Francisco, obviously, Dubai is very significant as well. So you take that and I've always said, we have kind of a revolutionary and an evolutionary strategy around driver assistance all the way to full level four and level five autonomy. So you see crews really focused on that full autonomy, but Super Cruise, we continue to add more and more features. And we've said that we envisioned that to get 95%, of being able to handle all solutions. Later in the decade, I believe and there's a lot to still unfold, but I believe we'll have personal autonomous vehicles, and then that will leverage the capability we have at Cruise, with the capability that we have at the car company, to really be well positioned to delight the customers from that perspective. So both paths are very important because the technology we put on vehicles today, I think makes them safer and delights the customers and is going to give us an opportunity for subscription revenue. And then the ultimate work that we're doing our Cruise, I think that is fully autonomous. Really opens up more possibilities and I think we can outline to that. Itay Michaeli : That's all very helpful. Thanks so much. Mary Barra : Thank you. Itay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good morning, everybody. Mary Barra : Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : First, a financial question, so Paul, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about sequential factors of profitability comparing first half to second half. So you're calling for similar levels of profitability at 5.5 billion each. But obviously, in the first half, you started out very strong in the first quarter and a lot of the headwinds in the second quarter are somewhat unusual and likely to repeat. So there's obviously some offset for the raw materials and cost and pricing. But just could you sort of talk about these various factors? Paul Jacobson : Yeah, thanks Emmanuel for that question. It's obviously a challenging environment to be able to be thinking about longer term, even six months, nine months ahead as we are navigating through this. So I think what we see is well, I would say cautious optimism. So while we talk about the second half of the year being similar or potentially slightly better than the first half, there's some caution in that. So for example things like the used car vehicle prices that GM Financial is clearly benefiting from that's likely to stay in place as long as new car inventories remain low. So that's an example of I would say that a variable that's sort of hedged directly against the challenges of the semiconductor. But as more vehicles come online, and I think most industrial forecasts are that chip availability is going to be better in the second half than it is in the first half. And I think we think that's true as well. That could lead to pricing that maybe isn't as strong as it was in the first quarter. So I think we're trying to maintain some caution and some rationality. The reality is we're - we and others are right in the middle of this, I think we're doing a really good job of managing through it as evidenced by the first quarter. And the fact that the first half of the year is coming in above consensus estimates before we announced. That - it's trying to provide a mix of reassurance in the projections that we've given, as well as some cautious optimism about what the future holds. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, and if I could just follow up quickly on this one. Are you able to dimension at all some of these more discrete buckets? So for example, raw materials, how much larger of a headwind could it be in the second half versus the first half? And then I also noticed in your first quarter cost walk, you're talking about higher engineering costs for EVs in particular. How should we think about that over the rest of the year? Paul Jacobson : Well clearly on the second part of that question first, you're going to continue to see engineering expenses pivoting into EVs. And I think as we continue to lean in and accelerate some of those vehicle programs, we are we are investing resources to be able to do that. So the first part of your question clearly commodity inflations had a massive impact. You just need to look at some of the indices to be able to see that, but we're not really isolating that because we're taking all of the cost pressures that we've seen both from our initial expectations and what's constantly changing and putting that all into the same bucket. So much the same way that the semiconductor issue is fluid in day to day, so are the commodity prices going forward? So while we have a little bit of forward purchasing going on, obviously, in the supply chain there's some exposure out there, but there's also some potential goodness if prices normalize. So we're trying to keep all of that very, very fluid as we manage it in the aggregate, both in terms of go-to-market strategies, as well as production prioritization. Emmanuel Rosner : Great and then my second question on electric vehicles, so your Silverado electric vehicle was confirmed officially in April, I think you said it will be your first high volume EV towards several high volume models by 2023. I'm curious if you could dimension for us how much of a contribution will the Silverado be towards your mid-decade goal of a million plus units by 2025? Or may be expressed differently, what kind of take rates you expect on pickups for EV powertrain, I guess in the relatively near to mid-term? Mary Barra : Well, I think we see it as a huge opportunity. I mean, we've gotten really strong response from commercial and government orders as a lot of fleet customers are looking to have zero emission vehicles. And again, we have incredible know how in this company and how to do full-size trucks, and we're taking that into an EV propelled vehicle. And that I think is going to give us some winning formula. I'm excited to share that vehicle with everyone because it's just stunning. So I think we're going to see strong demand there along with some other products be an important part of getting to our goals to have North America leadership. And I would say it's one of a few or several getting into the high volume segments that obviously we need to do and GM is well positioned to do building on the Ultium platform to achieve that leadership. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Mary Barra : Hi, John. John Murphy : Good morning. Good morning, everybody. Hi, Mary. So I just want to get back into this question of the inventory being too tight or light. And I mean, you just put up a record quarter and you're telling us that the inventory is not optimal and it's too light. I mean, would you argue that record profits indicates that you're in an optimal inventory? I mean, the industry is gone through this. And we've been covering this for a few decades now, where the inventory has been out of whack and too high. And now, suddenly, it's supposedly too tight. And we're seeing record profits put up. I mean, is it really too tight? And what do you mean by like, going back to something this is more normal. I mean, if I look at the last three quarters, I mean, I think the inventory was 492,000 in the third quarter of last year and now you're at 335. So is it somewhere in that zip code? Because I mean, you just put up the best three quarter stretch I think GM has had in history with this inventory that's not optimal or too tight. It just seems like you shouldn't change that much. What do you mean by growing the inventory? Mary Barra : So John, I think you're right, that will never go back to that levels of inventories that we held post our pre-pandemic because we've learned we can be much more efficient, getting the right models to the right dealers at leveraging and not having as much on the lot. But there are still customers who want to walk into a dealership and walk out or drive off the dealership with a brand new vehicle and we've got to be responsive to those customers as well. So I think it's going to end up being a little higher, especially when you look at our dealer network. I've got them sending me pictures of they have virtually nothing on the lot. So there's an optimal level, significantly lower than it was in the past, but higher than it is now. I think what you're seeing now, though, is the ingenuity of our dealers and the new tools we provided that give them insight into what's coming, and they're selling deep not only into the inventory, but deep into the pipeline of vehicles that are on the way. So I credit the - just how dedicated this team is of satisfying every customer. But I think there's an optimal level that's a little higher than we have right now. John Murphy : Yeah, I just think you're being sort of too apologetic. And the ingenuity you're forcing on the whole chain is actually driving a better outcome you've ever had before. And it just seems like you're doing in some ways, you've reinforced, the value chain is being forced in doing the right thing. And you're that ingenuity should continue. And it sounds like you're keeping that up. But I mean, I just think rebuilding the inventory too much might be not exactly the right answer. Mary Barra : So John just to be clear, we won't over build inventory to be crystal clear. And we will keep the ingenuity, the tools - I mean because it's better for everybody. It's better for the car company, it's better for the dealer. John Murphy : Absolutely. Yeah. I mean it's just a much better outcome right now. Second question, Mary, you're talking about 30 new EVs by 2025. Globally, two thirds of those will be in North America. So horseshoes and hand grenades by my dumb guys map that's about 20, maybe a little bit more. What ICE vehicles are still going to be launched between now and 2025? It seems like almost everything that would be launched in North America between now and 2025 would be EVs that you're saying right here. Are there any ICE vehicles that are notable that we should think about between now and then? Mary Barra : Well, John, I'm not going to give you the full product cadence between now and '25. I'm sure you went along with everyone on the call. But there's some important products coming as we look at making sure on our franchise products that we are leading from an industry perspective and continuing to delight those customers. But what I will say is, I think what's important with the investments that we've made over the last five to seven years with new platforms from an ICE perspective, whether it's small, mid, and then full-size trucks, SUVs we don't have to make huge investments in architectures, it's mainly making sure those products are going to win in the marketplace from a customer facing perspective. And that's where we'll be focused on between now - frankly, now and 2035, when our aspiration is to sell all EVs from a light duty perspective. John Murphy : Okay, that's helpful. And then just last scenario, on Slide 7, you went from OPM Bright Drop Cruise, charging infrastructure, a bunch of other stuff. There's nothing in there when you're talking about it seems like fluff at all, and all seems very, very real. How do you keep track of like the capital invested, the returns and the profits on all of these new growth initiatives? Because like you said, nothing seems like fluff, it all seems very real. It's not just any PowerPoint stuff, you guys are throwing up. How do you keep track of that? And then maybe sort of the follow on to that, when you think about Dubai, and 4000 cruise origins floating around, I don't know if you can even sketch the economics for us of what that means. I mean, I would guess that's a few 100 million dollars of EBIT that would be sticky and not volatile, like the rest of - or not a lot more or less volatile than the rest of the company. But I mean, how are you keeping track of all this stuff? How are things measured and then maybe some idea of what the Dubai economics look like? Mary Barra : Well, we have a really good CFO. And I mean that in all seriousness John, because you're right, and you look at Page 7 or you look at Page 6, but you look at everything in our deck, they are all real. And we have a long-term plan and a short-term plan, and everyone has to earn its place to get whether it's engineering, IT or capital allocated to it. So we have a very rigorous process. So rest assured that this is not PowerPoint, these are real initiatives that are being executed on an accelerated fashion. As it relates to Dubai, I mean, I think it highlights the fact that as we grow, not only in Dubai, but in other cities across the United States, across North America and across the world, we're uniquely positioned in the AV space, because we have the ability to produce those vehicles, I mean, we're already tooling up the origin to be produced at Factory ZERO. So that's a huge opportunity for us and to your point, that's going to drive to the bottom line. So I'm very excited about the future growth opportunities that we have with Cruise, what the production of the vehicles will do for that. But then with all these additional, whether they're going into other markets, like we can leverage with Ultium, expanding in a market we don't really operate that much in right now from a commercial vehicle perspective, with EVs, with Bright Drop and beyond with things like OnStar Insurance and subscriptions for things like Super Cruise. So that's why I'm so confident of our growth capability. Paul Jacobson : John, off the record, I agree with everything Mary said except this point on the CFO. John Murphy : She's just saying that because you're there, Paul. I'm just kidding. Paul Jacobson : Clearly. John Murphy : The - on Dubai, I mean, there are other cities that have like city NV here that Dubai is obviously a great sort of crown jewel to come out there with this. I mean, Mary do you have other cities engaging or reaching out to it? Because I mean, it just, it just seems like that's something that everybody - New York and San Fran, everybody's going to be like, hey, what Dubai is doing in a week, we have to do it, too. I mean, are there other indications of interest that are popping up? Mary Barra : Yeah, I'm not going to get specific, but there definitely is interest in other parts of the world. And I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in the United States alone. John Murphy : Okay. All right. Thank you very much, guys. Mary Barra : Thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Paul. I fully appreciate and you said this timing is difficult given everything going on in the industry, but you did say the first quarter came in better. So I guess the implication is that very little of that semi-impact that you call that for the year happened in first quarter, and then you've always called second quarter worse, but it does seem like maybe it's a little bit worse than a few months ago. So at least that's the impression I got. And since you didn't give more clear color on implied second quarter, I think what would really help investors here is if you could compare that second quarter production maybe versus expectations at the beginning of the year? And as we go forward for the rest of the year, you mentioned GMF is better. We saw that in the guidance, but what - and you mentioned pricing, but what are you I guess specifically assuming? Or how are you thinking about modeling pricing to offset things like higher commodities? Paul Jacobson : So thanks for that question, Joe. I think I'd go back to the fact that this is obviously a very dynamic situation. I would say in all honesty that Q2 is probably worse than we expected, it was going to be a few months ago. But that's due in part to some of the timing of how we map this out. So what I would say is that we are carefully evaluating the short-term supply chain, the intermediate term supply chain, and some of the longer-term issues as well. So depending on the confidence of where we see chips coming in and which chips and our ability to reallocate those and reprioritize those. We did see an opportunity to accelerate some production into Q1 to take advantage of the market that we see right now, which is obviously very, very strong and the confidence to be able to make up some of that volume in Q2. So that's why I think we need to be really cautious as we're thinking about the full year. What gives us the confidence is the agility that the team has displayed and being able to respond to this and, how dynamic it really is. So part of the reason we don't want to anchor in on production volumes and so on is it just because that's going to change, it's going to change next week, it's going to change the week after, sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. So it's really trying to operate in at this level of where we need to take go-to-market strategies, where we need to prioritize mix, where we need to accelerate or potentially shut down a plant in anticipation of some challenges that are coming up over the short to medium term, then that's kind of what we're doing. You saw that going into plant downtime in Q1. So I wouldn't say that Q1 was immune from the semiconductor challenges. I think, certainly the consumer has proven to be very robust. Used car values continue to go up, which I think is endemic of the inventory challenges that we see across the board and that everybody sees. So all of that is just is working in concert, into what I would say is a very agile plan for us to meet our objectives. It's also why we were trying to steer this to the first half versus Q1 and Q2. So there isn't a - there isn't necessarily a read through in the short-term because something that happens in March versus something that happens in April isn't really all that relevant to how we're thinking about managing through this. And that's why when we have the confidence of looking at where first half expectations were, despite the disparity between Q1 and Q2, we actually think that we're performing ahead of expectations that were outlined at the beginning of the year. We just want to be cautious about that in the back half. That makes sense. Joseph Spak : Yeah, no doubt, but so is it fair to assume that embedded within that the second half versus first half pricing does take stuff down? Paul Jacobson : No, I don't necessarily think that's the case. I think the environment is what it is. And that's kind of what puts us in that 5.5 billion ish type EBIT-adjusted for the first half of the year. But the environment has remained strong. In some cases, it's gotten even stronger through the year. So we're meant to capitalize on that wherever we can. But I don't see in our second quarter, any sort of immediate changes to the pricing environment that we've seen today. Joseph Spak : Okay. And Mary, you mentioned the relationship with Honda on purchasing R&D and connected services again. That MLU was announced, I think, like eight months ago, any indication now like what type of savings you can expect from that to deliver over time? Mary Barra : We're not going to frame that right now. I will tell you it's a very productive relationship and partnership and we continue to work so as we identify and want to frame those opportunities. There's more, there's more to come, but nothing to share today. Joseph Spak : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Hey, Everybody. Hi, Mary. Hey, Paul. So for every adoption there is a de-adoption. And there seems to be clearly this war against ICE waged by governments, by consumers, regulators, right and then lately OEMs waging their own war against ICE. And when I talk to car companies and management teams like you on the topic of potential write downs or impairments, I asked that because many of these investments of course that you've made in ICE go a decade or more, 15 maybe even close to 20 years for in some instances. And so I - maybe it's too soon, but I'd love to get your view on when along this journey away from ice would it be appropriate as you sit down with your auditors to think about curtailment of useful life and that impact the financial impact? Because it could really change your results and I think it's pretty relevant. If I'm wrong, tell me how I'm wrong because I'm scratching my head thinking, how do you avoid at some point is it just you're making too much damn money selling an ICE stuff right now. And it's just that the fit isn't right. And we need to wait for things to get worse. Help me out there on the impairment potential over time. I'm not asking - it's not a 2021 issue, but as we look out. Mary Barra : So Adam, a couple things, when you said for every EV adoption there's a de-adoption. For General Motors, I think this is a growth opportunity for us. Because there's a lot of EV interest on the coast, that's where we don't get what I would call our fair share. And frankly, I'm going after more than our fair share on the strength of our product portfolio. So that's point one, we see this as a growth opportunity, not only in the US and markets we're in, but in growing into other markets we're currently not participating in. I would also say with the assets that we have right now, when you look at converting a plant from a plant that builds ICE vehicles to those that produce electric vehicles, there's a lot of reuse. Body shop structures or machinery and equipment, the paint shop, which is a 30-to-35-year asset, doesn't care if it's paint, what the propulsion system is in the vehicle that we're going to be painting. And so there's a lot of capital that can be reused as we go forward. I would also say with every new internal combustion engine propelled vehicle that we put out; we're looking to make it better for the environment from a fuel economy emissions CO2 perspective. And I also think you have to look at the fact that right now, battery costs are coming down. But look at what's in the marketplace right now. I think we're really one of the only people that have an all electric vehicle that's as affordable as the Bolt EV, we've got to make sure as we move to an all electric future that it truly is for everyone. So that's more than an advertising tagline. That's something that General Motors is very much committed to making sure everybody - because ESG has an S in the middle of it, which is making sure we're doing the right thing for everyone. So I think we're moving at a very quick speed to be able to provide EVs for everyone. I think it's going to be a growth opportunity for General Motors. And I think a lot of the assets that we currently have can be reused in an all EV world. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary, I have a very quick follow up, and then we're going to - I'll shut up on Super Cruise. I see on Slide 8, you had talked about it being available on 22 models in a couple of years. Can you tell us what is the attach rate of Super Cruise on the models were available? I think that's probably a more relevant metric. And maybe where that was a year ago. So we can get some sense of the attach rate and the growth penetration year-on-year because this is emerging as really, I think potentially a very, very interesting part of the story. And a little extra transparency there I think will go a long way. Thanks. Mary Barra : Yeah. So Adam, on that I get your point. And I think it's a good question. I think when you look at - the customer - customers who have experienced Super Cruise love it. You've heard the 85% say they either wouldn't buy a vehicle without it or they'd strongly desire it to be on their next vehicle. But in that move to have 22 models by 2023, we're in the very early ramp because it's going to happen quickly. And so the Bolt EV, the Cadillac Escalade. So I think we'll have more to share with you as we go forward. But again, this is one of these technologies that you have to experience it just to understand how phenomenal that it is. And that's why I think having the ability to do it in a subscription model as opposed to having to make the decision on day one, I think is going to be very, very important. So we can be transparent and share more of that information as we go forward. It's a little early right now with the ramp up that we have. Adam Jonas : Alright Mary thanks. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi thanks for taking my question, which is also on Super Cruise. Are you able to describe in more detail the driver attention system on Super Cruise? What steps have you taken to ensure that drivers remain engaged and always keep their eyes on the road, either in terms of educating the consumer about the capabilities and limitations of the system, or putting in place different technological safeguards, including I'm not sure any measures to prevent consumers from attempting to override your safeguards. Mary Barra : So we're very dedicated to this. And the team has worked really hard on this technology, but we're literally watching to make sure that the driver is paying attention to the road. And if the system sees that you're not, it indicates and it kind of is reminding you to pay attention to pay attention. And if you continue to not pay attention, it shuts down. And so I think it's - that I think one of the reasons it's been recognized as a leading driver assist technology. So I think the best thing to do is get you into a vehicle seat and experience it, because it's quite effective. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful and lastly, as a follow up, I see on Slide 21, that you will provide additional insight into software and services at the event later this year. Are you able to maybe share at a high level now how you're sort of thinking about the potential materiality over time of after sales software and services, including subscription services, such as Super Cruise? And I know OnStar is very strong in China, do you offer or plan to offer Super Cruise outside North America such as in China? Mary Barra : Well, we're looking at - we actually already have and looking at how do we continue to expand that in China. But I would say overall, I don't want to get ahead of myself for what we're going to share on our Investor Day later this year. But I will tell you, it's significant when you look at - OnStar is already fairly significant. The after-sell opportunity OnStar Insurance - new features that we'll be offering that can be subscription based. And we have a whole team at General Motors working on leveraging the strength that we have of the OnStar platform in the vehicle and how we can leverage that, especially with the vehicle intelligence platform as well. So I'm excited to share that story as we come out. And I think we're at the beginning of significant opportunity in that space, so more to come. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra, for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Well, I want to thank everybody for joining. I couldn't be more pleased with everything that has been accomplished in the first quarter with a lot of headwinds coming at us with the semiconductor challenges and then some of the other natural disasters that impacted the supply chain. But I think it just shows the ingenuity and the creativity and the dedication of our team to find solutions and to work to optimize or mitigate to the extent we can. At the same time the team was doing that we also made significant progress in our transformation from an electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle perspective and some of the new growth opportunities when you look at Bright Drop and OnStar Insurance. So the team has really been working on two fronts a very strategic front while dealing with some of the tactical challenges. And I think we ought to remember is the challenges we have with semiconductors right now are a temporary situation. We will work through that and move beyond it. And it's not impacting our transformation and growth strategies. I I'd also just like to say that, please take a look at the sustainability report that we announced just a little over a week ago. In it, it outlines very clearly our goals and objectives. And we're tried to be transparent and we will provide updates and hold ourselves accountable to the targets and the plans that we've outlined. So again, really appreciate the opportunity to share all the progress at General Motors with you today. I look forward to being able to see everyone in person later in the year when we have our Investor Day. So thanks everyone. Paul Jacobson : Thanks everyone. Operator : That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Wednesday, August 4, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Tabitha. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2021. Our press release was issued this morning, and the conference call materials are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined here today by Mary Barra, GM's Chairman and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's CFO; and Dan Berce, President of GM Financial.  As usual, before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And now I will turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rocky, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Today, Paul and I will provide some insights into our record results and then talk about our outlook for the second half. As we announced earlier, we achieved EBIT adjusted of $4.1 billion in the second quarter and $8.5 billion in the first half, including charges for recalls, primarily the Bolt EV. I really want to thank our employees and the extended GM team, including our suppliers and our dealers, for helping us deliver such consistently strong results. Everyone continues to demonstrate remarkable resiliency and adaptability in a rapidly changing environment.  In addition, our ROIC adjusted of 27.3% in the quarter significantly exceeded our target. This underlines how our strong returns enable us to reinvest in the future of this business. The reinvestment includes accelerated investments in our electric and autonomous strategy to build a future that is better for our customers and better for the environment, and we'll discuss this a bit more in a few minutes.  All-electric is an important point of distinction. Because of the performance, range, flexibility and scalability of our Ultium and Hydrotec platforms, including the work we're doing to continually drive cost reduction, we don't need to depend on partial solutions like hybrids and electrified ICE vehicles. Instead, we're primarily focused on investments that achieve the end solution of zero emissions more quickly.  Before we move on, I will share my perspective on our recall of the 2017 to '19 model year Bolt EVs and then the status of the semiconductor situation. So let's start with the Bolt. Across the company, we have made both product and workplace safety everyone's responsibility. Our focus is on prevention but also moving with a sense of urgency when problems do arise. When we learned of a potential of 2 new battery fires that were part of our previous recall population, we acted quickly.  We did an investigation and our engineering analysis identified 2 rare manufacturing defects in some cells manufactured by our supplier in the '17 to '19 time frame, so we instituted a second recall with the overriding priority of doing the right thing. Because cells for 2020 and later vehicles were built using improved manufacturing processes, the recall does not impact newer Bolt EVs or EUVs. And since that recall, we have worked with our supplier and partner to make further process improvements.  Just as important, the recall doesn't impact the Ultium platform. It is a different battery system, and our joint venture plants that manufacture Ultium cells will follow rigorous GM quality processes.  As for semiconductors, the situation does remain fluid, and the supply chain continues to be impacted by events like what is happening right now with the COVID spike in Malaysia. While we informed our employees yesterday that some truck production will be impacted next week, even as we resume production at some crossover plants, we remain confident in our team's ability to continue to find creative solutions that minimize the impact on our highest-demand and capacity-constrained vehicles, including full-size trucks and SUVs.  We are raising our guidance for full year EBIT-adjusted to $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion. And we are being cautious because of the uncertainty due to the Delta variant and its potential impact on the supply chain. But we do believe that the combination of our safety protocols and the rising vaccination rates will help minimize disruptions, but we do have to note the situation does remain fluid.  We are also putting long-term solutions in place to derisk our supply chain. This includes collaborating with semiconductor manufacturers and continuing to enhance transparency throughout the entire semiconductor supply chain. So now let's turn to growth. As I mentioned in my letter to shareholders, we are addressing the entire ecosystem to speed EV adoption and commercialization of self-driving technology at scale. We will offer a full range of vehicles and services that make EVs accessible to the largest possible customer base. We'll also create job opportunities for thousands of employees in our Ultium Cells joint venture. In addition, we will work to grow our businesses like BrightDrop, OnStar Insurance and other software and services, including subscriptions.  The Cruise model for autonomous rideshare is another great example of an inclusive solution because it will make all-electric transportation more accessible and affordable. Delivering on our EV all-electric future requires a value change that is secure, sustainable, scalable and cost competitive. To do this, we are creating a diversified value chain of environmentally friendly and geographically diverse footprints through investments, strategic partnerships and supply agreements.  For example, we are working with suppliers to develop new sources in the United States for lithium, a key battery cell component, and accelerate the adoption of extraction methods which have less of an impact on the environment. We're taking a similar approach across other critical minerals needed to support our EV future. And we're confident that our strategy will secure our supply in a sustainable way as we accelerate our transition to EVs.  We'll share more about these key topics and others, including battery cost and business opportunities that we're creating with software, at our investor event on October 6 and 7, which we hope will be in person because we are so looking forward to having you experience technologies like Watts to Freedom in the GMC HUMMER EV pickup, as well as Super Cruise, which we are constantly advancing its capabilities. Just last month, for example, we demonstrated the latest version of Super Cruise technology that will be featured on the Sierra 1500 Denali late in the 2022 model year. It will include the ability to trailer while driving hands-free. We will also update you on Cruise, which continues to make excellent progress towards launching its first fully driverless commercial service. GM remains a major accelerator of Cruise's mission with the purpose-built origin, giving Cruise a huge competitive advantage.  I also want to take a moment to share some new insights into our plan to launch more than 30 EVs globally by 2025 and become the EV market leader in North America. As we recently announced, because we are increasing our 2020 to 2025 capital and engineering investment from $27 billion to $35 billion, we will add 2 new vehicles to our commercial portfolio. The first is a full-sized battery electric cargo van for Chevrolet, which will exceed the expectations of small business owners, tradespeople and anyone else who has been well served by the Chevrolet Express. The second is a medium-duty truck that will put both Ultium and our Hydrotec hydrogen fuel cell technology to work, powering service and utility vehicles such as school buses, bucket trucks, wreckers and more. Both will complement BrightDrop and keep our commercial fleet market share growing, and we'll share more details about these products as we move forward.  Now if you step back for a moment and think about what this means for the future of work and the greenhouse gas reduction from surface transportation, because when you say between these new trucks, BrightDrop, EV pickups coming from Chevrolet and GMC and our work with Wabtec on locomotives and Navistar on semi trucks, we will have electric solutions for almost any towing or hauling jobs you can imagine.  Hydrotec is a very important part of the equation because it expands our reach into additional growth markets. We're already at work on our first production fuel cells leveraging innovative manufacturing processes that can unlock economies of scale and reduce overall costs. This technology, along with our 4 U.S. battery plants that we have announced and the full portfolio of EVs we are planning, in addition to the customer experience we're creating, underscore once again how determined we are to lead.  The determination reaches through the entire company. And when I meet with our employees, they tell me how incredibly excited they are to be part of a once-in-a-generation transformation that will truly change the world. Their tenacity and collective commitment to our vision are why we are delivering such strong business results and advancing our future so quickly. So now for a closer look at our results and the outlook, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Mary, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. We've just experienced another very exciting quarter for the company with robust financial performance, and we're taking advantage of opportunities to accelerate our growth strategy with the additional investments we announced in EV and AV technology, that which Mary just outlined.  During the quarter, we announced expectations of first half EBIT adjusted in the $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion range, which we achieved despite an $800 million charge related to the Bolt EV recall and $400 million primarily related to the side airbag recall late in the quarter, which were not included in our first half guidance range. I'll get into the details of these results in a minute, but first, really wanted to highlight the overall strength in the business driven by the incredible demand environment for our new end-use vehicles, allowing us to deliver results that are better all-in than we expected coming into the year.  For instance, we saw an increase in our vehicle production in May and June versus what was projected on our earnings call in early May, and we were able to pull ahead some chip availability into Q2 from Q3. This has all led to the significantly improved performance in the first half of the year. We are seeing new challenges in the third quarter due to global COVID outbreaks, including the current outbreak in Malaysia resulting in closures of assembly, test and packaging facilities for semiconductors. This remains, as we said, a fluid and rapidly changing environment. Given our first half performance and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are raising our full year EBIT-adjusted guidance to an expected range of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion from the $10 billion to $11 billion previous range. While raw materials continue to be a significant year-over-year headwind as platinum group metals and steel prices have continued to increase this year, we have been mitigating the impact by managing several other factors, including pricing and mix, go-to-market strategies, record profits at GM Financial and other cost efficiencies.  We are providing a wider guidance range than typical, given the fluid semiconductor situation and expect our variability within the range to be primarily driven by production volumes.  So let's get into the strong results of the quarter in more detail. In Q2, we generated $34.2 billion in net revenue, $4.1 billion in EBIT adjusted, 12% EBIT-adjusted margin, $1.97 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.5 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. We exceeded expectations by driving strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy. Additionally, high used vehicle prices drove continued record results at GM Financial.  So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q2, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.9 billion against the backdrop of strong pricing on our full-size pickups and continued performance from the launch of our all-new full-size SUVs, partially offset by warranty charges in material and commodity costs. We generated a 10.4% EBIT-adjusted margin in the region. Our strong average transaction prices, up over 14% year-over-year, speak to the high demand for our full-size trucks and SUVs. A big contributor to this increase is the demand for premium trims, our platinum sport and premium luxury trims on Escalades doubled. And on Yukon, our Denali and AT4 represent more than 2/3 of all Yukon sales.  Our volume has been constrained by very tight inventories, which we believe is having a temporary impact on market share in the region. We ended the quarter with approximately 212,000 units in dealer inventory. We expect continued high demand in the second half of this year, with continued low inventory into and through 2022.  Let's move to GM International. GMI EBIT adjusted was up $300 million year-over-year as we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment. Second quarter equity income in China was $300 million, driven also by strong mix, stabilization in pricing and material cost performance, more than offsetting headwinds due to the chip supply shortage and higher commodity costs. In addition, we received a $600 million dividend from our China automotive JVs in Q2. EBIT adjusted in GMI, excluding China, was up $200 million year-over-year as a result of favorable pricing and mix. The underlying strength of the GMI business continues to improve as the team drives pricing, mix and cost optimization. However, we do expect some challenges in the second half, primarily due to semiconductor-driven plant downtime.  Few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and our Corp segment. GM Financial has continued to deliver, with record Q2 EBT adjusted of $1.6 billion and is benefiting from both strong used vehicle prices and continued favorable consumer credit checks. We received $1.2 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date, and we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in 2021 as we benefit from their record earnings.  Cruise costs in the quarter were $300 million and Corp segment EBIT was a loss of $40 million, which was better than normal run rate due to mark-to-market gains on investments, partially offsetting costs.  Now let's turn to our 2021 second half outlook. When thinking about the second half of the year performance, there are some fundamental pressures versus what we've seen in the first half. We've seen commodity inflation continue to rise. And while it's come down off the peaks, we expect second half commodity expense to be $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher than the first half of the year.  At GM Financial, we expect second half headwinds of $1 billion to $1.5 billion versus the first half as we do not assume allowance adjustments experienced in the first half will repeat and we expect lower lease termination volume. Record high purchase rates are capping the gains at contract residual value and the start of credit normalization. We expect our growth initiative investments in the second half to increase by about $500 million. And the first half also contained $400 million in mark-to-market gains on equity investments that we do not assume will repeat. All of this adds up to about $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion of headwinds in the second half of the year.  In addition, we expect North American volumes to be approximately 100,000 units lower in the second half versus the first, including some impact from our full-size pickup truck and SUV plants, primarily as a result of some of the near-term pressures in Malaysia impacting plants across North America. Otherwise, we expect the robust demand and pricing environment to continue as we get into 2022.  From a full year perspective, we expect EPS diluted adjusted in the range of $5.40 to $6.40 and adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. This semiconductor shortage, as we said, remains fluid and the supply chain challenges continue in the second half of the year. Our guidance assumes no year-end work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without modules. Significant cash flows could shift from 2021 to 2022 if we have these work-in-process vehicles held at year-end. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range.  So in summary, we had a very strong first half of the year. I think it highlights the strength of our underlying business. We've again demonstrated our flexibility, our laser focus on execution and our ability to manage through a significant disruption while generating strong results, and we don't expect that to change. There are still some challenges ahead of us, but we have the team and expertise to navigate this while not losing sight of our vision.  We will continue investing in exciting new growth opportunities, including EVs, battery supply and technology and software solutions that will drive growth as well as desirable and differentiated products and services for our customers. We look forward to sharing more around these opportunities at our Investor Day on October 6 and 7. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Just want to get a little bit more into the second half and then also looking ahead to '22 in terms of how these could repeat. Maybe start with the decreased volume. Can you remind us of how much volume you lost in first half? And then what -- why the conservatism around second half? Paul Jacobson : So in the first half, our production was actually up year-over-year, which is not necessarily true of everyone. So I think we produced about 200,000 more vehicles in the first half of '21 than we did in '20. And that was, I think, really a function of how well the team performed. So to be essentially flat to that level, we don't see as a material downgrade to kind of the trends that we've seen in the business right now.  I think what you're hearing from us is sort of a very real acknowledgment of what we see out there with COVID. Now it may turn out to be less impactful than we think it is. But I think the approach that we've taken through this has been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter as we're cautious. We started pointing out some of the challenges that we were seeing in the forward supply chain in Malaysia really going back into late May, early June time frame, and unfortunately, just wasn't able to catch up on their vaccination rates, but they're making good progress. So we want to take a little bit of a cautious tone because we want to maintain credibility around these ranges. And if we see the environment improve, then I think we'll respond accordingly. Brian Johnson : Okay. And just a brief follow-on. How should we think about mix, especially in 3Q? We -- you have the downtime now at your 3 big pickup truck plants. That's a headwind. You're bringing on some of the more mid-range CUVs like the Equinox or, actually, when do those come online? And also kind of related to that, there's this whole issue of trucks in holding lots that are complete, semi-complete, so the suppliers would have booked, for example, their axles, but are not shipped. How are those going to enter into wholesale sales over the next quarter or 2? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Brian, I think if you look at our full-size truck production, we've actually been performing remarkably well. The shutdowns that were announced yesterday are really the first ones kind of the full -- first full ones that we've taken this year. So -- and it is somewhat short term that we see that. We're managing this week to week. I think the bulk of -- when we look at the bulk of the 100,000 units from first -- second half to first half is really in crossovers. We think truck production and full-size SUV are relatively stable over that time period. But again, we're going to continue to watch that.  The vehicles that are built without the modules, I think, present for us, as we've talked about before, a strong option for us. In fact, when we have downtime in the plants like we've announced, we're actually using some of that where we've got availability of the chips that were slated for production that can't be produced. We're redeploying those into some of those vehicles that have been produced earlier, allows us to maintain a little bit of the wholesaling momentum going forward. So we're going to continue to watch that, we're going to continue to do it. We're being careful to make sure that above all else, we're managing quality for the vehicles, and the manufacturing and engineering teams have really done an amazing job of managing through the logistical difficulties of doing it. But we continue to see that as a very useful tool for us to navigate this in the short run. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Wanted to just follow up on the comments on the second half guide and I guess the commentary on the volume piece around crossovers. So maybe you could just talk to expectations on price and mix versus the first half. Is it fair to assume that if your volume is actually coming down a bit and your inventory may even get tighter? Is there some incremental benefit on price and potential mix as well? Mary Barra : Well, I think there is. I mean, we think we'll continue to see strong price, and obviously, Paul referred to the strong mix that we have that's leading to these record ATPs. And I think it speaks to the demand for the products that we have, especially full-size trucks, full-size SUVs and, frankly, crossovers as well. So we think we're going to see a strong pricing environment continue throughout the rest of the year and into 2022. And so I think there's opportunities for both. Dan Levy : Okay, great. And then just a longer-term one, and this is more so on ICE versus EV profitability. I'm sure you'll give a little more at the Investor Day. But you're reducing your investment on ICE programs. The ICE demand is actually -- and profit is quite strong. So if ICE demand remains intact, can we actually see ICE profitability expand in the coming years as you reduce investment? And if that's the case, how do you mitigate that potential profit or margin dilution as you shift your mix from ICE to EV? Mary Barra : Well, I think we're very well positioned from an ICE portfolio because of the investments we made in new vehicle platforms, full-size trucks, mid-size crossovers, full-size SUVs, et cetera. So we're really well positioned with an ICE portfolio, which allows us to focus our investment on electric -- full electric products. And as we work to make that transition, yes, we see, at the early days, some pricing pressure due to battery costs, but that's why we're so aggressively taking battery -- working to take battery costs down with multiple technology road maps. You will hear us talk more about that when we're together in October. But then we also see, filling that gap will be the strong foundation that we have to build on as it relates to software and subscriptions. Now that we have our vehicle intelligent platform, which allows for full over-the-air updates and that we started launching that new VIP in 2019 with the CT4 and the CT5 and then the Corvette and it continues, that's going to give us a lot of opportunity for more software services that we can provide that customers value and, therefore, will pay for as well as subscriptions.  So if you think about it, I see the opportunity we have, and then I haven't even really talked about the growth opportunity we have with leveraging the Ultium platform, leveraging the Hydrotec platform as well as growing our commercial vehicle business and with BrightDrop in some of the vehicles that we talked about today. So there's tremendous growth opportunity that will, as we get battery costs down, will be sitting on top of the strong margins we have today.  So we see it, in the interim, kind of filling the hole, but we're working quickly and think we have a leadership position in battery cell cost. That's why we've announced the four plants. So I see a huge growth opportunity as we move through this transition. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Was hoping, just first, to clarify what's happening to profitability in North America. So if you could just bear with me. Your costs were up $3.9 billion year-over-year in the quarter. Sounds like there's a few unusual pieces there like the warranty, which you called out, and I appreciate you talking about that $1.2 billion. That wasn't in Street expectations. And I think you had about $1 billion year-over-year in Q2 from nonrecurrence of last year's austerity. So that means that there's probably $1.7 billion or so of commodities and other materials year-over-year. And everyone's experiencing that.  So my question is, do you think that, that means that actually that some of the -- a significant part of the pricing that we're seeing in the industry, we shouldn't think about that in isolation. We should think about that against the material and commodity because it's really just offsetting variable costs. And if so, just -- if you can just give us a sense of what you're kind of aiming for with regard to North American margins once the dust settles. Paul Jacobson : Yes, Rod, thanks for that. The -- I wouldn't attribute all -- you did a good breakdown of some of the cost inflation and the warranties and what we saw on the recalls. But I wouldn't attribute all the remaining to just inflation of the underlying materials because the other thing that's going on is we are producing a much richer mix with more options and features. So material costs are up, but those are positive margin-accretive sales, so we're actually encouraged by that going forward.  So there's no doubt we've had strong margin performance. And I think what you said, what we've tried to facilitate for the guidance that we put forward here is the underlying environment. I don't think we see any meaningful reasons to expect it to change in terms of the demand in the short run and even into 2022, where we continue to see depressed inventories. I think when the chip situation resolves itself, it's not going to probably be a massive sort of influx of manufacturing right out of the gate.  So we do see continued tight inventories going into 2022. So I think one of the cautions about the second half is to not read too much into it and extrapolate that as a 2022 performance. We'll give more guidance on 2022 as we get through the budget process and towards the end of the year with what we see. But there's nothing fundamentally different about demand that we see changing in the near term. Rod Lache : Okay. So just to clarify, do you believe that once the dust settles, a 10%-plus margin is sustainable in North America? And just secondly, just as we're thinking about that 2022, just starting from the midpoint of this year's guidance, you have $12.5 billion. It looks like if we just look at the commodity investment, GMF and mark-to-market delta that you laid out for the second half and offset that with the nonoccurrence of recalls, there's maybe a $2.5 billion drag into next year from those things.  Can you just be a little bit more specific on what the recovery in volume actually means? Because this year, you're only going to do about 2.5 million vehicles. Are we correct in assuming that a more normal run rate for you at this point is in the 3.1 million, 3.2 million unit range? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Well, for the avoidance of doubt, yes, we do think that North American margins can be above 10%, and that was what I was trying to get at in there. So I think you've attributed some of the headwinds, but like I said, we got to be cautious not to read into it. So for example, if you look at commodities, we saw some of the pressure in first half. The lion's share of it is hitting us in the second half, but commodity prices are down off their peaks. So while we'll see a little bit of pressure in the first half, if prices stay at these levels, we would actually expect a little bit of uplift as we go into the second half of '22. But there's a long time between here and there that we have to be cautious. And production will certainly be higher next year as we hope and expect that the chips will normalize.  But like we said, from the very beginning, we've approached this thing with caution because I can't tell you how fluid it has been as we manage week to week. But I think when you look at the underlying results and what we've been able to produce in the first half of the year, I think what you've got is a team that has executed incredibly well even versus some of our peers and competitors, and I don't expect that to change going forward. Rod Lache : Paul, I'm going to selfishly just sneak in another just clarification in here. As we think about 2022, we have to extrapolate something here. Should we be anticipating some kind of launch costs or additional spending and things like that as you start to approach the launch of some of these EVs? Paul Jacobson : Well, I mean, of course, we're going into sort of a heavy cycle of launches as we get to the more than 30 EVs by 2025, which really begins with the Hummer EV later this fall and as we go into the LYRIQ and various other launches. So there's certainly going to be some pressure from that, and we'll provide more details as we get into the 2022 plan. Rod Lache : Okay. But your 10% margin comment is taking that into consideration? Or how should we -- it's kind of an important question. How should we be thinking about that? Paul Jacobson : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Paul, maybe you could just help us out a little bit here because when you communicated to the market in, I think, mid-June, the $4 billion to $5 billion this quarter and then the $2 billion to $3 billion headwind in the second half versus the first half, at that time, I don't think the Bolt recall was out like maybe you knew about that, so maybe it was considered in that. But because if we back out the warranty stuff you're talking about here, it's more like a $6 billion half-over-half headwind. So I just want to understand, really, some of the moving pieces and what changed maybe from your prior communications. Paul Jacobson : Yes. So we've obviously provided more color, Joe, into some of the underlyings, and what we talked about more in detail today is the particular nuances around GMF. So when you look at used car valuations, there reaches a point where you get to contractual value and you don't participate in the upside, and Dan's on the call, too, and he can provide more color in this space.  We also have fewer lease vehicles coming on, which was a function of leases underwritten about 3 years ago in the second half of the year. And then most importantly, you've got the -- from the credit performance, there's a component of that under the new accounting standards for accounting for credit reserves that is kind of a onetime adjustment going forward. So we see those pressures.  But I think when you look at the underlying business, you look at pricing has remained consistent, you look at some material costs, which are coming with the higher trims. We think that we're able to overcome some of these, going forward. So like I said, there's a lot of noise going on in the short term, particularly around how we're thinking about COVID and the Delta variant, that we've got to be cautious to not extrapolate too much out of this in the longer term. Joseph Spak : Okay. But just to be clear, like I guess, like if we look at the GMF and the higher commodity costs, that's, I guess, sort of in line with what you were communicating prior, like I agree, we're getting more detail and we have some of the lower volumes. I know you take more downtime than was probably expected back then. But it does still -- I mean, it still seems like there's something else, especially if we sort of back out some of that warranty, which, again, I don't think was considered in that first half or that second quarter number. So I know you're pointing to growth and other things, but is there anything else that we should consider in the variance? Mary Barra : I'm not sure, Joe. I guess I'm not sure what you're specifically referencing because I think we've been pretty clear about the moving pieces that make H1 different than H2, but then also talking about our confidence in the business with the margins in North America, the strong pricing power we think we have. So I guess I'm not sure we're understanding your question here. Joseph Spak : Well, I get -- let me try this. I guess, like maybe just to put it this way, when you sort of indicated the $4 billion to $5 billion for the second quarter, was the warranty stuff already included in that number? Paul Jacobson : It was not. But not the two recalls. Joseph Spak : Right. So then like if we back that out, it just seems like the second half versus first half variance is greater than you previously indicated. I understand you're sort of showing some of the moving parts. But like the variance drivers you sort of call out don't seem to fully add up to that number, which would be more like $6 billion ex that warranty number. Paul Jacobson : Well, and I think we can take this off-line and work through it. But I think the other variable here is volume and the fact that we're widening the range here intentionally, given both sort of COVID and sort of the situation that we're seeing in Malaysia. So I think the variability is probably just in production, which is where we're intentionally casting a wide range given some of the near-term uncertainty. And we'll obviously clarify that as we work through it but wanted to proceed cautiously because everybody is talking about the Delta variant of COVID right now. And we want to make sure that we're mindful of hitting the goals that we put out there for the Street. Joseph Spak : Okay. That helps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Just to follow up on that. I mean, expectations out there have been that the semi issue is kind of got -- was at its worst in Q2 and then sort of crawling out Q3, Q4. Are you basically saying you see a big concern that, that has changed with this new variant coming out potentially shutting down some semi plants again? Is that sort of the messaging in that lower production outlook for the second half, just so I'm clear? Mary Barra : Colin, I think we just don't know. I mean everybody is learning more about the Delta variant. What I am confident about, though, is we have safety protocols that we know when we follow, people are safe, and that's why we instituted the mask -- reinstituted the mask requirement in the U.S., and some of our other operations around the world, we never stopped wearing masks. So we think we've learned a lot. We're sharing our lessons learned across the globe with the supply base deep into the tiered suppliers, so they have the benefit that we think will help us keep the supply coming. But I think you've heard several other within industry and across, just there are unknowns with the Delta variant, and that's why we're being appropriately cautious. But we do think this is a very different situation than it was 15 months ago because we know how to keep people safe in our operations. Colin Langan : Got it, all right. And then a lot of companies are talking about -- a lot of automakers are talking about sort of how the world may change coming out of this in terms of how you stock inventory and maybe pushing more online. I mean any update on your view on sort of what is the right level of inventory coming out of this to restock to? And whether -- I think you're already selling a lot of vehicles like the Hummer online. I mean, is that going to be even a greater part of your strategy going forward, too? Mary Barra : Absolutely. We've learned a lot and big credit to our dealers. We've also given them tools that give them insight into the pipeline, also using data analytics so they order the most optimal products that are going to move fast. So I'm not going to give you a specific number because it's going to depend by segment. But we believe that the optimized inventory level is higher than what it is today. But I think we'd all agree, it's pretty low but much lower than it has been with our historical levels. And it's because of everything we've learned in the way we are approaching selling online, taking orders in some cases.  But also, we know there's a customer who wants to go to the dealer and drive off with a new vehicle. We want to service them as well. And that's why I think some of the tools we've put in place to help our dealers have the vehicles that they want is going to be very important. So again, I think we're going to be much more efficient, and it will be a true partnership with our dealers as we optimize on both ends. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Super Cruise is something that's come up on a couple of earnings calls consecutively now, and it's something that's pretty interesting and I think an opportunity not only to have an add-on sale at the time of purchase but also a potential subscription feature, longer term. So maybe you could talk about the implications of deploying Super Cruise. I think '22 models by the end of 2023 is the plan. And what sort of EBITDA implications there can be as you start deploying Super Cruise? Mary Barra : Yes. Well, I appreciate your excitement for Super Cruise. As I think we've shared in the past, over, I think, it's between 80% and 85% of those who have experienced Super Cruise say they either must have it on their next vehicle or strongly desire it. And I'm excited to have more people experience Super Cruise, and we'll provide that opportunity at our Investor Day. So I do think there's a huge opportunity.  We've also taken the cost down of what it takes to implement Super Cruise on a vehicle as we're expanding its capabilities, the number of roads that are mapped to be able to leverage it. And so this does give us an opportunity, either to sell it or to provide it as a vehicle subscription service that I think is going to be significant. And overall, I'm not going to break out Super Cruise specifically, but I will tell you when we are in our Investor Day, we will provide the opportunity we see broadly in connected vehicle services and subscriptions and then vehicle-related services like OnStar Insurance that is doing quite well as we expand that. So I think there's a huge opportunity in this service space based on the connected vehicle that gives us a very different margin profile and a true growth opportunity. And we'll frame that out for you in October. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. And for my follow-up question, the company guided to some incremental investment in the second half of this year related to the $35 billion of total investment planned for EVs and AVs. And so should investors think about the run rate you're seeing now in the second half as fully reflective of the added cost for this program? Or should we be anticipating some additional step-up as you go into next year? And if so, can you help to frame that? Mary Barra : So we increased from $27 billion to $35 billion over the '20 to '25 time frame. And I think that represents the acceleration of not only EVs, and we talked about a couple of new vehicles that we have out. We have obviously more coming, but then also our confidence in EV growth that we announced the 2 additional battery cell plants.  So when you talk about a run rate from a capital perspective, I think we announced we're in the $9 billion to, what was it, $9.5 billion -- $9 billion to $10 billion this year. And I think we see similar ranges as we move forward. But again, in this acceleration period getting to EVs and then we expect that will come back down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Mary, so insurance, you mentioned it, but I would love if you could give us a bit more. Where are you rolling it out? Anything at all on take rate? Because I'm thinking, and correct me if I'm wrong, Mary, that when you connect the car and the OTA and the insights coming off the car, you're able to engage a consumer directly on insurance services through the car pretty much, right, as the car as both the actuary and the agent. Is that correct? Mary Barra : Yes, Adam. First of all, hello there. And yes, I do think that you're thinking about it correctly. We can engage directly because you can't take ownership of vehicle... Adam Jonas : Mary? Hello? Mary Barra : Yes. Can you hear me? Adam Jonas : Sorry. Yes. Mary Barra : Okay, sorry. So as we look at insurance, first of all, it's going well. We're now in about 20 states. The ability to pull information off the vehicle to help inform rates is actually exceeding our expectations. And so -- and we're expanding. And as you mentioned, we -- a person cannot buy a vehicle without having proof of insurance. So we are right there able to offer it and not have to do a lot of the advertising that other insurance companies have to do. So we think we're well situated to disrupt auto insurance, and I'm very pleased with the way our rollout is progressing and we'll share more in October. Adam Jonas : Great. Just one follow-up, again, on insurance. I think it's so interesting, where does that leave the dealer? Dealers make like almost $1,000 originating these policies, and I'm wondering if this opportunity to go direct or engage direct can help save -- can get some inefficiencies out and, I'd say, obviate the need to write this $1,000 check to a dealer that's just not necessary when the car is doing the work. Mary Barra : Adam, I'm not sure where you're getting this $1,000 check that's being written to the dealers. We do have some dealers that provide insurance companies in. But again, I would look at this as totally disrupting the way insurance is delivered to the customer. And again, I'm not -- I don't think the information on the $1,000 check written to the dealer is correct. Daniel Berce : Yes. Mary, this is Dan. Maybe I'll interject. The F&I that the dealer earns is more extended warranties gap, other traditional point-of-sale products. That F&I income typically doesn't include any commissions on private passenger insurance that we're talking about for OnStar. So this is totally separate than what the dealer already earns. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Just to go back to the second half, just a couple of clarifications. First, are you able to share what you think your U.S. dealer inventory might come in by year-end but perhaps a range, just given the downtime in the second half? And then just to clarify on the pricing assumption for the second half, are you assuming some moderation versus H1 or maybe some other assumption there? Paul Jacobson : Itay, I'll take that. So we are expecting inventory to decline a little bit further off of these levels, just given where we are in production and the strong demand environment. And as we said in the earlier comments, I think pricing remains strong, both in terms of incentives but also in terms of the rich mix that customers are demanding right now. And we don't see anything in the short-run horizon that, that is going to disrupt that. And certainly, the, I think, lower inventories are going to support kind of the current pricing environment in the near term. Itay Michaeli : Great, that's helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe turning to Cruise. I think the release mentioned that they're making excellent progress towards commercializing it. Any additional call you can share in terms of the progress they've made? I think that the last data we all received were the California disengagement reports. Any additional color you can share in terms of the progress to date there? Mary Barra : We will share more at our Investor Day, and I'm excited to do that. But I would say I am having conversations with Dan on a weekly basis, and we continue to see very strong progress in the technology that they're doing and also readying the company from a commercialization perspective. And so again, I'll say no more than I reiterate, this is quarters away, not years away, and the technology is really progressing well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : I was hoping if you can give us a little bit more color around the expected cadence of the production outlook that's contemplated in your guidance. So North America production down about 100,000 units in the second half. Is it going to be -- how should we think about that sequentially versus sort of what we've seen in the second quarter? I think that some of the third-party estimates out there, at least for the industry, were assuming that the fourth quarter would come back to more normalized levels of industry production. Is that your view as well or are you assuming that some of the disruptions could continue for the rest of the year? Paul Jacobson : So Emmanuel, we -- I would say that it's -- the production rates are skewed higher as we get through the year. Some of the near-term issues that we've talked about with the short-term shutdowns of the truck plants and what we keep reiterating about semiconductors, I think it's a little bit of a different challenge than what we've seen before in just terms of broad semiconductor supply, it's about throughput, et cetera.  So we have continued to believe that as we get into the fourth quarter, some of the underlying semiconductor challenges are going to start to abate. We don't know that it will be fully resolved then, but we're being cautious and we're seeing signs for improvement. And as we've said, you can see light at the end of the tunnel as we're getting towards that. So production rates naturally be higher in the fourth quarter than the third. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then another math question, if I may, around the second half guidance. I'm struggling to reconcile to the high end of your EBIT range. I think you did $8.5 billion of EBIT in the first half, second half implied guidance is $3 billion to $5 billion. But then you described sequential headwinds worth at least $3.5 billion and then also in volume, which could be another $1 billion headwind at least. So I guess, are there any positive offsets in that sequential walk that I should consider? Under what conditions could GM earn $5 billion in the second half? Paul Jacobson : Well, I think as we highlighted, and I appreciate you going through that table, because as we highlighted the headwinds and that's in the investor deck, it's a $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion range. And I think to some of the earlier questions, if you take the ex-recall run rate off of that, the $9.7 billion , so you get to about the $5 billion second half to maybe a little bit higher than that. But that's where the production variability comes in and why we've been intentional about widening the range on that.  So what I would say is the upside could be the further improvement in consumer strength that we can capitalize on. And then is there an opportunity to outproduce the assumptions that are in our guidance? And that's going to be a function primarily of chip availability and COVID. So I just want to emphasize the caution that we're putting into that. And if the environment abates and this resolves quickly, then I would expect that we would outperform the midpoint. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : My question, which is on inflation. I realized you are facing and working to offset the impact of higher commodity costs, which are expected to be a considerable headwind in the back half, both year-over-year and sequentially versus the first half. But taking a step back, how do you think the company is positioned overall for inflation, including if it were to prove sustained or to track materially stronger? Do you think there's a scenario where you could actually stand to benefit from inflation applying broadly to your revenue but more selectively to your cost structure? So for example, like D&A won't go up medium term from inflation but instead only as you replace assets over time, right, and your substantial hourly labor costs in the U.S. were, in 2019, already agreed upon through 2023, so you shouldn't be seeing the same pressure from wage inflation that other companies are likely to see. Given all these, I'm curious if inflation could actually help margin, at least near to medium term as opposed to hurt margin. Can you help us think through this dynamic? Mary Barra : Well, I think you referenced a handful of areas where we won't be impacted by inflation. But I also think you have to look at, overall, the customer's ability to pay and what they're going to allocate from a discretionary perspective. And so I think that tends to put a cap on it. I would say we have an extremely strong portfolio out now and more very strong products coming. But I think you do have to always keep in mind overall affordability, and I think that might tap down any of that disproportionate opportunity for our industry. Ryan Brinkman : That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, could you remind us of what hedging strategies you may have or not have in place with regard to certain commodities, in particular, platinum group metals? I'm not advocating one approach over another. I realize one of your crosstown rivals has had a checkered experience there. But just curious what your approach is to this risk, and if you've changed your approach at all, given the current environment. And then can you maybe talk to about like how your commodity exposures or risk could change over time as you shift away from internal combustion engines with catalytic converters toward battery electric vehicles with their own set of different commodity exposures? Mary Barra : So I'll take the second half and I'll let Paul answer the specific on the hedging. But I think if you look to the comments that I made that we're looking not only for semiconductors but for other critical minerals and other critical materials that we need for our battery strategy to have long-term supply, whether it's investment that we make, partnerships we do or supply agreements. And so I think when you look at that, along with the fact that some of these material or precious metals, we're looking to reduce our need for them with the technology, specifically the chemistry in the battery. So I think we're looking to manage that very carefully as we accelerate the move to EVs. And then for the hedge, I'll turn to you, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Yes. I mean, on the hedging, we use some options just mainly as sort of a cheaper insurance against large moves. We also just have some embedded price sharing mechanisms in the supply chain agreements themselves, whether it's averaging, et cetera. So we try to manage that holistically. I don't think we're overreacting to that because, look, materials inflation is just an underlying cost to the business, and we have to make sure that we can take the steps necessary. So for example, the engineering team is always looking at ways to reduce material spend, drive efficiencies into the business, et cetera. And that's the most basic, most important hedge because it results in a permanent savings within the business. So I don't want to rely too much on sort of financial derivatives to delay or defer a problem that we need to be solving over the long term anyway. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Aileen Smith : This is Aileen Smith on for John. I appreciate you getting us in here at the last minute. I wanted to follow up, I think, to Rod's question on the cost side of what current cost dynamics we should be assuming as persisting into next year versus resolving. We've heard from some suppliers this quarter that they've been somewhat successful in securing spot purchases of semiconductors so as not to impact their automaker customers, and in those cases, that automakers have been fairly receptive to absorbing or sharing that excess cost on semis.  Is this consistent with how you've been working with your suppliers in taking on a bit more of that cost? And do you have any estimate what that might have been in the quarter in terms of incremental material or component costs? Just trying to get a sense of how these costs might abate at the same time that volumes come back and you get the benefit of operating leverage. Paul Jacobson : Well, I certainly think that there are short-term supply and demand implications out there to everything that's going on, and that doesn't surprise me about the spot market as well. But what I would say is that the -- when you look at the overall cost of the vehicle, the chips are a small, small piece of that. So I don't see it as anything very material for us. And I don't want to get into any details of how we're managing tactically to get through this other than to say that the partnership with our supply chain up and down through all of our tiers and our global supply chain function as well as our engineering and manufacturing, I believe we're the best in the business at this. And you see that in the production results and the ability for us to keep the plants running as successful as we have throughout the year. Aileen Smith : Okay, that's helpful. And then I wanted to follow up on Mary's answer to an earlier question on the EV and AV spending target of $35 billion. First, as a clarification, is it fair to pull out our rulers when we look at that pie chart on Slide 5 and say 1/3 of it appears to be R&D and engineering expenses versus 2/3 maybe more CapEx-related? And more specifically, as we compare the $35 billion target to the prior $27 billion one that was as of last year, that increase is also largely a function of CapEx towards cell and vehicle plants rather than what you see as being any major incremental investment on R&D, whether on the technology or product side to commercialize EVs and AVs. Mary Barra : No, I wouldn't say that. I think we increased it and we said it covers both capital and engineering. And it probably wouldn't -- I mean, it's -- I would say the chart is directionally correct. I think you shouldn't pull out your ruler. But we're moving all aspects of it for whether it's the battery plants that we've talked about, capital to increase the offerings that we'll have and then actual engineering on the products themselves, along with continuing to support Cruise. So it's -- the chart is accurate in how we're spending across all of those. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for closing comments. . Mary Barra : Well, thanks, everybody. We really appreciate your questions and for participating today. I want to step back and say, when we look at our team's dedication to everything that we have been working to offset and accelerate, we are building a stronger and a better future for our company and for our stakeholders and for the communities in which we live and work.  By exceeding our business targets, we have the resources to move more quickly toward creating an all-EV future and all-AV future. And when you look at the combination of our Ultium battery platforms, our Hydrotec platforms for fuel cells, as well as our software and platform that we've named Ultifi, we really think that we have a strategy that will allow us to drive higher revenue, operating efficiencies and improved and outstanding customer experience. When you look at Ultium, it does deliver better performance range, and then it gives us flexibility and scalability that is going to allow us to accelerate the EVs that we're going to put into market across the entire portfolio. And the work that we'll share more of what we're doing to continue to improve battery costs will also allow us to open up into not only more segments but also markets outside the auto industry.  And then when you think about, from a software perspective, the strength that we have of OnStar, our ability to do over-the-year updates and the work that we have from a processing power perspective in the vehicle as well as the cybersecurity perspective, we think we have an ecosystem that will increase and build on the leading loyalty that we have will allow us to provide unmatched personalization. We'll expand features, like we've already talked about, with Super Cruise and really create new connected services.  So I couldn't be more excited about the future of the business and the opportunities that we have for growth and margin expansion when we look at all these different businesses. So we look forward to hosting you in October, and we truly believe you will experience this future for yourselves. So thanks, everybody, again, for your time, and please stay safe.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning and welcome to General Motors. Third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. We are asking analysts to please limit yourself to 1 question and a brief follow-up. [Operator instructions ]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday October 27, 2021. I would now I'd like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Jamie. Good morning and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for this third quarter of 2021. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We're also broadcasting this call via webcast. I'm joined today by Mary Barra, GM's chair and CEO, Paul Jacobson, GM CFO, and Dan Berce, President of GM Financial. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. I will now turn the call over to Mary Barra. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rocky, and hello everyone. It's great to have an opportunity to talk with you all again today. Before Paul and I discuss our third quarter results, I want to thank all of you who participated in person or remotely in our recent Investor Day. Our team really appreciated the opportunity to deep dive our growth strategy and to hear your perspective. After spending time with our leaders and subject matter experts, I hope it's clear to you that we have assembled the right technology to have the right platforms and we have the right talent to achieve our long-term goals, including doubling our annual revenue and expanding our margins. Our confidence comes from the fact that we are already making significant progress in transforming GM, from a traditional automaker to really a platform innovator. You can see it in the conversion of the Orient assembly and factory 0 plants as they have gone from building gas-powered cars to EVs, the construction of our Ultium Cell JV plants, the rapid expansion of Super Cruise, the development of level 2 plus autonomy with Ultra Cruise, the lead Cruise has in level 4 autonomous driving and our portfolio of 20 startup businesses. You can also experience it in the software and services that will enhance our customers lives and drive growth. And you can see it in our talent and expertise. This includes the new digital business team that we formed to establish digital market leadership for GM and our expanded board of directors who have deep experience in IT, E-commerce, software development, venture capital, cybersecurity, and more. As one of you observed, the real magic happens in our vehicles at the intersection of the Ultium and Ultifi platforms. Ultium enables us to efficiently deliver the industry's broadest portfolio of EVs, including a diverse portfolio of truck entries. And the beauty of Ultifi is the way it will allow us to deploy new software and services rapidly and securely across our entire fleet. This includes Super Cruise upgrades and services we'll create in the future. And seeing is believing. I have to tell you, I will never forget the overwhelmingly positive reaction that people had after they experienced Super Cruise or had an opportunity to ride in the GMC Hummer EV and experienced Watts to Freedom for the very first time. The same can be said for the Cadillac LYRIQ, that we'll begin delivering to customers next spring. They were spoken for in just about 10 minutes after we opened the reservation site, so I think that starts to show the strong demand that we will see for the Lyriq. Our next EV reveal will be the Chevrolet Silverado EV and I can tell you the truck is amazing. Our dealers love it and so you won't want to miss it when we take the cover off at CES in early January. It will evoke passionate enthusiasm through great design and engineering and we believe it will drive mass adoption of electric vehicles, specifically trucks. And I promise you that the capabilities of Ultium and Ultifi will be just as evident in mass market vehicles like the $30,000 Chevrolet EV crossover, which we showed. And as Mark shared, we\u2019re also working on another EV that's even more affordable than that. But to be clear, we will also continue to improve the successful ICE vehicles that are funding our future. And we'll do that while improving them to reduce emissions and also offer new technologies. Our plan provides resources to maintain leadership in key segments like trucks and SUVs during and after the transition to electric vehicles. And although it's only been about 3 weeks since Investor Day, the strategies and initiatives we talked about have advanced even further. Let's talk first about our work to build a strong and secure battery supply chain in North America. We've established and announced 4 major supply chain initiatives recently, and we expect to add more soon to support our growth, our performance, and our cost reduction plans. And our goal is to eliminate supply chain risks that control -- and control our own destiny as we rapidly scale our EV volumes. A common thread that runs through these and our recent announcement is a clear commitment to U.S. leadership in EVs. For example, we will add 2 more battery plants in the U.S. by mid-decade. We also have plans to build EV motors and another EV truck facility here in the U.S. We look forward to sharing the details very soon, but keep in mind, this is just the beginning. As Gerald said at Investor Day, we forecast that North American EV assembly capacity will reach 20 % by 2025, and climbed to 50 % by 2030. We're also bringing Ultium to China starting with the Lyriq, which is launching in early 2022, and GM China also recently announced it's doubling the size of its advanced design center to support EV development. Cruise is the second opportunity that I want to highlight. As you know, we have always gated the progress of Cruise by safety. As we speak, Cruise is just one state level approval away from full regulatory approval to charge customers for rides in San Francisco. And it is still the only Company with a permit to provide full driverless ride-hailed service in the city. As Cruise CEO, Dan Ammann, said, complementary skills of GM and Cruise have brought it to the cusp of commercialization. This includes the launch of the Cruise Origin that will be produced at Factory ZERO and we have already built dozens of engineering development vehicles like the ones you saw during Investor Day. All of this is why joining Cruise is so high among experts in artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics; and why Cruise is hosting another series of virtual recruiting events called Under the Hood on November 4th. If you'd like to participate, please contact GM Investor Relations.  Now, let's turn to earnings. As we have shared before we are taking advantage of GM's strong cash flow to fund our investments in growth. Our third quarter results, which, while reflecting the near-term challenges of the global semiconductor supply chain issues, clearly shows the strength of our underlying business. We reported EBIT adjusted of 2.9 billion, which includes another strong performance by GM Financial and our joint ventures in China, as well as a recall cost settlement with LG. LG has been and continues to be a very valued and respected partner and we are working closely with them to deliver replacement battery modules for our customers. In fact, we began scheduling and completing repairs this month. While the semiconductor situation improves, I believe our full-year performance will be strong from an earnings perspective and far ahead of where we expect it to be at the beginning of the year. And most importantly, as we manage this dynamic environment, our clear focus is on transforming GM. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul, who will share more about the quarter and our outlook. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate you taking the time to join us. We outlined our long-term strategy earlier this month, including the opportunity to double our revenues and expand margins by 2030. We believe that the strength of our underlying business today is a crucial element to delivering on that growth, and I'm proud of the execution by our team during the quarter in the face of continued challenges. So let's get into the results of the quarter in more detail.In Q3, we generated $26.8 billion in net revenue, $2.9 billion in EBIT adjusted, 10.9% EBIT adjusted margin, and $1.52 in EPS diluted adjusted. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was negative $4.4 billion during the quarter, due to higher work-in-process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules and working capital impacts from plant downtime in lower production levels, as a result of the ongoing semiconductor shortage. We expect the impact on working capital to unwind contributing to positive free cash flow as production increases and vehicles built without the modules are completed and wholesaled. We realized strong price and mix performance in North America again, through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategies. Additionally, used vehicle prices drove continued excellent results at GM Financial. In the quarter, we also reached an agreement with LG to substantially recover the cost of the recall. The pretax impact to the quarter of this recovery agreement and associated recall was $700 million. So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q3, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.1 billion with continued strong pricing on our full-size pickups and SUVs, and the recovery agreement with LG. We generated a 10.3% EBIT adjusted margin in the region. From a pricing standpoint, we're continuing to see high customer demand for our products and limited dealer inventory, which is driving strong transaction prices and lower incentive spend. In the quarter, our incentive spend as a percentage of ATP fell to 4.67%, 7.4 percentage points below Q3 2020. And even with these ATPs, we're growing or maintaining share in key segments. For example, almost seven out of every ten customers in the full-size SUV segment purchased a Tahoe, Suburban, or Yukon. The Escalade remains the best selling large -- luxury SUV by a significant margin. That said, our overall volume in inventories remain low, which is impacting total market share in the region. We ended the quarter with approximately 129,000 units in U.S. dealer inventory. We foresee low inventories and strong pricing continuing well into next year, even as production volumes are expected to increase. Let's move to GM international. GMI EBIT adjusted was $200 million, up 200 million a year over a year, as we experienced positive price and mix benefits across the segment. China equity income was $300 million in the quarter, despite the semiconductor impacts due to continued strong mix, stabilization in pricing, and material cost performance. GMI excluding China equity income has made substantial progress toward breakeven despite the impact of semiconductors, reinforcing the structural progress on our path to sustainable profitability and cash flow.  A few comments on GM Financial, Cruise and corporate segments. GM Financial has continued its record-setting pace with Q3 EBT adjusted of $1.1 billion as used vehicle prices and favorable consumer credit trends continue. We've received $1.8 billion in dividends from GM Financial year-to-date. And we anticipate additional dividends to be paid in the fourth quarter. Cruise losses in the quarter were $300 million and Corp EBIT was a loss of $200 million in line with our run rate estimates of general and administrative costs, including investments in growth and our new businesses.  Let's turn to the outlook for the rest of the year. Despite some ongoing volatility in the supply chain which our teams continue to work to mitigate, we expect sequentially higher volumes in Q4. We also expect costs from commodities and logistics to increase along with investments in our growth initiatives. I want to make sure that we clearly articulate how we're performing relative to the guidance we have in the market. As you recall, we began the year with a guided range of $10 to $11 billion of EBITDA adjusted and provided updated full-year EBITDA adjusted guidance at Q2 earnings of $11.5 to $13.5 billion. We now expect to achieve EBITDA adjusted approaching the high end of that range. Our EPS diluted adjusted range will increase to $5.70 to $6.70 driven by a revised full-year effective tax rate due to favorable tax determinations in a mix of global earnings. We also expect to achieve EPS diluted adjusted approaching the high end of that range. Now I want to provide an update on our capital spending, including investments in Ultium JVs. We now expect spend to be in the $8 to $9 billion range this year, slightly below the 9 to $10 billion range we previously provided. This decrease is a result of both innovative work by our team to reduce required capital investments, while maintaining the schedule on our upcoming product programs, as well as certain timing of invoices that will shift into early '22. Adjusted automotive free cash flow for the year is expected to be approximately $1 billion. Note that this guidance now includes the impact of remaining work in process inventory related to vehicles produced without certain modules at the end of the year. Through the fourth quarter, we expect to clear the majority of our work-in-process inventory, but anticipate some inventory will remain at year-end. As we've indicated, these units will provide additional cash flow in the first half of 2022 as we wholesale the vehicles. To close, we're at an inflection point for GM and we're focused on new metrics and KPIs as we progress on this journey. We plan to begin to provide some interim milestones and KPIs that we will use to benchmark our performance relative to the growth plan that we laid out at our Investor Event. We look forward to sharing that with you in the coming months. As we execute on our growth plan, we will maintain the strong business we have today and these results demonstrate that. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q and A portion of the call. Operator : A reminder to analyst, we are asking to limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up so that we may get to everyone on the call. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning, everyone. And thank you. First, just a question on the pace of volume recovery. Can you just tell us do you have any risk from the emerging magnesium shortage? And then, maybe you could just tell us your expectations on what the pace of improvement is in volumes, what the baseline expectations is for when the supply shortages will be fully mitigated? Just the shape of recovery ahead. Mary Barra : Yeah, thanks, Dan. Related to the Chinese magnesium shortages. Well, we do think there is some near-term price escalation risk. We do not see it as a significant supply risk or constraint for our North America operations. The aluminum alloys we purchased have a very small percent of magnesium and nearly all of our aluminum is domestically sourced. So we are working with our supply base and we continue to monitor the situation. We'll take appropriate mitigation steps if needed but that's our view right now. And Paul, I'll let you talk volumes. Paul Jacobson : Sure. Good morning, Dan. Thanks for your question. So when we outlined the second half trajectory on volume, we said that we expected it to be down approximately 200,000 units. Second half to first half with the majority of that occurring in Q3. That's certainly what we have seen. So we expect a pretty sizable step-up in volume sequentially from Q3 into Q4. That being said, when we look at Q4 volumes, they look more like what we saw volumes in the second quarter, but we have significant additional cost pressures that we've seen, most of which relate to either commodity inflation or more importantly, investments that we're making in the growth side of the business and in our manufacturing facilities as well. So volume is certainly recovering off of where we were in Q3 ,which is consistent with what we said, and we would hope to see that and expect to see that as we go through 2022. Dan Levy : Okay. So continued improvement through 2022, it sounds like. That was just a sequential -- you have ongoing sequential improvements.. Okay. Thank you. My second question is -- I want to draw -- a question on EV margins. I want to draw a comparison with a certain EV automaker which just put up a very strong third quarter, and I think you're finally starting to see the EV margins materialize [Indiscernible] have in the past now, I know you put out the target for your BEV margins to be equal to or better than ICE, and I know in battery, you laid out certain battery targets that's going to be a big part. But I'm wondering if you could just walk us through maybe the other areas where you could see opportunity to boost EV margins, setting aside the software opportunity, just how easily those things could be attained. Is it just better architecture consolidation, greater vehicles simplicity? Is it more in-sourcing or more digital, or quasi direct-to-retail sales? Just what other opportunities are there to improve the EV margins aside from the battery cost? Mary Barra : Sure. You rattled off a lot of them, Dan. Obviously, as we get scale -- the battery improvement is not insignificant but as we get the scale part of that and get scale with the vehicles, I think you're going to see margins improve. We definitely are leveraging the Ultium platform and being able to launch in roughly half the time, there's just savings coming from that from a less engineering because we already are working off the platform as well as the way we've done the control system. And we're looking across all aspects of the vehicle to ensure that EVs are affordable, really focused on what customers want. We do extensive consumer clinics to understand what's going to be important. I think you'll see at every aspect of the vehicle we're looking to improve and then the scale that we'll be able to get across platforms, I think, it's going to drive it. The battery cost will be another. And then, you mentioned it, but on top of that will be the services and that revenue that you don't get until you sell a vehicle. So we are working on that plan quite aggressively. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hi everybody. Can you hear me? Mary Barra : Yeah. Hi, Rod. Paul Jacobson : And good morning, Rod. Rod Lache : Hi. Good morning. I was hoping just first, you can help us a little bit more with some thoughts on 2022. I know it's still early. We know some of the big items. You're going to have volume upside on the positive side and it's been, like, a $10 billion headwind volume for you over the course of '19 with the strike, and '20 and '21 with these shortages. That's going to be offset by some headwind from raw materials you're spending on EVs and some reversion of GM Financial, but can you provide some high-level brackets on how we should be thinking about that? In particular, the volume, the raws and the spending because it sounds like you still believe that a path to 10% margin in North America is plausible? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. I'll start with that, Rod and Mary can add in any additional however she wants to give, obviously. I think we certainly do still see that path. I think you outlined the big moving pieces in your question itself. We're certainly going to see it lift in volume. I think we're going to see a very different mix because the incremental volume that will be coming on, will be coming on at a little bit lower of a contribution than what we've seen given some of the prioritization actions we took this year. Going forward, we do have that commodity inflation, but we still remain convicted about our ability to be able to offset either that through productivity or through some of the pricing actions that we've seen. Certainly we've seen the chips impact, trim mixes, and other things that we would otherwise want to be doing but we've had to reduce a little bit. So I think we're certainly looking at next year right now in detail, and we'll have more color to provide as we get into early 2022. Rod Lache : Okay. But you can't provide any kind of high-level brackets around magnitude of maybe commodity just based on where spot prices are or what is plausible for volume or spending? Paul Jacobson : Well, I think we said earlier this year, that we expected the bulk of the commodity inflation to occur in the first half of the year. Everything is moving around, obviously, as we've seen, a lot of volatility in broadly commodities and the supply chain. We've seen a little bit of that retraced from the highs of this summer. So we're triangulating around that, but we've seen a couple of billion dollars as we look at 2022, right now. But that could go either way, based on the volatility we've seen. So that's why I'm hesitant to anchor on it right now. We're certainly looking at macro trends and that's part of the process and we'll provide more detail as we go through our budget plans. Rod Lache : Okay. Thanks. And just second, there is a little bit of confusion this morning about the drivers in Q4 versus Q3. So I was hoping maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that. In the third quarter, ex the reimbursement, it looks like EBIT would've been about 2.2 billion and it looks like your guidance if you hit the high end of the range would be around 2.1 in Q4, but it sounds like you've got a fair amount of WIP inventory now, so volumes should be up quite a bit. Maybe there's some adjustment you've got in GMF and you said some mix in commodities. But can you maybe talk a little bit to some of the magnitude of those sequential moving parts? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So if you look at the wholesale numbers that we articulated, you'd see a pretty sizable jump from Q3 to Q4 included in that is clearing out some of the build shy going forward. But when you look at -- sequentially in terms of costs, you've got some seasonality in the fixed costs there. You've got investments in the future, particularly around some of the manufacturing plants, marketing-related to the new campaigns and the new vehicle launches going forward, and just general investment in engineering and growth across the board. That's putting on some of the cost pressure going forward, but that is the type of long-term decisions that Mary has mentioned where we're staying focused on as we go through this. Rod Lache : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning. Paul, maybe just to follow-up here, if we look at this third quarter, and we back out the 2 items from the LG reimbursement and also the cost then you had -- it looks like about a $2.2 billion headwind in costs. You just went through commodities, investments. I think there's also a non repeat to some of the [austerity] (ph) but can you help us bucket some of that a little bit, just so we can better think about how those should trend going forward. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Jodi. Excuse me, to clarify you're talking about Q2 to Q3 sequentially? Joseph Spak : Sorry, no. In the third quarter on a year-over-year. Your cost? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Joseph Spak : Yeah. If you look at your cost and you back out the recall and the reimbursement, it was a good $2.2 billion headwind. So I'm trying to understand what made that up? Paul Jacobson : I would say, as a general rule, I would put about half of that into commodities inflation, and about half of that into growth investments going forward. And then what we've seen in our fixed cost structure. Joseph Spak : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the CAPEX, I know you said you lowered it. Some of that is efficiency, some of that sounds like timing. If we go back to your Investor event, I think you said about nine to 10 billion over the mid-term. So was that -- should we think about maybe towards the higher end or maybe even a little bit above next year, given some of these timing issues? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. I would just stick with that 9 to 10 guidance, because things bounce around from time-to-time, but I think the important thing to take away from this update is that everything is progressing on schedule and on target, and that's -- that's the biggest concern. So timing between the year will move, sometimes it moves for you, sometimes it moves against you. But what we're really tracking on is the efficiency of the investment which has gotten better, as well as the timing to make sure that we're hitting our longer-term goals, and that remains consistent. So I would just stay with the 9 to 10. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Good morning, GM Team. I want to go back to some of the unanswered questions from C&D. Probably the biggest one we've been getting is, all sounds good, but what about the capital markets? In particular whether you need time in the capital markets where billions are being devoted to pre -revenue companies. So if you think of Cruise in that light, how do you think about the tension between waiting for some commercial milestones on that, and, for example, particularly another Softbank investment if they're paying triggers that versus taking advantage of capital market conditions now? And then for the rest of the portfolio, what's the metrics you're looking about when it's time, if ever, to take at least part of those out for the public markets? Mary Barra : From a Cruise perspective, we have Cruise well funded. So we're executing aggressively to commercialization and we have the ability to do that with the steps we've already taken, as well as with GM's involvement. And I think, what you need to really look at though with Cruise, is the vertical integration with GM is a key differentiator, and I believe it's one of the reasons Cruise is so well positioned as the only person who's got the permit in San Francisco to actually take the driver out of the vehicle. That seamless integration of the technology along with leveraging Ultium, as well as our manufacturing capability are a huge value. So I think the message on Cruise is we're well funded and we have rapid commercialization plans in front of u s, and that's the play we're executing. And over the longer term the board will look at what best enhances the overall value creation and shareholder value for the gf shareholder. Brian Johnson : Well, and specifically, it seemed like Dan's pay was tied to an eventual public offering. A, is that a [Indiscernible], B, does that imply to a question of when as opposed to if, at least there's a partial offering in place? Mary Barra : I would say that the board has flexibility with the way the agreements were written to do the right thing for the GM shareholder over the long term. Brian Johnson : Okay. And some of the other things in Pam's portfolio would the idea be to hit commercialization targets or some of them less tied to the core of light vehicle business, e.g the fuel-cell business, and might be you could consider strategic actions earlier on those? Mary Barra : Again, we'll evaluate each one for what we think creates the most shareholder value from a fuel cell perspective. Clearly, there's a vehicle application as well as across many different transportation industries and even stationary power. So we remain open to structure those in a way that's going to drive the most value. Brian Johnson : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay McAuley with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Just two questions from me, one short-term, one longer-term. On the short-term, maybe going back to the second-half bridge, I think Paul, last quarter, you outlined about a 1.5-2 billion increasing commodity costs, H2 versus H1, and 0.5 billion of investments in growth. Are those still the right number to think about? And do you have a rough split of how that might trend from Q3 to Q4? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Itay, thanks for that question. What I would say, is it's still largely consistent, but it's really trending with volumes. So I would expect that more of that inflation is going to hit in Q4 than it did in Q3, just sequentially, but that's really because of the volume lift that we see quarter-to-quarter. Itay Michaeli : Got it. That's helpful. But just on a longer-term basis, I think one of the interesting takeaways on the 2030 revenue target is that you have 90 billion of EV revenue and only maybe a loss of 12 or 13 billion of ICE revenue. So that kind of implies a pretty healthy market share gains there for the EV business. Maybe talk more -- unpack that more for us around what's driving these implied share gains and is a 90 billion potentially include new regions, new markets that you don't really operate in today, or other types of agreements. Just love to get a little more detail on that split. Mary Barra : So the way I would look at it is that the forecast that we put together and the plans that underlie at our -- for our current markets. So I would say if we enter into other markets in a broader fashion, that growth on top of that. That's the way I would look at the EV margins. And again, I think it relates to the fact that how quickly we're going to have a full portfolio of vehicles across brands serving value customers, luxury customers, performance customers with our 4 brands. Itay Michaeli : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up on the magnesium and aluminum question. I guess one, how much visibility do you have? Coming from the semi issue, there hasn't been much visibility. Is aluminum -- because it's such a big, bulky item that you actually have pretty good line of sight to where your suppliers are getting their aluminum and sourcing the magnesium, which makes everything a little more complicated? And then, what about international, is there a risk there after those operations? It seems like magnesium is such a large part of global supply. Mary Barra : Let's say, as it relates specifically to China with our JVs, we're working with our partners in the supply base to closely monitor the situation and we will take mitigation actions as required. Obviously, we're working closely with the suppliers from North America perspective as well. So our current view again with all of those conversations, is that we aren't going to see a significant supply risk. Colin Langan : Got it. Okay. And then just looking at slide 13 and the GM international profits ex China have been pretty weak. Is additional restructuring needed in those regions in any color? Now that it's all lumped together, how much is South America, Korea, and I guess there's a bit rest of the world still in there? Mary Barra : Yes, go ahead. Paul Jacobson : I'll take that one, Colin. So what I would say is that you're seeing particularly in the third quarter in GMI performance, excluding China, has a lot to do with the way the chips have been allocated. So if you look at the market share, particularly in South America, it's been pretty low and near historic lows, I would say. But as you look at sequentially through the quarter and certainly what we're seeing in October, as we've been able to turn plants back on, that market share is recovering quickly. So I don't think the results that you're seeing ex-China is indicative of the run-rate capability of the performance. In fact, I think it's a testament to the restructuring efforts that have been done and we would look for further improvement in those regions as volume returns back to normal levels. Colin Langan : Okay. All right, thanks for taking my questions. Paul Jacobson : Thank you. Mary Barra : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with Wedbush. Daniel Ives : Yeah, thanks. So my question, it's not focused on next 30 or 45 days, like some, but when you're looking at the EV vision into 2022, can you walk us through the key bogeys? Obviously, it starts off with CES, but what are shorter the -- what we would view as almost the timeline and the key events going into '22, when we think about EV? Mary Barra : So I think it really starts at the end of fall this year with the Hummer EV followed by the Lyriq in launching in both United States and in China. Then we'll -- as you said at CES, we're going to be revealing the Silverado EV and this is really a redefinition and taking trucks to I'll say a new level based on what we can do with the Ultium and platform and understanding what truck owners want, but also people who are coming in who aren't our traditional truck buyers. At CES will also share a little bit more detail about the $30,000 Chevy EV that will then be revealed later in the year. And we'll have more to say with the vehicle that's even going to be more affordable than that. And again, we have a number of EVs as we've talked about, 30 by 25, so there'll be more information. But those are, what I can share with you now. So some pretty significant milestones of not only having EVs out, we will also, as we take care of our customers with the Bolt EV and EUV, we will have an opportunity to really grow that share because the vehicle was doing quite well before we took the necessary actions to protect our customers. So I see a very strong EV landscape in '22, but then in '23, it really turns on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks everybody. Hi, Mary. So Mary, you've talked about taking driver out of Cruise vehicles in quarters, not years. How confident does GM feel driver out can be achieved in 2022? Is that too soon? Mary Barra : I -- Adam Jonas : I know you're close. Mary Barra : -- I would say we're pretty confident. Adam Jonas : Okay. That's good enough for me. Mary, just a follow-up on car rental and fleet support, with the -- as your cars become more connected and software designed, OEMs are moving into it like yourselves are moving into this recurring revenue network operating model. You see that VW bought Europcar, Tesla does a major deal with a car rental firm. I'm just wondering what your 2030 targets are heavily based on software and service revenue, which implies some degree of physical fleet management. So what is GM's strategy for fleet support? You thinking Adam Jonas : more in-house and vertically integrated, you work with the franchise dealers, are there other alternatives like working with non-dealer partners like car rental or other logistics partners along the way? Thanks. Mary Barra : Sure. Well, I think if you look at how we're structuring BrightDrop from a commercial vehicle perspective, and some of the close relationships that we have with FedEx Express, etc, we as a part of BrightDrop are going to have a system that holistically helps them manage the whole ecosystem. I think that points in a direction. Having said that though, with the launch of EVs, I think, and the software services ran on the vehicle, we're not going to seed that to someone Mary Barra : else because I think that revenue and managing that is very important. And none of it starts to accrue until you actually have the vehicle being driven. But having said that, I will just say, and there's a lot of conversations going on right now and again, we're going to look at what provides us the biggest growth opportunity, not only in EV sales, but also in the whole software system to manage those fleets or provide different services to our customers. So I don't have anything specific to announce today, but I can just say there's a lot of conversations underway. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Mary Barra : Sure. Thanks, Adam. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about inventory management here in the short run midterm and long term, I think Paul, you had mentioned this about 124,000 units in dealer inventory right now to some units in work in progress. If you can let us know what that number is. Then also, for both of you, where you think that travel levels should be in the U.S. as things normalize because pre -crisis you've been running right around 800,000 units plus or minus. So it indicates that there can be very significant catch-up. But I guess the question is, where do you actually land and how much of the price activity that has been really positive to the tight inventory might be maintained? So short-term, what are we actually looking at of effective inventory? And then long-term, where do you think it stays? Hopefully tighter than history, and what does that mean for pricing? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, John. What I would say is that the inventory levels that we've seen now around that 125,000 is expected to remain low, probably into and through 2022, to be honest. I think as production ramps up in terms of what we're seeing in demand, I think the opportunities to build inventory are going to be somewhat limited, which in the short run I think is a good thing for pricing and for what we see in terms of the demand environment. Mid-term, we would expect to start building inventories off of these levels because it's not healthy where we see our dealers with empty lots, etc, and when consumers want to buy a vehicle, they want to buy a vehicle, they don't want to wait. We're meant to have more inventory. And longer-term, what I would say is, go back to what we've said from the beginning of this, that there's a lot of lessons learned in inventory management and certainly what the impact has been on pricing this year, and the right answer is certainly a lot more than what we have today, but certainly quite a bit less than what we've carried historically going forward. So as we come through this over the longer term, we'll continue to manage that dynamically through the market. But I expect it to be less than historical levels. John Murphy : I'm sorry. Mary Barra : Go ahead. John Murphy : No Mary, go ahead. I'll just follow-up after that. Mary Barra : I just -- fall spot on, the only thing I would add is we've added a lot of data analytics to better support our dealers to have the right inventory. And so I think, like Paul said, you're going to see something less but I think it's going to be much more efficient from a Company and a dealer perspective. I'm really pleased with how well that's working out with our dealers as we look at getting the right products, spec the right way to really serve the customer efficiently. John Murphy : That's incredibly helpful. And then just one question on the Cadillac ULA strategy. It sounds like there was a charge in the quarter as you're transitioning some of the dealerships out, as they don't want to tag into or invest in the new EV strategy. I'm just curious how big that is in the base of Cadillac dealerships? And if you think about the transition to EV in your entire product portfolio, how big an opportunity is this to maybe streamline and strengthen your dealership base on a stronger core, like you have in other parts of the business? Mary Barra : Yes. I think what has been accomplished with the Cadillac dealer base is very, very important and it was done the right way. We were clear with, as we transition Cadillac, it will be our lead brand moving into all EV, and wanted to make sure that the dealers were in partnership with us to make the investments that they needed to make to -- when selling electric vehicles. And for those -- and we have a lot of dealers, some are very high-volume, some are smaller. So you can imagine if they weigh that decision of what's in the best interest for them, we worked through that. So what we have now, I think, is a very efficient Cadillac dealer base that's very excited about all EV products that are coming and are making the investments to support the customer extremely well, so I think it's going to be a model as we go forward, but I'm very pleased with how that is turned out. Again, we did it in with our dealers and I think that's going prove to be the right way to do it and very strong from a customer support perspective. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Mary Barra : Morning. Paul Jacobson : Morning Emmanuel Emmanuel Rosner : So 1 follow-up on the short-term and then 1 longer term question. On the short-term, I'm curious if you could put a finer points around how some of the cost pressure you expect in the fourth quarter, are good read across the run rate for how to think about 2022. And the reason I'm asking is if I understand you well, Paul, I think you expect Q4 volumes to be about in line with Q2, but then at the same time, the guided EBITDA for Q4 is probably about half of what you did in Q2. So 3 billion versus the 4 billion. And so when I think over that $2 billion delta seems like there's commodities in there and then there's investments in the future. So first is my understanding correct,and second of all, how do I think about these costs going into next year? You spoke about commodities, what about investments in the future? Is this the run rate that is required for your plan? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So thanks, Emmanuel, for that question. In order to go back to Q2, we also have to understand that there were some one-time or shorter term impact issues that were affecting that. So when you back that out of Q2 and normalize it, you are looking at approximately a billion dollars. So GMF had true-up of some of its liabilities. Now that all that caught up to the credit terms and the used car prices were in a run rate basis at GMF that was included in Q2. We had some mark-to-market on investments as well. So if you take about a billion out and then you look at roughly a billion to a billion and a half where we were, Q4 to Q2, I would break that down into about half of that. So call it in the $700 million range being about the cost inflation and where we're seeing investment into the business on, kind of, a run rate? And then, the other half being commodities, which should vary over time. And certainly we've seen some of that pressure coming off of the peaks. Hope that answered your question. Emmanuel Rosner : That's super-clear, but the fourth-quarter, how do we think about these investments in the business on a go-forward basis? Paul Jacobson : And I think the fourth quarter is indicative of that. You see that fixed cost being roughly flat 3Q to 4Q was how we're thinking about it. But it's going to continue to grow over time as we roll-out these products and going forward. So you've seen some increase in CIB for the launches of the new EVs. Obviously, we are going to be in a pretty sizable launch cadence going forward for the next few years. And we're going to make sure that we invest in that and then we've got engineering going on for multiple projects going forward. So I think we've got good control of that where we stand and where we go. And it's stuff that we think is the right investment for the long term. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. And then on the longer term you -- I wanted to follow up on the question I asked here on the Capital Markets Day. We're very encouraged -- I was very encouraged to see your bullish long-term targets for margin, as well as the goals to improve margins in the core automotive business by 2030. My question is, how will you manage profitability in between, so between now and mid - decade, as some of these EVs roll on and ramp up at lower than average margin, as well as like some of these investments in the business as needed? How will you ensure that the profitability is on the upward trajectory before that 2030 target? Mary Barra : Yes. Emmanuel, here's the way I look at it. Obviously, as we get scale, that's going to continue to help the question that was asked before from an EV profitability perspective, so that -- we get there mid-decade and then just continue to build on that. But we are also going to be focused on investing in businesses that are going to allow us to create software businesses that have a very different margin potential overall, that's part of that. So, as we said at Investor Day, we said we -- plus or minus, we're going to maintain margins as we go forward because we think we have the capability to do that. But just to be clear, we're also going to make sure that we're doing the right investment. We're not going to constrain investment in the future growth opportunities. But the current modeling that we've done and the plan that we're executing and the targets that have been distributed that everybody is being held accountable to, we see roughly a steady and then improving towards the latter part of the decade with margins. Paul, anything to divest? Paul Jacobson : No. And I think, the additional truck capacity that's coming on is going to give us an ability to continue to grow the leading truck franchise, which, as we've said from day 1, is funding the journey. So we expect a little bit of mix uplift from that, that's going to help to offset some of that shorter-term margin pressure that you might otherwise expect to see. So this is going to be a focal point of -- as I talked about in my prepared remarks, of making sure that we're bringing transparency on KBIs and how we're thinking about the business heading through '22 and into 2023. Emmanuel Rosner : That's great [Indiscernible]. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, which is on how you are anticipating commercial negotiations with Autoparts suppliers, [Indiscernible], going forward and the potential impact -to - margin. I understand they're typically built into contracts, agreements for automakers to compensate suppliers for increases in raw material costs, but generally not for other forms of inflation such as freight, logistics, labor, etc. On some of the earnings calls so far this quarter, suppliers have discussed attempting to negotiate for reimbursement for some of these, at least non-commodity supply chain costs and even for the magnitude and suddenness of order cancellations due to the semiconductor shortage curtailing production, which again, I don't think we've historically seen automakers compensate suppliers for lower volumes coming from factors outside of their control. So I just wanted to check in with you to see how you expect these conversations may proceed and whether we should think about suppliers bearing the brunt of these non-commodity costs, or if there may be margin implications for GM? Paul Jacobson : Ryan, I'll take a shot at that, and obviously not going to go into any detail on any conversations that we're having across our supply base. But what I would say is, the singular focus is making sure that we have consistency and reduce some of the volatility that we've seen in the supply chain, whether it's due to logistics or semiconductors, etc. So we're working across-the-board because that's where the real value is, working with our suppliers to drive efficiencies across the business, as ultimately what we all have to do to be able to counter inflationary aspects of the business. But right now the here and now is navigating through some of the short-term challenges while focusing on operations. Ryan Brinkman : Thanks. That's helpful. And then my last question is a follow-up to Adam's earlier question on fleet sales. I recall that pre -pandemic you had significantly reduced your sales to daily rental card companies in particular. How are you feeling -- thinking about prioritizing of sales between retail and fleet customers and between the various categories of fleet customers with the supply chain where it is currently? And then longer-term, how do you view the relative attractiveness in profitability of the various different sales channels, such as retail, daily rental, commercial, small and medium-sized businesses, etc.? Mary Barra : Well, yes. In the past, in the traditional ICE business, daily rental was the least profitable business and we had worked to reduce that substantially and held discipline to that. They are actually though, as fleet businesses, very good as I mentioned before with what we're entering in to BrightDrop. Not only the business itself with the vehicles, but then the services and the first mile-last mile solutions that we're going to be offering, so we're going to be aggressive from that perspective and then again, I think there's new frameworks opening up from what today or what has been in the past from a rental car perspective. As I said, there's a lot of conversations going on. We're going to do what we think is in the long-term interest of maximizing our profitability and also reach with EVs, and so more to come. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Good morning and thanks very much for taking my questions. Software connected services, especially on a subscription basis, is a big focus for the auto industry is something that GM spend a lot of time focusing on at the Analyst Day. I think the Company guided for about 2 billion of subscription-related revenue this year, over 70 % EBITDA margin. And you talked about that 20 billion to 25 billion target by 2030. Can you -- can you talk about how you see the ramp from where you are this year to that 2030 target? What sort of increases should we be expecting as investors in the next few years? And is it a pretty linear increase or is it just going to be more of a backend weighted target? Paul Jacobson : Hi, good morning Mark. As we talked about, a lot of that revenue growth is really tied to the Ultifi platform and how we're going forward in terms of getting the connected car park out there, which is going to build aggressively over time as we ramp up EVs. So by definition that's going to be a little bit more back-loaded. We still -- we can see a little bit of growth on the horizon as we look at OnStar and some of the connected services which is really the baseline today going forward, but certainly we'd expect that to tick up as we -- significantly in the growth rate as we get into the second half of the decade. Mark Delaney : Understood. And my follow-up question is about end demand. Wholesales were down and, I think, a lot of it is on the supply chain challenges. But when you look at some of the macroeconomic indicators and talk to your channel and dealer network, are you seeing any changes in end demand either in the U.S. or China that we need to be monitoring? Or is the wholesale decline really just due to supply? Thanks. Mary Barra : Where selling everything we can sell. It is totally due to what we are able to supply. I'm so excited and enthused at the strong reaction to all of our products. So I am confident as we build more, we will have -- we'll see strong reaction and acceptance of those vehicles. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Portillo with Tudor Pickering Holt. Matt Portillo : Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the BrightDrop business segment. The long-term revenue growth outlook provided at CMD was quite impressive backed by initial custom orders from FedEx and Verizon. What we're hoping to get a bit more color on is how you're seeing incremental customer demand evolving given benefits highlighted on our TCO basis for buyers, and how we should think about margin progression for the business as vehicle production ramps over the next few years and accelerate revenue streams expand, helping to push margins to the low 20s long-term. Mary Barra : Yes. Matt, I think we shared quite a bit of information on our goals there. As Paul said, as we move forward in the next few months, we'll give you milestones to look at in some of those key businesses like BrightDrop, but I don't have anything more to share today. Matt Portillo : Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up question. I was just hoping to dig a bit around the medium-term outlook for Ultra Cruise, it's an extremely exciting platform. We know Supercruise is currently being rolled out to a wider range of models this year and scaling to 22 vehicles by 2023. Just curious if you could provide some guide rails and how we should be thinking about the roll-out of Ultra Cruise and at what point we could see that product launched in some of your higher volume vehicle lines? Mary Barra : With all the lessons learned that we've had with Super Cruise that as we get that technology on retail market, that we will scale it quite or make it available quite rapidly across the portfolio even faster than what we've done with Super Cruise. Matt Portillo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Barra : Great. Well, hey, thanks, everybody for all of your questions. I do want to end with saying how proud I am of the entire GM team, including our dealers and our suppliers. In every part of the Company, I see urgency, decisiveness, agility, creativity of just solving issues and finding opportunities and really leveraging them. So they are key --.our partners are key to our consistent strong performance over the last several years. And it's why I'm very confident not only that we're going to see improvements as we move through fourth quarter and into 2022, and then beyond. We are very committed to the growth strategy that we outlined as part of our Investor Day and looking forward to sharing more, not only about the exciting products and businesses that we'll be offering, but also the milestones for you to be able to track our performance. So again, I thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone stays safe. Operator : That concludes our conference call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, February 1, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rocky Gupta, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Rocky Gupta : Thanks, Jordan. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2021. Our conference call materials were issued earlier this afternoon and are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting call via webcast. I'm joined today by GM's Chair and CEO, Mary Barra; GM's CFO, Paul Jacobson; GM Financial CEO, Dan Berce; and Cruise Co-Founder, Kyle Vogt. Kyle will be available to speak about Cruise's exciting progress in the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of the chart set. The content of our call will be governed by this language. We'll now turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Hey, thanks, Rocky, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before we get into our 2021 results and 2022 outlook, I want to start with some exciting news from Cruise, which is one of our most significant growth opportunities. Kyle, Dan Kan, Gil West and the entire Cruise team are doing great work, and they just delivered a key milestone on the drive to commercialization -- to commercialize Cruise rideshare service. As Kyle has shared, Cruise team members have been taking fully driverless rides in San Francisco since November to demonstrate and refine the software and hardware ecosystem we have created together. In fact, they have logged over 20,000 miles and completed more than 600 trips. I rode in a driverless Cruise a couple of weeks ago, and I can tell you it was the highlight of my career as an engineer and as the leader of General Motors. The ride is smooth and confident. It's like having an experience and attentive driver behind the wheel. Now as Cruise announced this morning, it is inviting members of the public to sign up for their own driverless rides through a waitlist on the Cruise website. This is the first truly driverless ride-hail service offered to members of the public in a dense urban environment. To maximize its learnings, Cruise will prioritize use cases that are natural fits for autonomous ridesharing. This major milestone brings Cruise even closer to offering its first paid rides and generating $50 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade. It also means that the SoftBank Vision Fund will invest as planned another $1.35 billion in Cruise. This is another strong vote of confidence in the Cruise team, its technology and the services it's creating. Additionally, Cruise continues to advance the strong relationship it has established with Walmart, where the team is making progress on driverless deliveries of groceries to customers every day. With this incremental investment and the investments from General Motors in companies like Honda, Microsoft and Walmart, Cruise is very well capitalized to scale its business when the origin production comes online at Factory ZERO late this year. So Kyle, congrats. Now I want to turn to the significant investments we are making to expand both our battery cell and EV assembly capacity. We believe our strategy to scale a common LTM cell, component set and platform will create significant long-term value for all GM stakeholders. We also recognize that we need to launch more EVs faster. So that's exactly what we are going to do. As you know, the GMC HUMMER EV is already in the market. Cadillac LYRIQ deliveries begin in less than 60 days, and additional BrightDrop EV600 production begins at CAMI late this year, where we'll launch with an annual capacity of 30,000 units and the ability to nearly double production by mid-decade. The Chevrolet Silverado EV launches next spring and the Chevrolet Equinox and Blazer EVs will also reach the market in 2023. We have the teams working to accelerate the volume curves for all of these launches and to resume both EV and EUV production as soon as possible. And we have set a target to deliver 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of 2022 and 2023. As you know, we have also announced additional battery cell and assembly capacity investments in Michigan that will give us more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025, and this includes 600,000 full-size trucks. This is in addition to more than 1 million units of EV capacity in China over the same time frame. And I can tell you right now, 1 million units in North America won't be enough to meet the steep inflection in demand that we expect starting mid-decade for our EVs. That's why we will continue to convert ICE capacity to EVs and plan to invest in a third EV truck plant. We are formulating plans for the truck plant right now and we will share more as we work through the details. Importantly, battery cells will not be a constraint to our long-term EV growth. Our Ultium Cells JVs in Ohio and Tennessee come online in 2022 and 2023, respectively, and we will add capacity as demand grows. Our Ohio plant will launch with seven-day operations, adding 10% capacity and 200 jobs. Cell production in Michigan is scheduled to begin in late 2024. And I'm sharing today that we will announce the location of our fourth U.S. cell plant in the first half of this year. Together, these plants will support GM's EV volume growth and supply our customers in the rail, trucking, aerospace, and marine industries. Equally important for our EV strategy for North America is that it is backed by a strong, more sustainable North American-focused supply chain that includes lithium, rare earth material, permanent magnets, cathode active material, silicon carbide, motor staters, and more. To deliver this acceleration, we are pulling ahead significant investment into the 2022 to 2025 timeframe, and we will share more details as we further refine our plans. Growing customer demand for the first wave of Ultium products strongly supports these investments. We already have more than 59,000 reservations for the GMC HUMMER EV pickup and SUV. Not surprisingly, some of the first owners are very prominent figures in the sports and entertainment industries, and their initial feedback has been just incredible. They expected a super truck, and they got one. Our next electric pickup will be the Chevrolet Silverado EV. More than 110,000 Silverado EVs are reserved so far, including reservations from more than 240 fleet operators and the numbers keep growing every day. Some of the world's largest fleet customers, including FedEx, Verizon, Merchants Fleet, and Walmart, are adopting BrightDrop vehicles and their technology. All told, we have more than 25,000 production reservations for BrightDrop cargo vans. And customer interest in the Cadillac LYRIQ is growing so quickly that we\u2019ll forgo a new round of reservations and begin taking customer orders soon after the debut edition launches in March. One of our most highly anticipated reveals this year will be the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which we previewed in January. The Verge named it the best electric car of CES, saying there's a perception that electric vehicles are luxury items. So when General Motors said, the Equinox would come with a $30,000 sticker price, it's something worth noting. The efficiencies created by the Ultium platform are a key reason why we will be able to deliver truly affordable EVs like the Equinox. Affordable EVs are part of the market that start-ups aren't targeting, but they are key to driving mass adoption of EVs, which is a national and a global priority. That's why we plan to follow the Equinox with an even more affordable EV. Now let's shift and talk a little bit about our other GM growth platform. Throughout the year, you will see the expansion of advanced vehicle technologies, new shopping tools and continued progress at our new business start-ups. This spring, we will launch redesigns of the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra 1500 pickups and offer them with Super Cruise with expanded capabilities that include lane change on demand and hands-free trailering. These are first for the segment. In the same time frame, GM and our dealers will begin marketing CarBravo, our new used vehicle shopping service. This is truly a win-win. Our dealers will grow their business by offering customers online access to far more inventory than other services. In turn, we expect to drive incremental GM and GM Financial revenue by selling products like OnStar Insurance, OnStar Connected Services, accessories and financial services. It will also help support strong residual values for off-lease vehicles. Then next year, we'll roll out Ultifi, a new end-to-end software platform for EVs, AVs and ICE vehicles that will have even more sweeping over-the-air capabilities than we have today. This includes the ability to back half features to the Cadillac LYRIQ. Ultifi will be the foundation for new GM developed and approved third-party apps, in-car subscriptions and other connected services that enhance the customer experience and expand our revenue through the life of each vehicle. We can and we will keep up our aggressive pace backed by strong results. We expect to follow our record EBIT-adjusted earnings in 2021 with another year of record or near-record results in 2022, while investing significantly more year-over-year to accelerate our growth. Paul will share more details on our results and guidance in his remarks. But before I turn the call over to him, I would like to discuss our capital allocation strategy. The prospect of continued strong earnings and free cash flow, even as we invest for growth, naturally raises questions about resuming a common stock dividend. As we move forward, we will consider all opportunities to return excess capital to shareholders, but we will not reinstate a dividend at this time. Our clear priority is to accelerate our EV plan and drive growth, and we want to maintain maximum flexibility to invest as opportunities arise across our growth platforms, including many of the accelerated plans I've outlined today. I think we've consistently demonstrated that we're a team that delivers on our commitments. That's more important now than ever with the incredible opportunities in front of us. So now I'm going to turn the call over to Paul, who will walk us through the quarter and our outlook. Then Paul, Dan Berce, Kyle Vogt and I will take your questions. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to join us. As Mary mentioned, the strong results last year, including record full year EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins, are a reflection of the hard work and execution from our team and the underlying strength of our business. We're seeing strong demand for our products, especially our trucks and SUVs, and we are striving again this year to produce as many of them as we can. I want to thank the entire GM team once more for the execution during this past year. The cash that we generate today is funding the transformation of GM in pursuit of the growth strategy we shared last year in our Investor Day. We see a path to doubling revenue by 2030, while expanding margins with significant opportunities in software, services and new businesses in electric and autonomous vehicles. Now let's get into the results. While we face the well-publicized global semiconductor challenges and continued pressure from COVID protocols throughout the world, the GM team once again delivered tremendous results in 2021 through our production prioritization and work across our value chain. For the full year, we generated $127 billion in revenue, $14.3 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 11.3% EBIT-adjusted margin, $7.07 in EPS diluted adjusted and $2.6 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow.  In the fourth quarter, we generated $34 billion in revenue, $2.8 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.5% EBIT-adjusted margin, $1.35 in EPS diluted adjusted and $6.4 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was largely driven by working capital rewind as we were able to complete and wholesale over 80,000 vehicles that had previously been built without certain well as dividends from GM Financial. We saw improved semiconductor availability in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, which enabled us to increase our wholesale sequentially while substantially reducing our inventory of vehicles built without certain components, and we expect ongoing semiconductor availability improvements throughout 2022. We also realized strong price and mix performance in North America through our production prioritization actions and our go-to-market strategy. Additionally, used vehicle prices and strong credit performance continue to drive record results at GM Financial. So let's take a closer look at North America. In Q4, GM North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.2 billion as we continue to see robust customer demand for our products and tight dealer inventory, driving strong transaction prices. These results were somewhat better than our December updated guidance expectations as we saw continued volume and cost improvement. On a year-over-year basis, in the fourth quarter, we saw volume decreases and increased investments in growth, partially offset by pricing and mix. US dealer inventories ended the year at around 200,000 units, of which only approximately 25% is grounded stock, resulting in continued high sales turns of around 10 days. Moving to GM International. In the fourth quarter, GMI EBIT adjusted was approximately $0.3 billion, relatively flat year-over-year. China equity income was $0.2 billion in the quarter with continued strong mix, stabilization in pricing and material cost performance, offset by semiconductor and commodity impact. As we referenced last quarter, our international business outside of China has made substantial progress on our path to sustainable profitability. GMI EBIT-adjusted, excluding China equity income, achieved profitability in the fourth quarter despite continued semiconductor pressure and the Chevrolet brand has regained its retail market share leadership in South America. A few comments on GM Financial and the Corp segment. GM Financial concluded another extremely strong year with Q4 EBT-adjusted of $1.2 billion, with record full year EBT-adjusted of $5 billion. GM Financial paid an additional $1.7 billion dividend in Q4. That brings the total GM Financial dividends to $3.5 billion in 2021, equivalent to how much we paid for the company. Going forward, we expect GM Financial dividends to moderate as earnings normalize and we continue to grow the asset base. Corp EBIT-adjusted in Q4 was down year-over-year by about $0.5 billion, driven by the non-recurrence of mark-to-market gains recognized in Q4 2020. Now, turning to our outlook for 2022. Today, we see a stabilizing semiconductor environment and envision wholesale getting to a normalized run rate towards the beginning of the third quarter with a target of around 800,000 units in North America on a quarterly basis. We expect total company volume to increase 25% to 30% year-over-year, with the majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year, primarily due to the production constraints in the second half of 2021. Sequentially, we expect the positive trend to continue, with Q1 wholesale volumes up 20% to 25% versus Q4 2021. In 2022, we anticipate light industry sales of approximately 16 million units, dealer stock to remain tight, and the dynamic where production is the gating factor for sales volumes continuing into 2022. As you think about the mix of this incremental volume, remember that in 2021, we largely protected our high-demand truck production. As a result, the incremental volume in 2022 will be mostly weighted towards small and midsized SUVs and sedan. Now, let's turn to our expectations for growth investments in margins. We're at a very important stage in the growth and development of some of our key businesses, and we are taking the very intentional step of investing heavily into them to accelerate our expansion. Cruise expenses are expected to commercialization and hire around 500 additional employees, increasing their workforce by around 20% to advanced technology as well as accelerate the operational infrastructure to grow and expand. We also expect to see some wage rate pressure as we continue to attract top talent to the company. Corporate expenses are expected to increase by approximately $0.5 billion as we expand the BrightDrop business, including product development and manufacturing spend to prepare the CAMI facility for ELCV production later in the year, and expanding customer pilots for the EP1 electric car, which we expect will drive software and services recurring revenue opportunities. We're going to continue to roll out OnStar Insurance across the country. We're in 46 states today and expect to be in all 50 by the second quarter. We're going to develop new products at GM Defense and continue to incubate new ideas to drive incremental growth and value in the future. We're also expecting to invest another $1.5 billion in expenses to expand software development and further accelerate our EV portfolio, which includes close to $1 billion of incremental engineering and software-related development. These investments are building the foundation to grow and accelerate our AV, EV, and software businesses as we aggressively launch approximately 20 EV products in North America and more than 30 EV products globally through 2025 and introduce Ultifi. These investments will also drive meaningful revenue growth starting in 2023 initially from EVs, BrightDrop and Cruise, but expanding the software and services as we launch Ultifi and grow other new business opportunities such as OnStar Insurance and GM Defense in the next few years. We're now also expecting commodities and logistics cost pressure of $2.5 billion year-over-year, primarily weighted to the front half of 2022. From a non-operating perspective, we expect a combined $1 billion year-over-year headwind from the non-recurrence of mark-to-market gains we achieved in 2021 and a reduction in net pension income as we further de-risk the planned asset profile. I want to reiterate that, despite all of this, we expect to generate 10% North America EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022, inclusive of the increased expenditures related to our growth investments and highlighting our ability to fund these initiatives through internally generated cash flow. In China, we expect equity income from our joint ventures to exceed $1 billion and remain relatively flat year-over-year. We anticipate a modest increase in volume, which will be offset by a more normalized mix, competitive pricing environment and increased investments as we prepare to bring more EV products to market. We expect GM Financial performance to be in the $3.5 billion to $4 billion range as we do not expect a repeat of some of the 2021 allowance releases, and we anticipate that credit performance in used vehicle prices will begin to moderate. Assuming continued steady demand for new vehicles, no significant new economic or supply chain challenges in 2022, we expect EBIT adjusted in the $13 billion to $15 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $6.25 to $7.25 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $7 billion to $9 billion rate. Adjusted automotive free cash flow will be driven by strong earnings and working capital rewind as volumes increased. We expect capital spend to be in the $9 billion to $10 billion range in 2022, including investments in our Ultium battery cell JVs, and expect similar levels of spending over the next several years. In summary, we had a strong finish to the year, and our results are a reflection of the team's focus and execution in the face of the continued challenging environment. In 2022, we expect strong commercial performance, and we are aggressively reinvesting some of our short-term EBIT improvement to accelerate our EV, AV journey, while still driving similar results to our record performance in 2021. This demonstrates the strength of our underlying business, the strength of our truck and SUV franchises, our industry-leading customer loyalty and world-class manufacturing and design capabilities. We will continue to leverage these competitive advantages as we vastly expand our battery cell and EV assembly capacity in North America to lead the industry. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. Congratulations on these results and the outlook. I'll ask two questions. First, just a financial one for Mary and Paul, you guys have almost $22 billion of cash. Your U.S. pension is now about fully funded. You've got $40 billion of liquidity, and you've shown a lot of resiliency in different financial conditions and operating conditions and are talking about $7 billion to $9 billion of free cash next year. So that's going to lead to some speculation on where the \u2013 these investments could be that \u2013 that you're contemplating instead of cash returns. So can you maybe talk about, are there investments that you're thinking about that are large enough that would consume cash of that magnitude? Mary Barra : So Rod \u2013 hi, thanks for the question. And as we look at it, we're going to follow the capital allocation framework that we're going to continue to invest in opportunities that allow us to generate returns -- return on invested capital of greater than 20%, maintain an investment-grade balance sheet and then return the balance to shareholders. We talked about a lot of pull ahead and acceleration to our EV strategy. And as we work through that, we will follow that. We'll look for those good investments, and then we'll follow the capital allocation framework. So think in February, it's a little early to look at that, but we'll provide more guidance through the year on that. Rod Lache : Okay. And I was hoping to ask a question to Kyle. So you're currently -- congratulations, by the way, on the milestones that you've achieved. And these operations look pretty impressive. Can you talk a little bit about what the operations look like in prime time? So during the day, more congested periods. And 2021 seems like it's kind of a step between R&D and commercialization. Can you maybe give us a little bit more of a sense of what commercial scale will look like and what kind of pace of expansion we should be thinking about? At one point, you were talking about, I think, a new city every six months, something along those lines. But any update on that? Kyle Vogt : Hi Rod, thanks for the question. Yes, it has been a very eventful day for us and a really good 2021 as we enter early commercialization. Our approach to bringing driverless cars to dense urban environments has been a cautious and careful one. We're starting with limited hours of the day, limited geofence. And what we're looking to do is, confirm that the performance and functionality of our system matches expectations and also that we give the communities where we're operating a little bit of time to acclimate, especially San Francisco, which is the first one -- first in urban environment that's ever experienced this. So we're going slowly and cautiously. But as we see things click and evidence that performance is meeting expectations, the focus becomes exactly what you mentioned, which is how quickly can we expand this to cover larger service area, more hours, serve more customers in San Francisco, but then cities beyond that. And so, we've been developing the foundational technologies to do those expansions in the background, and we've learned a lot by our operation in other cities like Arizona -- or sorry, in Arizona and in Michigan. So, we have a pretty good idea of what's around the corner, but we're gated by safety, and we're just in the very early days. So it's hard to know our exact rate of expansion. Rod Lache : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good afternoon, everybody. Just a first question, it's just on the core business. When we think about the 25% to 30% increase in wholesale, I imagine that mimics production. I'm just curious, as you think about that in the context of a 16 million unit SAAR, it seems like there will be some inventory build, but not a lot. So if you wind that together with CarBravo, it does seem like you're pushing to keep ATPs high -- mix relatively high and maybe transition some of your entry-level buyers or entry-level product into the used car market, which supports resist [ph] more structurally going forward. It just seems like you're getting a very good circular reference, keeping a lid on inventory, and then winding it up with CarBravo. I mean, what is the real opportunity here on CarBravo? And then ultimately, what could it mean for sort of this inventory management on the new vehicle side? Just seems like it's a very intertwined, very positive story? Paul Jacobson : Hey John, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. What I would say that for 2022, it's largely more of a function of what we continue to believe is large pent-up demand for new vehicles that hasn't been met in 2021 because of some of the production challenges. Certainly, what we saw as we were able to complete those vehicles, there was a little bit more going through the system of production. And as we talked about in the prepared remarks, those vehicles continue to sell very, very rapidly. So, despite the production increases we saw in Q4, we're still not really building inventory that much. And I think that's going to probably continue throughout the year with largely showing up in transit rather than on lot. That's really on the consumer, and I think that's the short-term. When you think about CarBravo, I would think about it in terms of the volume and the access to inventory that we have through GM Financial, through the dealer network. It really is unprecedented level that gives customers much, much better choice and variety across the country. And we can do this in a coordinated fashion largely because of where we are with vehicles coming off lease, the GM Financial inventory across the board. So, we actually see this as a really, really strong opportunity in and of itself to expand the customer relationship and the entire sort of universe of the customer that we're working through, and we talked about at Investor Day. John Murphy : Okay. And then just to follow-up on that. I mean it seems that you're tightening up and growing the core to drive more profits to fund the future, this Cruise news today -- and I'll sort of add my congratulations, too, on that to everybody on the team. As you grow in San Francisco and then repopulate the strategy in other markets, I mean, how do we think about the fleet and the capital required there to kind of follow-up on Rod's question? I mean, could there be a huge call on capital could actually have very good returns? And what is the earnings potential in that $50 billion? I got to mention the margin is much higher than the core business at 10%. So I mean how should we think about those earnings in 2030? So, capital requirement, will you own the fleet and where the earnings go? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Keep in mind, John, that we announced last year that GM Financial has committed to a $5 billion line of credit to help finance the Origin. So, I think when we look at capital for expansion as well as for the continued development, we're not seeing any constraints in that at all. Cruise is very well capitalized. They're very well prepared for the expansion phase as they continue to roll this out and achieve their milestones. John Murphy : I'm sorry. And the profitability potential on this? I mean it just seems like 10%, $5 billion is just an opening bid. It's probably a tremendous amount higher than that. I mean what do you roughly think in run rate of that profitability? Mary Barra : John, I think as we look, we see there's a huge first-mover opportunity to go and provide an exceptional customer experience. And so we're going to -- we do think there's tremendous margin potential in this business, but we also think growth is really important. So, you'll see us balance that in the early days to really get a foothold -- a solid foothold in a leadership position. So, down the road, we see tremendous profit, but we're going to really -- we're going to scale fast. John Murphy : Seems like a huge opportunity. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joe Spak : Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate the update on the Lordstown and Springhill Ultium cells build out and when those are starting. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of either from a run rate basis or maybe just an absolute basis where you think each of those -- or how long it's going to take those facilities to get up to their stated capacity. And then maybe just a quick aside, like if \u2013 it sounds opening mid-2022, where are you actually getting Ultium cells for the HUMMER, the BrightDrop and the LYRIQ? Mary Barra : Today, we're getting those from LG. But as we look, we're going to ramp up those plants as quickly as we can with one coming online on 2022, one on 2023 and then one late 2024 and one yet to be announced. So we're going to accelerate those as fast as we can. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've already found ways to add capacity from an operating perspective and efficiencies in the plant. So we're just going to keep going full out because we see the opportunity for substantial EV volume growth in this period of time. Joe Spak : Okay. And then I guess following up on that, and I know you've mentioned in your remarks, Mary, you're not don't really think you're constrained by your cell supply here. But it does seem like you have at least over the next year or so maybe an allocation decision of what programs those cells go to. So for instance, in 2023, you have both the Silverado and Equinox. So how do you go about deciding that, whether it sort of goes towards potentially a more profitable vehicle or a segment where you see less competition and more potential white space? Mary Barra : Well, I think we\u2019re working to expand our capability to accelerate all of those models. As I said, we're just seeing such strong demand, and that's caused the team to really go back and look and say, okay, let's double down and go faster from an acceleration perspective. Clearly, the cells will be something that we'll look to grow as well. One of the reasons why we're announcing the battery plant that we already did in Michigan, and we'll shortly be announcing the fourth battery plant, as well as continuing to work with LG. So we're focused right now not on trade-offs, but on enabling as many as we can during this period of time. And you heard me say that between 2022 and 2023, we want to \u2013 our plan is to have over 400,000 EVs into market in North America. And we're just going to keep working to improve that. And I have a lot of confidence in the GM team that when you give them a clear challenge, they rise to the occasion. Joe Spak : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. I had a question about the EV models and implied volume per SKU. I guess, I ask it like this, if you were starting an EV company from scratch, would you launch 30 different models over a three or four-year period? I understand, why \u2013 I guess, I understand why GM with the brands in different regions and things attempted to do it. But if you had the alternative \u2013 if you consider the alternative higher volume, maybe hundreds and hundreds of thousands of units per model, but a small number of models? Mary Barra : So Adam, we're going to go for both. And from a General Motors perspective, I think when you look at how we've approached the technology and the investments we've made in Ultium and how we're looking at the portfolio, a full portfolio, because again, if you look at \u2013 and by the way, we think several of those models are going to be over 100,000 units or more than that as we do that. So I really would say, Adam, we're going for both. And it's one thing when you're looking at the market when it's 2%, 3%, 5%. We're looking by 2030 to be in the 40% to 50% adoption and to do that, you've got to meet the customer where they're at. And that's why you look at the Equinox and how significant that can be, the more affordable EV that we're going to be doing that really gets into another very important part of the market. So you have to have the proper market coverage. Otherwise, the customer is going to have to make trade-offs. And because of GM's capability -- at General Motors at any one point in time, we have almost 100 programs in flight, meaning in concept to being launched. That's the capability the GM team has. So we're moving with the speed of a start-up with, I think, industry-leading technology in a platform, but we're also then leveraging the capability that GM has to attract and gain share and grow because of the vehicles that we'll have that meet their needs. Adam Jonas : Thanks Mary. Just as a follow-up, how certain are you that the quality problems that you had with your battery partner have been resolved? Obviously, you're implying there's some improvement. But could you tell us are all the issues behind you, or are there still some issues that you're working through in real time? Thanks. Mary Barra : Sure. So Adam, we're already putting new battery packs into existing Bolt EVs and EUVs. We wouldn't be doing that if we didn't have confidence. The LG technical team and the GM team have worked together, we believe, as we said before, that it was very rare manufacturing defects that caused the issue. And if you look at the low number of issues we had yet the, the extraordinary action that we took with recalling the entire population, that's our commitment to safety. And so we have found the issues. We've put a lot more robust processes into the manufacturing process and change the way the processing is to make sure we don't have that issue. I'd also note that, that was rich learnings that we had from our LG partners that have been incorporated into Ultium. So again, the experience that we've had of selling Bolt EVs for a while in Bolt EUVs, all of that learning is translated in -- and gives me great confidence in the quality of the Ultium platform and the packs that we're putting into the Bolt EVs and EUVs right now. Adam Jonas : Thanks Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks Adam. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Just 2 questions. Maybe first going back to AUV from Mary and Kyle. And Mary, I think in the past, you referred to the opportunity in personal consumer AV as upside potential to your 2030 target. I was hoping you could update us on the vision you have for consumers AV at GM as well as Cruise's role within that in the long run? Mary Barra : Well, for right now, with the significant announcement that Cruise made today, we want the team like 99.9% focused on making sure that we see the significant opportunity in rideshare and rideshare delivery. And we said most recently at the end of last year that we see -- and at CES that we see the opportunity for potentially as early as mid-decade to have personal autonomous vehicles, which is really an additive thing for Cruise because it puts more nodes on the network. It opens up another market. So we're very focused on rideshare and rideshare delivery. So this is something that we see potentially in mid-decade that we can make both businesses grow. So a huge opportunity. I don't know, Kyle, if you want to add anything? Kyle Vogt : Yes. Thanks, Mary. It's a natural fit like retail AV with increased total volume of sensors and compute systems we're building. It's more vehicles that are on our common platforms that power these fleets of driverless cars. So it drives down the cost on a unit basis and really reinforces and bolsters the core robotaxi business. So, we see it as really a win-win situation where it improves the economics of the robo taxi business, but also enables a new market and the expansion of the positive impact from this technology. Itay Michaeli : That's very, very helpful. Maybe a quick follow-up maybe for Paul. Hoping you could dimension the from the refreshed full-size pickup trucks, I think, are coming in the spring, both in terms of maybe pricing opportunities with the new content as well as any opportunities with the upgraded electrical architecture. Paul Jacobson : Thanks Itay. What I would say is that what we see right now and what we continue to see is a really, really strong consumer preference, especially as they're buying up on features and amenities. We see that across the board in in the Denali brands, high-country brands, et cetera, that I think it's going to continue to pay big dividends for us as we roll out the new vehicles going forward. So, without getting into specifics on vehicle margins and profitability, we're very excited about what that's going to bring and we think that the consumer is going to be really, really positive around them. Itay Michaeli : Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. Two questions, please. The first one, could you please describe the current supply chain environment? Any constraints still left on the chip availability? And in particular, I'd be interested to hear what gives you confidence that you would have sufficient chip availability to produce 25% to 30% more vehicle in 2022 versus 2021. Admittedly, you were hit maybe a bit harder than other players, but obviously, this is a nice size bounce back? Mary Barra : Yes. Emmanuel, thanks for the question. What we're sharing is what we see with the work that we've done with all of the semiconductor manufacturers and our plans for this year. So, of course, and Paul said, if there's significant COVID disruptions or other natural disasters, that could have an impact. But we're pretty -- we're seeing -- definitely seeing improvement in first quarter over fourth quarter. We saw fourth quarter better than third quarter. And we really see with the plans we have in place now, by the time we get to third and fourth quarter, we're going to be really starting to see the semiconductor constraints diminish. So, that's what we're working to achieve across all of our platforms and across the globe, frankly, with all of our suppliers, but that's our best current outlook that we're sharing. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Just a quick aside on this and then I have a second question on the Cruise. But just a clarification, the 25% to 30%, you're confident you could do this in North America since I think for China, I think Paul said that you were looking probably at more stable volume year-over-year? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Emmanuel, 25% to 30% is a global production number. So there's some in the US, and there's some in the GM international as well. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And then second question would be on Cruise. Mary, what are your current thoughts on optimal timing to bring this to capital markets, not just because of growing capital needs with the commercialization, which seems like you have that already well in place, but also as a way to potentially unlock some additional value for shareholders? Mary Barra : Yes. Emmanuel, I have always said and the belief that's held by, I'd say, the Cruise Board and the GM Board that we're going to do what's in the best interest of shareholders to create long-term value. And we do see that a capital raise event is something that we need in the near term. We're \u2013 Cruise is well capitalized and has strong financial support from its investors. GM is well funded. And so we don't really think we need to raise additional funds at this time. We also are committed to making sure we have competitive compensation packages at Cruise to attract and retain the best and the brightest talent to achieve the objectives and our growth initiatives here. So my answer would be we're always going to look and do what's in the best interest. But as we look now, we're in the first chapter, and there's still so much that can be accomplished with a frictionless environment between Cruise and GM. And that's what we're really focused is getting the technology out safely and then really growing at a pace where we can have leadership. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first, just a question for you, Paul, on the parameters of the guidance, EBIT guidance. I know you haven't articulated guidance by segment. There are some details there. But just given the comments for wholesale is up 25% to 30%, and you're reaffirming the 10% GM North America margin guide, even after factoring in the GMF decline and the higher spend for software and Cruise, I guess, I'm wondering how you reconcile to having that lower half of the guidance, because it seems like with that 10% North America margin guidance alone and that 25% to 30% volume growth, it pretty easily gets you to the upper half of the guidance. So in what scenario would you get to that lower half of the guide, or is that just conservatism for the unknown unknowns? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Hi, Dan, thanks for the question. What I would say is this is very much a midpoint convention guide as we're thinking this. Obviously, we've expanded the range over prior years, which I think is a reflection of the volatility that we've seen in the place. I would be careful about extrapolating too much across kind of the profitability from the incremental vehicles as we talked about and very intentional in the prepared remarks, a lot of that incremental volume is coming in at a lower contribution than what we've seen from the full-size trucks and SUVs going forward. That's just where the capacity is for us going forward. So what I would say is, with a really robust consumer and a strong continued environment, we would probably trend towards the high end of that. But we have a lot of volatility. So to the extent that we see consumer weakness, we see more supply chain pressure, we see more disruption in the global logistics platform that impacts production, then we could be at the lower end of the number. But we wanted to give a range that was focused around the midpoint of our expectation, as well as gave some comfort and some deference to the volatility that we see. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then second, Mary, maybe just a question on Ultium. I'd like to revisit the platform and the benefits. So if we go to EV Silverado, and I know you haven't unveiled the full set of specs, but one question, which has come up in the investor community is that on some of the metrics relative to the other competition that's out there, it's not showing the type of advantage of your competitors that maybe some had anticipated. So maybe we can just zoom out. And I think as you're launching the Ultium vehicles, what are the benefits that we're going to see versus your competitors? Is it just these going to be more profitable vehicles? Is it that, it's going to show up in other areas of battery efficiency? Is it that this can help unlock more range that others can't have? So what are the benefits of Ultium that we're going to start to see within the vehicle on a more of a, call it, metric basis? Mary Barra : Yes. Well, so I mean I think when we look at what Ultium is providing, first of all, it's going to give us scale. And we do think as we get the full portfolio of Ultium launch, we're going to see that scale, and it's going to give us an advantage from a -- from an overall margin perspective. But specifically for the Silverado EV, leveraging Ultium, we have longer range, 400-plus miles, faster charging, better towing capability. And I think you have to really look at this as opposed to -- I know there's been some focus on the miles per kilowatt hour, and we haven't put all the specs out and it's going to get a very -- with a lot of features that you choose, I mean, we very carefully look to say, what are we going to provide for the customer? What does the customer want in this segment? What's important to them? And when you look at more range, faster charging, more -- this is more capability in the real world, then when you look at the Ultium platform, also, it gives us the opportunity to have a mid-gate, which gives much more flexibility, also being able to drive these trucks that people are going to see the benefit of a fully integrated battery pack and body structure, which gives us a mass advantage as well as, we think, superior vehicle dynamics. So -- and then from an Ultium perspective, the other thing I would say as it relates to the truck portfolio, it's going to give us an opportunity to have a full truck portfolio faster. And as we've seen over the last couple of years, think about when we rolled out this current generation of trucks, we went high feature and high value. And we've grown our truck share capability. So, we know that truck customer, there's some that want high value, some that want high feature. Ultium is going to give us the opportunity to again delight the customer with what they're specifically looking for as opposed to 1 or 2 point solutions off of a retrofitted platform. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted -- sorry, I hope it's not too I just want to clarify on the Cruise announcement, people are able to sign up on the wait list. Does that mean you're actually going to be able to do it soon, or is it like today, or is that like you're on a waitlist? And then in a couple of months, they're able to actually start taking rides? Any -- I just want to clarify that it's kind of felt like it might have been today. And then I assume that means you have that sort of final license I think you talked about that you needed in San Francisco to deploy? Paul Jacobson : Hi Colin, thanks for the question. So the waitlist is open. And based on the early demand we saw this morning, there's going to be a pretty long list pretty quickly. And we are starting small with a limited number of vehicles, limited hours. And so I don't think we're going to be able to get to everyone on that list in the next week or 2. And so it could be some time before people on the waitlist get to use the product. But we are -- we have already started carrying members of the public, and we're working through that waitlist now, adding new people every day. The other part of your question, I'm sorry? Colin Langan : I think that answers it. I assume then you got that last license, I think you had mentioned. Paul Jacobson : Yes. On the permit, we still have 5 out of the 6 necessary permits to operate a fared rideshare service. So as of today, all of the rides are free. And we filed the last -- the application for the last remaining permit in November last year, and we continue to work with the CPUC, California Public Utilities Commission, and answer questions they have about that application as they pop up. So stay tuned for more news on that. Colin Langan : Okay, that is helpful. Thank you. And then just I wanted to follow up on the 25 to 30 -- again, sorry. Other automakers are announcing cuts, so it's a bit surprising. I mean what kind of line of sight do you have? I mean is it just you have maybe bigger buffer stock now, that you're maybe more able to swap out some of these chips? So just feels a little risky considering it seems to have been surprised over the last year that the supply wasn't there. And it seems like a very fragile semi pipeline, it seems. Any sort of visibility there that you could provide? Mary Barra : Well, again, as I said, we have been working closely with our supply base with the Tier 1s as well as the semiconductors. We said last year that we were going to work deep into the tiered base and understand the capabilities. We were hit pretty hard last year third quarter with Malaysia because it just so happened that the facilities that have a lot of GM business happened to be hard hit by COVID, and you saw the losses we suffered there. So, I think that's a bit of it. But this is our best estimate with the detailed work that we've been doing all last year and this year. Now, we still get surprises and then we work to solve those issues either with an engineering solution or making trade-offs between vehicles. We believe we're going to continue to do that. But what we're sharing with you is based on everything we know today, based on the commitments of the supply base and barring some major COVID disruption or some major natural disasters, supply chain disruption, this is what we think we're going to be able to do. Paul Jacobson : And Colin, if I can just add to that. I think understand some of the skepticism, especially based on the volatility and where others are going forward. But this is why we wanted to add the point in there about where we see Q1. We're coming off of a lower baseline in the second half of the year, largely because of the impact that Mary mentioned. But the run rate that we've seen sequentially from 3Q to 4Q to 1Q is giving us a heightened level of confidence. It doesn't mean that things won't pop up. But certainly, what we're seeing in the very, very near term is giving us a little bit more confidence. And I think the general consensus is that things will be more stable in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. So that's kind of how we're extrapolating our expectations. Colin Langan : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for all the color on 2022 outlook including relative to both volume and pricing. I'm curious for your thoughts on mix in 2202. So, for example, as chip supply continues to hopefully normalize, does that mean you may produce more modestly priced or lower trim model vehicles, including for rental customers, et cetera? What's the right way to think about how much of the much richer mix has been supply-driven with automakers, including yourselves opting to produce only higher-end vehicles, and so it could maybe unwind versus how much of the much richer mix is maybe more sustainable demand-driven, for example, with consumers increasingly demanding these high-end features? What do you think? Paul Jacobson : Well, thanks for the question, Ryan. I think we continue to just see and have talked all through 2021 about the strength of the consumer and the strength of the new models, especially in the full-size trucks and SUVs and how customers were buying up for them. So that -- there's nothing that's changed underlying in the consumer from that standpoint, The comment that we made in the prepared remarks was largely a function of the increased volume because we were running full out on a lot of the full-size trucks and SUVs. There really a lot of the unmet production or underutilized production or underutilized production that was hit in 2021 was in the crossover smaller SUVs and sedans. So by definition, that's where a lot of the production increases and volume increases are going to be in 2022. I don't think that that changes mix. We're going to see \u2013 continue to watch that with the consumer going through 2022, and it's something that we can adjust on the fly as we see that going forward. But no reason to believe that, the strength of the consumer is deteriorating from what we saw in 2021. Mary Barra : And the only thing I'd add, Paul, is that when you look at the new full-size trucks, with the enhancements that we've made, and frankly, even offering some further up-level models, I think that's just another huge opportunity for us. So I think this is going to be a positive year for that. And again, we focus on those vehicles that we have no \u2013 we're already running full out. So we have no capacity to make up, which kind of puts a little more color onto what Paul said about where the opportunity to add this year is. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you, both. And just lastly, maybe a related follow-up question on if there might now be a new normal that you see in terms of US industry sales. We used to say that normalized US demand was around 17 million. And sales did average around $17 million for a long time, but that was also when vehicles cost $30,000 or $35,000 versus now they're more like $40,000 or $45,000. So just curious if you have any updated thoughts on any new normal in terms of sales and pricing et cetera. Mary Barra : I don't know, if there's anything normal right now, when you look at all of the challenges that the industry is still facing. As Paul said, we think we've got a large pent-up demand especially for GM vehicles and strong full-size trucks coming out. We continue to see just incredibly strong demand for our full-size SUVs and midsize crossovers. So I think it's too early to declare normal when we're still impacted by the semiconductor shortage. They're still buying behavior as an outcome of COVID and some of the support that was provided. So I think it's going to take a little while before we declare normal. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : For our last question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Your line is open. Stephen Hunt : Yes. Hi, team. It's Stephen Hunt on for Brian. Just two questions here from us. In terms of the kind of consolidating the semiconductor purchasing the three families and the co-development, I guess, where do we stand on that? And then what's the kind of most expected time frame when that could add to incremental chip supply? Mary Barra : Yeah. That's a midterm type of solution. Clearly, it's full speed ahead of working with the partners that we announced and getting to the families. And so reducing complexity, which we think will allow us to secure supply in addition to the relationships that we're creating with these strategic partners. But that's a midterm solution, not a short-term solution. Stephen Hunt : Okay. And then I guess a somewhat related question. In terms of the long-term margin target laid out at the capital Markets Day, 12% to 14% margins. It looks like as we go into 2022 overall, there's a decent amount of step-up in investment for some of these related businesses. I guess the move out to 2030, should we be expecting kind of a directional linear move towards that 12% to 14%, or should we be expecting some years to be kind of flattish or even potentially down as we shift out of facing the buzz and bring on new businesses? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Stephen, it's Paul. So what I would say is it's a little bit lumpy between now and then because if you think about the trajectory, the number one priority and foundation that we're building is getting the EV fleet out there. So you're going to see a lot of the revenue growth really driven by EVs over the next few years. And as you get into the latter half of the decade, and you've got the Ultifi platform out there and growing that foundation through electric vehicles, you're going to start to see what we think is going to be a pretty quick ramp-up in the software. So the revenue growth is going to be a little bit more steady, especially as we look at what Cruise is doing going forward. The margin performance is probably -- lags a little bit because some of the higher margin revenue opportunities from software and the connected vehicles are going to be -- are going to come after we get that foundation built in the latter part of the decade. Stephen Hunt : Okay. Understood. Thanks for taking the question. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Thanks, Jordan, and thanks, everybody, for your questions. I want to close again by thanking the GM team broadly, including the GMF team, our union partners, our dealers and our suppliers. The work that they did together, seizing opportunities, addressing challenges is what allowed us to have this record performance. And we take that collaboration and problem solving agility and resiliency into 2022, and we apply that to continuing to accelerate our EV transformation, the work in software and, of course, supporting our Cruise company as well. So I couldn't be more excited about 2022 and what the year and how it can unfold. I hope you see and you see the clear sense of determination that we have, and we will move even faster to deliver on our commitments and achieve the growth that we know is right in front of us. So, I want to assure you that we'll keep you updated every step of the way, but '22 is going to be an exciting year. Thank you. Operator : That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, April 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Ashish Kohli : Thanks, Sue. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this afternoon and are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson. GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. In addition, Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and welcome to General Motors, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, my remarks will focus on the ways in which the disciplined approach to our transformation is fueling momentum that will establish General Motors as an EV and AV leader across our product portfolio, our patented LTM platform and our supply chain in addition to other initiatives. But I want to begin by thanking our employees, our dealers, our suppliers and our unions for helping us deliver yet another strong quarter, a clear measure of the momentum we have. Our strong earnings in the first quarter were very similar to a year ago, and they show that we deliver on our commitments. Going forward, we have many revenue and cost opportunities to deliver our full year guidance, which we are affirming today. Last quarter, we discussed our plans to launch more EVs faster, because they are catalysts for our growth. We have been very deliberate in our approach to get EVs right and to get solutions that are scalable and position us for leadership in key segments like pickups, luxury and affordable EVs, and deliver programs and services that support margin expansion. This includes the dedicated EV engineering group we formed in 2019 to develop the Ultium platform, the software organization that we brought together and when we created that same year to generate more reoccurring revenue by leveraging connectivity and the foundation of that is our vehicle intelligence platform and now Ultifi. The EV growth organization we formed in 2020 to focus on the consumer experience and to take out inefficiencies of our distribution system; the three battery plants we are opening in the United States between this summer and 2024, with the fourth plant to be announced shortly; the creation of a sustainable, scalable and North America-focused EV supply chain to control our own destiny; and a manufacturing plan that leverages our talent and our scale, including the existing plants like Factory ZERO, Spring Hill, CAMI and Orion; and also our close partnership with Honda, which includes both EVs and AVs. We are now in a rapid launch cycle, because of the investments we've made over the last several years. Taking these steps has allowed us to establish an unparalleled foundation on which to execute and scale. Because of this, our drive to produce 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of 2022 and 2023 is underway. For example, in the short span of time, the Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac brands will launch six high-volume EV products into luxury, SUV and truck segments, all enabled by Ultium. We are also working on a fully electric Corvette, as Mark shared yesterday, as well as an electrified Corvette that will arrive next year, and I have to tell you the response has been overwhelming. So by the end of 2025, we will have installed capacity to build 1 million EVs in North America, representing approximately $50 billion in annual revenue. And we will have three EV programs in North America, each with annual production volumes of more than 125,000 units, with opportunities to expand. This is a great start toward delivering our $90 billion of EV revenue by 2030. Cadillac will be our first all-electric brand, and its journey began last month with the production launch of the LYRIQ. Unlike all of our EV entries to date, the response has been very strong. We began taking orders for the full -- we will begin taking orders for the full range of LYRIQ models on May 19, and production at Spring Hill will accelerate through the second half of the year and into 2023. And I have to tell you, I was at the plant last week and the LYRIQ looks absolutely great. We will also have more affordable models that will be a major source of growth for Chevrolet and Buick. We are quickly regaining momentum with the Bolt EV and EUV now that production has resumed. In fact, we plan to produce more than 50,000 Bolt EVs this year for global markets, including a record 40,000 deliveries in the US. The first high-volume Ultium-based SUVs for Chevrolet will launch next year. Chevrolet has already previewed the all-electric Blazer SS, its first fully electric SS model. We'll reveal the full vehicle in July, and it goes into production mid next year. In early fall, we will reveal the Equinox EV, and the launch is scheduled just after the Blazer EV. With a starting price of around 30,000 MSRP, the Equinox EV is a true white space opportunity for us, since most affordable EVs from Chevy's competitors start at $40,000 or more. Of course, our biggest growth opportunity in North America is in trucks. We have led the industry in full-size pickup sales for the last two years, and we will lead in EV pickups as well. We'll do it by leveraging the capability and flexibility of our purpose-built LTM platform and decades of truck design and engineering expertise, as well as extensive customer insights. The GMC HUMMER EV pickup is just the beginning. People who have driven the HUMMER EV confirm it is a super truck. One media influencer said, you somehow mixed the Raptor, TRx, Bronco and Wrangler all in one package, made electric and better than all of them. We agree. March was our best month for the HUMMER EV reservation since we unveiled the SUV a year ago. We now have more than 70,000 reservations for the pickup and SUV models, and we are accelerating production through 2022 and into 2023. You will see many of the HUMMER EV's best attributes available in the Chevrolet Silverado EV, including superior range, faster fast-charging capability, four-wheel steering, Super Cruise and a larger, far more flexible pickup cab and bed compared to our closest competitor. Just yesterday, we shared that Ultium vehicles, including the HUMMER EV and Silverado EV, have a new patented energy recovery system that uses heat from the battery packs to optimize range, performance, charging times and passenger comfort, without adding mass or cost. These are the kinds of Ultium platform innovations that are driving a surge in Silverado EV demand and are an example of the benefits of taking the time to establish a dedicated and scalable platform. We are now at 140,000 reservations and growing, including retail customers in nearly 400 fleet operators, up from 240 last quarter. Production of the Silverado EV will begin at Factory ZERO in Detroit-Hamtramck in just 11 months, followed by Orion Assembly in 2024. We will begin building preproduction Silverado EVs in a matter of weeks. The supply chain supporting our EV production will also be a competitive advantage for us. Our strategy is to control our own destiny. So we forge long-term strategic relationships. We have invested alongside industry leaders and startups alike, and we are sourcing as much as possible from North America and strong trading partners like Australia. This includes rare earth material, permanent magnets, cathode active material and lithium, as well as the cobalt agreement we announced this month with Glencore. We're also in the process of securing additional long-term supply agreements for nickel. Even as we scale our EV and AV businesses, which currently account for about 80% of our product capital spend, the earnings power of our ICE business will grow. In the first quarter, for example, we launched new versions of the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra. These trucks have new designs, technology and improved functionality, including a new 13.4-inch infotainment screen on most models, Super Cruise with hands-free trailering and new off-road and premium models like the Silverado ZR2 and the Sierra Denali Ultimate. To help meet demand, we will add a third shift at our Oshawa Assembly Plant during the summer to build both light-duty and heavy-duty models. At the same time, we are executing major reductions in complexity and engineering expense across our ICE portfolio. For example, we compressed the footprint for today's Equinox and Terrain from three to two plants, enabling us to create white space capacity for EV expansion. We also achieved about a 70% part sharing and reuse on these models, along with more than a 90% reduction in build combinations. We sharply reduce build combinations of the Silverado as well, and we're applying these significant cost avoidance strategies across all of our next-gen ICE programs. For example, our next-generation Traverse, Enclave and Acadia will have one-third fewer unique parts and launch with higher EBIT than today's models. I'd like to wrap up with an update on Cruise. During the quarter, we took the opportunity to increase our ownership position to approximately 80%, because we are extremely bullish on the team's rapid progress toward commercialization. As Kyle shared on our last call, Cruise continues to make great progress safely and deliberately, expanding its full driverless operations in San Francisco. Cruise is now operating in about 70% of the city and is moving toward operating 24/7 across the entire city by the end of this year. Already, the fleet has traveled about 40 times the distance from San Francisco to New York City, all in driverless mode and all in a highly complex environment. This includes several hundred rides for members of the public. We'll have more Cruise news to share as it completes a permitting process to charge for rights in San Francisco and as the Cruise Origin launch at Factory ZERO approaches. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Mary, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. We delivered a very strong first quarter, including over 10% year-over-year revenue growth, fueled by robust demand for our products, especially for our full-size trucks and SUVs. Our plants were largely running regular production, as the team worked to overcome semiconductor and other supply constraints. Strong customer demand for our products has continued into April, with most vehicles continuing to turn immediately as they arrive at dealers. As Mary highlighted, we've continued to take strategic actions designed to create long-term shareholder value and prioritize investments in EVs and AVs that will help accelerate our growth. In the case of Cruise, we utilized approximately $3.5 billion in cash to capitalize on an opportunity to increase our ownership percentage from just over 60% to approximately 80% at a very attractive private market valuation. Our increased ownership percentage in Cruise triggered a reconsolidation for income tax purposes and lowered our expected full year adjusted effective tax rate by 3 percentage points to approximately 20%. As a result, and to be transparent, we increased our full year EPS diluted adjusted guidance by $0.25 to address this. This transaction is directly in line with our capital allocation priorities to invest in businesses that drive outsized growth opportunities, given the tremendous long-term potential we see at Cruise. Now let's turn to Q1 results. We generated $36 billion in revenue, $4 billion in EBIT adjusted, 11.2% EBIT adjusted margin and $2.09 per share in EPS diluted adjusted. These results demonstrate the resiliency of the team and our ability to mitigate the impacts of higher commodity costs, as well as investments in our growth in EV transition. In fact, our results were similar to the first quarter of last year despite $2.5 billion in higher costs, highlighting the strength of our products and the demand environment. Sequentially, we saw growth in total company wholesale volumes of 12% from Q4, 2021. We recognize the consumer is facing inflationary pressures. However, we continue to see ongoing strong customer demand for our vehicles, including our refreshed full-size pickup trucks, as Mary mentioned. We were able to protect against significant plant downtime and the team worked effectively to minimize the impact of continued short-term disruptions from semiconductor and other challenges. Overall, we see the availability of semiconductors continuing to improve and are working closely with our supply chain partners to help deliver our full year total company wholesale volume goal of 25% to 30% growth. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was breakeven for the quarter, an improvement of $1.9 billion year-over-year, driven by favorable working capital, partially offset by higher CapEx and non-recurrence of a GM Financial dividend during the quarter. Now let's take a closer look at North America. In Q1, North America delivered EBIT adjusted of $3.1 billion, flat year-over-year, driven by strong pricing on our full-size trucks and SUVs, offset by higher commodity costs and investments in growth. We're also pleased to achieve EBIT-adjusted margins in North America of 10.7%, on track with our 2022 full year guidance of 10%. New vehicles have continued to turn very quickly, and US. dealer inventories remain tight at around 270,000 units, with much of this inventory in transit. That grounded inventory on dealer lots is less than 15 days. We continue to see ATP increases across our vehicle segments, including year-over-year increase of 10% for trucks and 20% for crossovers. While the first quarter presented challenges for commodity and logistics costs, our teams are working effectively to manage these dynamics. We have contractual protections in place for some commodities to help ensure supply and to provide some protection against cost volatility. We also made some proactive decisions early in the year to bolster our supply and provide pricing protection. For example, we secured palladium inventory that is sufficient to meet our production needs through the end of this year. Through these actions, our commodity and logistics headwinds year-over-year came in line with our expectations at around $1 billion in Q1. Consistent with prior guidance, we saw increased investments, primarily in engineering and software development resources, as we continue to vertically integrate to help drive revenue from our new hardware and software platforms. Now, let\u2019s move to GM International. GMI delivered first quarter EBIT adjusted of $300 million, results consistent with Q1, 2021. This included $200 million of equity income in China, down $100 million year-over-year, driven primarily by recent COVID impacts, partially offset by stabilization in pricing and continued cost actions. EBIT-adjusted in GMI, excluding China, was $100 million, up $100 million year-over-year, with results driven by both favorable volume, pricing and mix, partially offset by commodity and semiconductor impacts. We continue to see momentum in the international business, and I'm really proud of the work that the team has been doing. A few comments on GM Financial and corporate expenses. GM Financial delivered solid results again, driven by strong used vehicle prices and favorable credit performance, with Q1 EBT adjusted of $1.3 billion, up $100 million year-over-year. Used vehicle prices were modestly lower sequentially in Q1 to Q4, but we would not expect to see an impact unless used car values decline another 10% to 15% from current prices. Corporate expenses were $400 million in the quarter, almost exclusively driven by differences in year-over-year mark-to-market changes, which also includes the full year -- or the first quarter profitability for the whole company. Moving to Cruise. As I mentioned earlier, we captured an opportunity in Q1 to acquire additional shares in Cruise, and we also initiated a program to provide an ongoing liquidity opportunity for Cruise employees. The liquidity opportunity included a modification to existing equity awards to remove the requirement for liquidity event vesting, resulting in Cruise recognizing a $1.1 billion compensation expense in Q1 for the awards that would have previously reached their time vesting threshold. We treated this expense as special for purposes of EBIT adjusted, given the expense would have been recognized previously under the modified terms. Going forward, future stock compensation expenses at Cruise will be recognized over the vesting period in earnings. Inclusive of the incremental stock compensation expenses, we expect full year 20222 expenses at Cruise to be approximately $2 billion. Turning to our 2022 outlook for the calendar year. We have a number of tools at our disposal, as we've demonstrated, to help offset higher costs and are taking active steps to ensure that we deliver on our full year 2022 guidance range of EBIT adjusted of $13 billion to $15 billion and North American margins of 10%. We're utilizing similar strategies, as we have in the past, to offset these commodity and logistics cost which are currently projected to be approximately $2.5 billion higher than the $2.5 billion included in our original guidance earlier this year. These strategies include pricing actions, as well as holding additional inventory of key commodities to manage price and global trade volatility. And as Mary mentioned, we're also being proactive in finding cost efficiencies throughout the company. In summary, we're off to a good start to the year, and the team is laser-focused in a dynamic environment, while at the same time executing on the launch of the Cadillac LYRIQ, accelerating production of the GMC HUMMER EV and preparing for our future mass-market EV product launches. We are making the right long-term strategic decisions for the business, executing on our transformation that will support the long-term earnings power of the company and creating significant value for the shareholders. We are very optimistic about the future of the company and our vision of an all-electric future. I will now turn it back over to Mary for one last comment. Mary Barra : Thanks, Paul. Now I've said many times that the resiliency and creativity are drivers for our success, so is accountability. One reason why Cruise has accomplished so much so quickly is that, the team is inspired by its mission, and everyone has a financial stake in the company's success. The new equity compensation program Cruise created is designed to reinforce its culture and to help to continue to attract the best and the brightest talent. Paul said, it has been very well received and it will help keep everyone focused on the mission at hand. At GM, our compensation has always been driven by the company's success, and no one should doubt our commitment to lead in EVs or the passion our team has for that mission. That's why this is the right time to directly link a significant part of the long-term compensation for me and every other GM executive to meeting our EV goals. Starting this year, we have added metrics for EV volumes in North America, EV launch timing and EV launch quality to our existing EBIT margin and total shareholder return measures. The metrics are in place now, and they will appear in our proxy statement, which we'll file on April 29, but I wanted to share the news today to underscore our commitment to our EV future. Now Paul and I are happy to take your questions. Operator : A reminder to analysts, we are asking to limit your questions to one and brief follow-up, so that we may get to everyone on the call. Our first question comes from Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead. Joe Spak : Thanks for the time. Mary, in your letter, you astutely highlighted that EV supply chain is important to control your own destiny and you've made some important announcements here in lithium cobalt. It sounds like something is coming on nickel. Can you help us a little bit, though, on like the timing for those agreements? And assuming all goes to plan, like how much raw input is already secured for that 400,000 units over that 2022 to 2023 time frame? Mary Barra : So Joe, I'm not going to get into specific quantities. But what I would say is, with all the work that we're doing, we feel very confident that we're going to be able to hit the 400,000 between 2022 and 2023 and get to 1 million units in North America and an additional 1 million units in China by 2025, and we're even working on the 2026 to 2030 time frame, as we have pretty aggressive targets for our EV growth during that time. So, again, there's tremendous work that has gone on. It's been going on for well over a year, and we'll continue to announce things, not when we start working on them, but when have signed agreements. So, again, I think this will be a competitive advantage for General Motors. Joe Spak : On pricing, you talked about the strong pricing opportunity. I guess, I want to talk about pricing a little bit in the context of two different realms of your EV portfolio. First, is there scope, or -- and do you need to rethink pricing on the Silverado, given what we've seen on input costs? And then, second is, is the 30,000 Equinox EV, and I understand that's sort of an entry point, low-end trim, but is that even still possible in today's cost environment? Mary Barra : I think it is, Joe. I mean, we understand affordability for those customers, and we're going to work to work the equation work. The advantages that we have because of the scale that we're going to have, the continued work we do on improving the next-generation chemistries for Ultium, so we're not walking those prices back -- or up, I should say, I guess. Joe Spak : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just ask about inflation. And in North America, we're seeing levels of inflation that we haven't seen for decades. And I was hoping you might be able to just talk to us high level about how that affects GM's strategy over the intermediate term. Though, I see that you're expecting a 10% margin this year. As this kind of evolves and inventories normalize, rates go up, does this inflationary cost environment affect your ability to sustain this, or maybe just talk to us a little about how you're thinking about that. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Hey. Good evening, Rod. Thanks for the question. I think when you look at the track record of the company over the last couple of years, we've been able to pass through the inflationary pressures that we've seen to the customer. And that's really, I think, on the backs and the strength of the products that we've offered. Certainly, lower inventory levels have helped that in the short run. So I think, it's been a very good tool for us. I think, the billion-dollar question is, what happens when inflation is too much. And the thing we have to remember is these variables don't move independently. So in a world where we start to see inflation taking a toll on a consumer, you'd also expect there to be some reduction in commodity prices, et cetera, reflecting macro demand trends. So I think we're watching it very closely. And I think the message to take away from our first quarter performance, as well as going back through 2021, is the team\u2019s been very nimble and adept at managing through this. And that's the confidence that we have today, at least, as we've given our guidance revision or our guidance reaffirmation, sorry. Rod Lache : So just to clarify, is there any change going forward in the company's strategy, as you sort of anticipate that -- those effects on the consumer and rates going higher? And just as a follow-up, you had $2.2 billion of higher costs in North America in the quarter. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what was in that? It sounds like you had $1 billion of commodity and now its $5 billion for the year. You're seeing similar increases over the course of the year from supplier content costs? Paul Jacobson : Yes. I mean, this is all based on sort of current forward curves and our expectations on what we know today. And I'm not trying to evade your question, I'm just trying to simply state that, the world is very dynamic right now, right? So what we don't want to do is overreact to something that might not be here in six months or 12 months from now. So I think what we're doing and what the team has demonstrated, whether it's commercially or on the cost front, is we're doing the things necessary to hold the line in face of the pressure that we're seeing. So as long as we continue to do that, I don't think there's any change in the strategy of how we're executing that, and we feel comfortable with where we are right now. Mary Barra : Hey, Rod, the only other thing I would add, too, is we are seeing very strong demand for General Motors products. I mean, we have a new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra coming out, very focused with what the customer is looking for. We think that's going to continue to drive strong demand. And really across all of our products, whether it's the Trailblazer, all the way up to the full-size pickups and our midsized use as well. So I think we're going to continue to see, from a GM perspective, our product portfolio is very strong. Rod Lache : Okay. Thank you. And any color on just the supplier costs and whether those continue to increase from here? Mary Barra : So, from a supply base perspective, we continue to work with them. We have -- we understand that the supply base is being impacted by the current environment, and we're working with them in a very transparent manner to understand the specific impacts to their business. And then working together to identify efficiencies to help mitigate the headwinds or other measures that we have that we can take to make sure -- we need to make sure we keep a healthy and resilient supply base. So that's the work that we have been -- frankly, we do all the time, and we'll continue to do that with our suppliers. Rod Lache : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. You my go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. Mary, I want to just pick up on that last question, and this is just on the supply side. Maybe you could just walk us through the supply constraints and give us a sense of how to look at the different constraints out there? I think you mentioned semis, that's going to ease in the second half. Where are we on the semis? And then as far as the Tier 2s, we're hearing periodically of some challenges on the Tier 2. So maybe you can just talk through where the supply side is right now? And at what point we can expect for you to return to full run rate production? I think on the prior call, you mentioned that you'd be at full run rate production in the back half of the year. And also, if you could address if Europe poses a supply risk to you in any way? Mary Barra : So let me start with the last question. Because we don't have a presence in Europe, although, we do see that as a tremendous growth opportunity for our EV portfolio as we go forward, we aren't really seeing a lot of impact. We work with our suppliers and understanding their tiers to make sure. So our supply chain exposure from a European perspective, due to the tragic situation in the Ukraine is fairly limited, and we work to mitigate any of those risks. So that's from a Europe perspective. From a semiconductor, we are on track. We think we're going to see that 25% to 30% wholesale volume increase from last year to this year. And that will continue -- it will continue to get better, H2 being better than H1. I do see a trail into 2023 with semis, but I think we'll continue to mitigate that. There are -- there's other risks that we face on almost a daily or weekly basis with the supply chain that our team just continues to work and find solutions, find other sources. I couldn't be more pleased with the work that they're doing. So we'll continue that focus. And from a China perspective, we are seeing some -- what we think are green shoots with the government looking -- first of all, deeming automotive and the supply base to be essential and helping us find ways to keep production moving. And so, with that, we think we'll be -- our current look, if that is executed as it's been discussed, we think there's an opportunity that will mitigate those lockdowns, because we've really -- or mitigate the effects from the lockdowns, because it's been a minimal impact so far. We recognize the situation is dynamic, though, so we continue to monitor on a daily basis. So I guess, Dan, as I look overall, it's a very dynamic situation. There is some volatility with everything that's happening in the world, but we just try to get in front of it as quickly as we can and find solutions, which I think a proof point of us being able to do that is, the strong results we had in Q1. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. And then, the second question, Mary, I want to go back two one of your presentation from one of the conferences a couple of years ago. And I think you noted at that conference that you were on track for the vehicle development process to essentially be cut in half, going from, call it, four years to two years. I just want to ask if the EVs that you have in your portfolio and that are in your pipeline are tracking to this development pace? And to what extent we could potentially see accelerated time lines versus what you've announced? Or is there just a simple reality that, some of the supply constraints or the supply chain dynamics are still limiting the development time to time from which you conceive a product at the time that it's ready to start to ramp on production? Mary Barra : So, we delivered the HUMMER on time to what we said, and there were tremendous lessons learned. And I think this is the -- one of the benefits coming from having a dedicated EV platform and the way that it's a modular plug-and-play and the wireless battery control system that we are able to take time out of the VDP, our vehicle development process, already use the acronym. And so, that will -- we were able to, looking at that, pull the LYRIQ ahead nine months. And so, we're definitely looking at every learning that we have from that. And so it gives me confidence that we have shortened the time. Now going from -- taking almost half the time out, I'm not ready to sign up that we're going to go even quicker than that. And I'm not going to say that's a supply base issue. When you're developing an all-new vehicle and making sure it has the technology and that the customers expect, whether it's Super Cruise or everything from a connectivity and the upgradability that Ultifi will enable, I think, as we can continue on with the timing that we've demonstrated on HUMMER and the LYRIQ, and it -- I think that's -- that we're going to be focused. But that's going to allow us to have a pretty rapid clip of product launches, as you look at the HUMMER SUV is coming, the Silverado EV, the Equinox, the Blazer and the electrified Corvette. And I would say another enabler of that is, is our manufacturing transition and the ability that we're not starting from ground, with -- looking for a piece of property and then looking through the whole permitting process, we're transitioning our manufacturing footprint. And not only does that give us a timing advantage on turning the facility over, which we've now demonstrated with Factory ZERO and with Spring Hill, but also, we have a trained talented workforce that we're leveraging and is, again, based on my trip, I've been at a couple of our plants lately and they're super excited with the new products they're rolling out. So, I think, the speed that we've been able to bring EVs on, is something that will continue. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. The auto industry has been very successful at raising price in North America and at least, if not, more than offsetting some of the cost pressures. You mentioned in the call today, price being a potential tool to continue to offset increasing cost pressures that you're seeing this year. Can you talk about your confidence in being able to pass on higher prices to consumers, given some of the signs of weakness in consumer spending of late? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Hey, Mark. Thanks for the question. I think, as we've talked about, the demand that we see for our vehicles is quite strong, with most vehicles essentially being spoken for as soon as they deliver to the dealerships. And you see that in the fact that while production is up, grounded inventory remains quite low. So we've got really strong demand. I think, the new pickups are also a big piece of that going forward. So whether the confidence is in the data we see and whether that's unique to Good morning, because of the high quality of our products, we haven't seen any demonstrated weakness from that perspective going forward. We have to be nimble, though. And as I mentioned to an earlier question, we have to watch that balance between the strength of the consumer, as well as what we see in the input costs, et cetera, and making sure that we've got alignment on that. But as what the team has done is, we look at both go-to-market strategies, as well as cost reductions, and we've been targeting that. And I think the team has done a really good job. So we've got to be nimble and flexible. But right now, we see nothing but strength in the consumer and the demand for GM products. Mark Delaney : That's helpful, Paul. Thank you. And my other question was a follow-up on some of the comments you made about Cruise and the ability for employees to be able to monetize their holdings, even while Cruise is private. Do you have any more details you can share on that? Any data points in terms of employee retention or recruiting, given this ability for them to monetize their stakes? Thank you. Mary Barra : Yes. Kyle Vogt is on the phone. So I think, Kyle, if you'd like to take that question? Kyle Vogt : Sure. Thanks, Mary, and thanks, Mark, for the question. So, I guess, what you're getting at is, did this work? And the answer is unequivocally, yes. We've seen attrition go down substantially, even early this year to pre-COVID levels, which is really good. We also ran an engagement survey, and our engagement is up substantially compared to Q3 2021, the last time we measured it, and it was actually our largest jump ever. Career page visits are up substantially. And we have really favorable comments from existing employees and perhaps more importantly, candidates that are in the pipeline. So the reactions exceeded our expectations, and that's really what we hoped for, given that this was specifically targeted to help us attract the world's best talents can work on AVs, but also retain the great talent that we have. Mary Barra : All right. Thanks, Kyle. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Itay Michaeli with Citi. You may go ahead. Itay Michaeli : Yes. Great. Thanks. Good evening, everybody. So going back to pricing, maybe for Paul. I was hoping you can maybe help us to mention how much incremental pricing you're kind of modeling for the rest of the year relative to Q1. And within that, sort of how much -- is it sort of industry pricing strength, just from the supply-demand, the tightness you talked about relative to GM-specific pricing opportunities from some of your new products like the new trucks that you're rolling out? Because it does seem like you have some opportunity to narrow pricing gaps relative to segment averages? Just curious how much of that is playing into the outlook for the rest of the year? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks, Itay. Well, I won't get into any specific pricing strategies about the future and what we're doing. I think, at the end of the day, as we said, the consumer demand for our products is quite strong. So when you look at the ability to capture price and demand from the content additions and the upgrades that we've made to the new models pickup trucks, that's well within the strategy and certainly what we've seen going forward. So I think there's an industry component. As we said at the beginning of the year, we don't expect industry inventories to increase substantially this year, even in the face of our own higher production, which I think has been a little bit more robust than what we've heard from some of our competitors going forward. So we think the supply-demand construct across the industry is good. And when you look at the combination of that with our products and what we've seen from our consumers, that's what gives us some of that confidence going forward, in terms of our ability to maintain where we are. Itay Michaeli : That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on EV, and thank you for the updated disclosures on the reservations. Curious, if you can kind of share where you're seeing these reservations from a regional perspective and particularly around the coastal markets in the US, where your market share historically has been lower. So if you can maybe talk a little bit about the regional split in the EV reservations. Mary Barra : Yes. We definitely are seeing not only new customers to General Motors, but we are seeing a focus from both the East and the West Coast, where there already is a stronger demand. So what we predicted that we would see is, because we tend to underperform from a -- what I call our fair share perspective on the coast, we are seeing exactly what we said that, that was an opportunity for us to seize. We're seeing that in the reservations and also bringing new people to the company. Itay Michaeli : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next is John Murphy with Bank of America. You may go ahead. John Murphy : Good evening, everybody. And I apologize in advance, but I'm going to stick on pricing for a second. There are many layers of pricing, right? There's the actual or the transaction price the consumer pays. There's the MSRP, then there's the invoice that you get paid from the dealer. And then there's other things on dealer holdback and floor plan assistance that impacts or the net price that you realize from the vehicles from your dealers. So as you look at this, you're benefiting from strong price, but your dealers are actually benefiting even more so, with GPUs that are almost astronomical at the moment. I'm just curious if there's any change in the way that you're looking at the relationship in pricing to the dealers, maybe increasing invoice more than you're increasing MSRP or changing floor plan terms or anything like that, because there's sort of the arguably egregious grosses on the dealer side that might be earned, that might be better deserved by the folks that deploy billions of dollars of capital to generate it? Mary Barra : So, appreciate the question. And first of all, we do believe, over the long term, people will see that our dealer network is a competitive advantage. They're highly experienced. We have not only the ability to meet the customer where they want, whether they want to do something completely online, or actually go to the store, which cuts a lot of the customers. As we look at them, they still want to go in and literally kick the tires. But what we have been doing is working together to unlock efficiencies to find a better way to serve the customers and to leverage those efficiencies. So we both reduce the overall cost of sale as opposed to looking at how the pie is divided. And we've been very successful at doing that, as we roll out the new digital retail platform that we showed at Investor Day, I think that is going to be that is going to be a huge enabler to reduce the cost of the sale. And, again, we will share in a piece of that. We're confident in our plans, and we have the support of our network. We have over 95% of our Chevrolet EV dealers signing up to the platform and preparing for a phased rollout yet this year. And that's going to give customers the opportunity. They can expect to have accurate transparent pricing, and they also will be able to compare across dealers. So we think that the work that we're doing with our dealers, because we see them as a partner and making sure the customer has an overall exceptional customer ownership experience is going to be a distinguisher. John Murphy : But, Mary, I'm sorry, so as we think about the MSRP increases that may be announced, should we think about the invoice going up in a linear fashion with those MSRPs. I'm just curious, because the invoice is obviously a lot different than the MSRP. Mary Barra : Well, as we look at MSRPs, if we see -- there's a small handful of dealers that are not behaving consistent with the agreement we have with them. And we deal with them and they lose allocation. For the most part, our dealers are respecting the MSRP. I have actually had dealers send me letters committing to me that they're doing that. So we address those handful of exceptions, but for the most part, I think that's what customers will see. John Murphy : Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up. I apologize. I might have missed it. The wholesale volume assumption that goes into the FY 2022 guidance, I haven't seen it. Maybe I missed it in the press release or something. But I think you guys were talking about 25% to 30% before. Is that something that's still being reiterated, or is that -- has that changed? Mary Barra : Has not changed, yes. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Mary Barra : Hey. And before we go to the next question, let me -- I think, in answer to Itay's question, I found the information. For example, on the Silverado EV, 60% of the reservations are new to GM, 70% of the reservations are from East and West Coast. So I was -- I didn't want to quote the numbers without confirming them. But, Itay, that's the numbers behind my answer to your question. Operator, we can move on. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everyone. Hi, Mary. Mary Barra : Hi, Adam. Adam Jonas : Hi. You said there's a handful of your dealers that are charging over MSRP. Could you be specific to give us a percentage of your volume that is transacting over MSRP in real time in North America? Mary Barra : Adam, it is small. And like I said, we address it, especially those that -- it's a high, high number. So I don't have a percent off the top of my head. But again, our dealers, and we have done a lot of work with our dealers over the last couple of years, especially as they sign into our agreements and make the investments necessary to sell EVs. So I\u2019m very confident we have \u2013 we'll continue to work with our dealers to serve the customer well and provide a great customer experience. Adam Jonas : Okay, Mary. And then there are some EV peers of yours that are citing concerns that there will be \u2013 that there's an emerging battery shortage, okay, or at least bottlenecks in the supply chain that could really limit the plan \u2013 some of your remarks already, but I just want to ask it this way. Is there any part of your battery supply \u2013 Mary Barra : Hey, Adam, you're fading out. I heard you say, is there any part of your battery supply chain, and then you faded out. Adam Jonas : Sorry. Is there any part of your battery supply chain that does present \u2013 that you think presents a risk to your volume targets at this point? I understand, the situation is fluid, but I wanted to give you a chance to flag any area that's getting a little extra attention from you. Mary Barra : For the numbers that we put out, the 100,000 in 2022 and 2023 and the 1 million by 2025, barring something completely unforeseen, I think that's where we are, and we're working to find upside opportunity. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Operator : Thank you. Next, we have Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. You may go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. I was hoping you could help me better understand the outlook for this year, the way you see it now versus maybe two or three months or so ago. So, it seems on the cost side at least the commodities are maybe $2.5 billion, a larger headwind than you saw it a few months ago. What are the offsets here? I think at the time, you were thinking pricing would remain strong, but not necessarily up year-over-year. How you thinking now pricing could actually be up? And then on the cost efficiency side, can you maybe talk about some of the opportunities that you have to create some of these offsets? And then just one more on this, is it also a function of where within the guidance serve your base case. Obviously, it's a $2 billion wide EBIT guidance. So is it also the case that you may have thought you would be at the higher end and now you'd be at the lower end, or is that not the case at all? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Emmanuel, thanks for the question. So I think it's a combination of things. Yes, we've talked about the $2.5 billion of incremental pressure. We hadn't commented specifically about the assumptions in terms of pricing. But I think what you've heard from us today is that we're reasonably confident about the pricing environment and the demand that we see for GM vehicles and what we've been able to achieve. And we talked about in the in the prepared remarks about the price increases, we've seen year-over-year from that perspective. The second piece of it is, going back to what we said about the full year. We talked about a couple of billion dollars of discretionary cost increases related to putting in the foundation for future growth. There's room to prioritize within that in terms of understanding what's converting to revenue sooner rather than later and making sure that we maintain flexibility. I think if you go back to our remarks, we talked about \u2013 we were putting that cost inflation in, because we had the comfort around the environment at the time. And while we've seen cost pressures on inflation, it allows us to go in and continue to manage that going forward. So between using that discretion, and prioritizing new ads as well as looking at core cost improvement in the business as we've done, I think the track record of the company is really, really strong. You go back to the programs that we did, the $4 billion to $4.5 billion that we said was done by 2020. The work that we've done in GMI, by improving profitability, almost $2 billion over where it was in 2018, points to the team's ability to do that. So while we haven't done an aggregate number that some of our competitors have done, I think when you look at the ability of the team to execute and the results that we've posted over the last several quarters in the face of this adversity, I think the team should get some credit for that. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And then just quickly the second part about, where in the guidance you sort of feel more comfortable. And then, as a follow-up question, I was hoping to ask on the Cruise recurring liquidity program, are you able to give us some early data on how popular that has been, who has -- how much -- or how many employees have availed themselves of the opportunity? And what is the expected, I guess, liquidity cost to GM this year? Paul Jacobson : Yes. I'll take the first part, which is actually the second part of your first question. But I think, we're just -- we're comfortable with the 13% to 15%, as we've said that from the beginning. And there's a lot moving around, as we've said from the beginning of the year, and nothing has changed from that perspective. So I would say that we're in a very similar spot to where we were in an earlier quarter. The inputs and the outputs may change considerably, but I think we're pretty consistent with where we've been. Mary Barra : And on the Cruise question, it's just -- it's really too early in the first tender offer to start giving any of those numbers. So just, it's too early to share anything there. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next is Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. You may go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question, which is another one on battery metals. Relative to the upcoming long-term supply contract for nickel and the one that you recently secured for cobalt, can you confirm if these agreements are to ensure the supply of only a certain quantity of material, or whether there is also any ability to somehow ensure a certain price also or help insure, which I think is a lot harder. And then in light of the answer to that question, how do you think about the risk of taking orders for battery electric vehicles at a certain MSRP, only for battery metal prices to change significantly in the time between the order intake and production, which I'm estimating for some vehicles like the Silverado could be more than a year. When the metals prices are gyrating so much month-to-month, or even day to day, is there any way to hedge this exposure or might -- as great as it sounds, even vertical integration of the supply, the mining, I don't know, somehow even makes sense. Just curious how you're thinking about this complicated issue. Paul Jacobson : Hey, Ryan, thanks for that. I'll start, and Mary, of course, can add, too. The -- what I would say is, we've talked about the supply agreements being a mix a lot of different structures, right? We\u2019ve talked about where we're funding some capital, where we're doing preorders, take-or-pay. We're partnering with people on strategic ventures, et cetera. So there's quite a wide variety of mix of pricing mechanisms depending on how those structures work. So to the extent that we do have some pricing exposure, we, of course, have the ability to hedge some of that in the markets going forward. So we're trying not to overreact in the short run, but rather strike the right long-run balance for where we want to end up. And I think the teams executed that very, very well so far. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next is Brian Johnson with Barclays. You may go ahead. Brian Johnson : Hi, Mary and Paul. Thanks. I want to step back and ask kind of a broader strategic/organizational question given generally, which, as I talked about with people, could make a great business goal case study. Your principal cross-town competitors chosen a very different approach to EVs, both in terms of the level of preplanning in the organization that is kind of rushing to market with a minimal viable product and then backfilling and creating a separate dev organization from the ICE organization. How have you thought about it at GM where you're not pursuing a similar NewCo, OldCo type of organizational strategy? Mary Barra : So I think -- I appreciate that you recognize that we made the investments a handful of years ago that gives us the LTM platform where we really can do products like the Silverado EV that don't have any compromises with higher range, faster, fast charging, things like four-wheel steer, all because of a ground-up design. And I think everybody needs to also recognize that this platform is going to give us scalability that will lead to a cost advantage and a high degree of reuse. So I definitely think I'm very happy that we made those changes. And when you really get in and look at the organizational structure, we already have a dedicated team that works on the whole EV propulsion system. We have a dedicated Vice President where all the EV programs, all the chief engineers and all the EV programs report. We have EV Growth that looks at how we're going to go to market and has led the creation of the digital retail platform that we shared last year. We -- and part of the 2018 transformation that we did, we pulled all the software together. And since that point in time, so since 2018, early 2019, we have been -- had all that software together, and I think that's what's allowed us to accelerate. And we started rolling out the vehicle intelligence platform, which gives us pretty much over-the-air capability across the whole vehicle in 2019, and it's come out in every vehicle and now where they're taking that to the next level with Ultifi. So when you look at the structure of our company, a lot of the key work that needs to be done to enable our EV success was put in place in 2018, 2019 and 2020. And as we look across -- and I spend a lot of time talking to our employees across the whole organization, and no matter what they're working on, they're excited to be a part of our all-EV future. Let's remember, at General Motors, over 40% of our salaried employees and even higher percent of our technical talent has been with the company five years or less. And so they're here because of the mission for EVs. And we believe every single one of them is valuable and has an important role to play in our future EV, whether they're working on EVs today or they work on seats or they work on software design or interior design, all those things that exist in an EV as well. So I think the way we've really focused on what organizations need to be there. So we lead in EV execution with the scale and the high reuse that enables us to take time out of our EDP is where we're focused. Brian Johnson : And just a quick follow-on. On those EV product architecture, battery, et cetera, motor decisions, again, competitors will talk about rapid cycle decision-making, mid-model year, not just mid- platform, refreshes, changes of technology. So, how do you make sure that, that part of the organization remains agile as opposed to plans laid in 2017, 2018, 2019, that might, frankly, not be the right given current market conditions or new technologies? Mary Barra : Well, so two components of that. First, from a software perspective, we've already rolled out VIP and we're already taking it to the next level with Ultifi, which is going to really improve the speed at which we can make changes and make your product better as after you buy it, then you can download or have over-the-air updates of features that didn't even exist when you bought the vehicle. So, I think the mindset of agile quick and the vehicle just keeps getting better is well rooted in our software organization. And then when you look from an LTM perspective, remember, LTM is chemistry agnostic. We're working with many other companies and doing internal research that we will have -- to have the best battery chemistry and the LTM platform allows for that. It's upgradable. It even reads -- you can have variation within the platform. So, I think there was a lot of work that went into how Ultium was designed to give it the plug-and-play and knowing that chemistry was going to keep changing, and we needed to be agile because we can continue to work on taking cost out and improving energy density. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. You may go ahead. Philippe Houchois : Yes, good afternoon and thank you. I've got two quick questions, maybe more housekeeping. But the first one is earlier this year, like many other carmakers, you guided to financial services having lower contribution in 2022 compared to last year. If I look at your Q1, your Q1 is actually better than last year. You didn't have as much of a spike in contribution from financial services last year and some of your peers quarter-by-quarter. And I'm just wondering, do we still -- should we still think of an easing of that contribution, or is the tightness in the market creates an opportunity to maybe have similar earnings in 2022? And the other question was, I think at some point in the remarks, you made a comment about Cruise costs of about $2 billion. Do you have any revenue guidance to put against that as you launch the commercial service, or should we consider that the $2 billion of cost is basically your EBIT for the year? Thank you. Mary Barra : So, on the first question, Dan Berce is on the line. So, Dan, do you want to take that one? Dan Berce : Yes. Sure, Mary. So we earned $5 billion pretax last year. And our guide for 2022 is $3.5 billion to $4 billion. So, we do see a tail off in earnings. Now the first quarter was quite strong. But in the rest of the year two really things to consider. Number one, our residual gains will be less, primarily because of lower off-lease volume; and gains per unit will be less because we've slowed depreciation, raising book value. So, even if we get the selling prices that we're seeing in the used car market today, the book value is higher so the gains are lower. And then the other factor on residuals is as we go out to lease terminations in 2023 and 2024, we've really been quite conservative in our marks for those years. 2022 maturities, yes, we're taking full advantage of market strength. But as we go out to 2023 and 2024, we have not slowed depreciation as much. Then the other factor is on the credit side. We do expect normalization of credit as we go through 2022, both from a frequency standpoint and a recovery rate standpoint. So yeah, those two factors would be the difference between the $5 billion and our guide of $3.5 billion to $4 billion for the year. Paul Jacobson : And Philippe, it's Paul. With respect to the Cruise question, what I'll say is we haven't given any revenue guidance at all specifically as it relates to Cruise. And I'll offer Kyle the opportunity, if he wants to talk about anything in terms of the commercial migration and where we are to the extent you haven't already done it, Kyle, if you want. Kyle Vogt : Sure, Paul, real briefly. I mean, just as a reminder, we're one permit away from being able to charge for rides, which would be the beginning of our generation of significant revenue with the only 80 company in California to have applied for that permit, and the only AV company carrying members of the public in urban market, which is the only kind of place where early AV Robo Taxi fleets are going to be a viable business. But we're on track this year. We're doing really well. We've expanded our geo fence from 30% of San Francisco to over 70%, increased the size of our fleet, and have expanded the hours of operation once. And we're progressing, as Mary said, towards that full 24/7 operation. We do believe, though, this is going to be highly disruptive, both in the long term for personal car ownership, in the short term for ride-hailing type businesses, based on early customer feedback. And right now, we're maniacally focused on making sure that we delight our early customers and build the foundation for a really strong business down the road. Mary Barra : Thanks, Kyle. Philippe Houchois : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Great. Well, thanks, everybody. Paul and I and Kyle and Dan really appreciate all of your questions. As we move through this year, I want to reiterate, we're now in execution mode, because we are \u2013 we are building on the investments we made over the last several years with Ultium and with the products that we put together with the shortening of the VDP. And when we look going forward, we have incredible momentum with the three battery plants between now and 2024 and another to be announced shortly as well as the conversion of four of our plants have either happened or happening in this time frame. So we're just going to keep, keep executing and keep working toward our EV leadership goal. And I think we have a team that has demonstrated that we're going to capitalize on opportunities. We're going to solve challenges and work with our stakeholders across the company to do just that. That's our commitment to you, and that's our commitment to our investors to really create value over the long term. And so I appreciate your commitment, and thanks. I hope everybody has a great evening. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, July 26, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM\u2019s Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review GM\u2019s financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Our conference call materials were issued earlier today and are available on the GM Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today is Mary Barra, GM\u2019s Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM\u2019s Executive Vice President and CFO; Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I am happy to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. As you have seen in our press release and other materials, GM delivered $2.3 billion of EBIT-adjusted in the second quarter, which is in line with the update we shared on July 1. We also remain on track to deliver our full year guidance, which includes EBIT-adjusted of between $13 billion and $15 billion. This is a truly unique and dynamic market that presents both challenges and opportunities for GM. Overall, GM production continues to improve year-over-year despite some short-term challenges and we are on track to increase our wholesales by 25% to 30%, in line with our expectations for the year. This has helped us extend our U.S. truck leadership, where demand is the strongest and supplies are well below optimal. The Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra led the industry in total full-size pickup sales in 2020 and in 2021. We continue to lead in 2022 by a wide margin. In fact, our retail market share in the first half is up 2 percentage points to 40%. But even as we operate our truck plants at near full capacity, our inventory has remained extremely low due to continued strong demand. The stock on the ground for GM full-size pickups has been in the mid-teens in terms of days supply for more than 90 days. For full-size SUVs, it\u2019s below 10. This helps explain why we continued building trucks in June even though we couldn\u2019t ship everything right away due to supply chain issues. The facts are the customers are there for our vehicles. They have been waiting and all indications are they remain ready to buy. While demand remains strong, there are growing concerns about the economy to be sure. That\u2019s why we are already taking proactive steps to manage costs and cash flows, including reducing some discretionary spending and limiting hiring to critical needs and positions that support growth. In addition, we have modeled several downturn scenarios, and we are prepared to take more deliberate action when and if necessary. Regardless of the circumstances, we continue to move forward from a position of strength. We have a foundation of strong earnings and cash flow, an investment-grade credit rating, historically low pension obligation and outstanding vehicles, services and pricing. I like our position and I wouldn\u2019t trade it with anyone in our industry. All of this will help us continue to execute our growth strategy and insulate it from short-term market challenges. Cruise is an example. Without question, the Cruise team\u2019s launch of fully driverless commercial operations in San Francisco in June was historic. The next steps for Cruise in the second half include working with regulators to increase their hours of operation and service area, expanding their fleet of Bolt AVs and testing the Cruise Origin. And as always, we are committed to safety as Cruise expands. Kyle Vogt and I will have much more to share about Cruise on September 12 at the Goldman Sachs Technology Conference in San Francisco. We will also host our own event later that day for investors and analysts, including an opportunity to experience a fully driverless ride. Another major highlight was the first customer deliveries of the Cadillac LYRIQ earlier this month. We are extremely proud of the LYRIQ and it has received almost universal praise from the media, who says it stands with the Escalade as one of the best Cadillacs we have ever done. I can\u2019t wait until everyone sees the CELESTIQ in person. Nearly 70% of the LYRIQ reservation holders are new to Cadillac and 30% are from the West Coast. This is very similar to what we are seeing with the HUMMER EV, where 75% of reservation holders are new to GMC with a very heavy concentration in California, Texas and Florida. And looking ahead to early spring 2023, anticipation for the Chevrolet Silverado EV continues to build. We now have more than 150,000 reservations and the average fleet customer is requesting more than 200 trucks. The reaction to the Chevrolet Blazer EV has also been very enthusiastic. We think the media who says it\u2019s going to shake up the electric SUV market, thanks to its design, technology, range and pricing, are spot on. Chevrolet will follow it up in September when it reveals even more affordable Equinox EV. And the ownership experience for all of our EV customers will be enhanced by agreements like the one we just signed with the Pilot Company to expand our Ultium 360 charging network to facilitate interstate travel. Together with EVgo, GM and Pilot plan to install 2,000 DC fast charger stalls at 50-mile intervals along U.S. interstate highways with special benefits for GM owners like exclusive reservations and discounts on charging. With Pilot investing $1 billion to upgrade their customer service, we are confident that this will be a very good solution for our customers. And as our EV strategy scales, the key question investors frequently ask is, how will you build enough batteries when competition for raw materials is intensifying? And as I have said, our strategy is to control our own destiny and that includes building cells in partnership with LG Energy Solution. We are just weeks away from the launch of the 7-day operations at the first Ultium Cells JV plant in Ohio. Then each quarter, the plant will add 20% to its capacity, reaching the full 35 gigawatt per hour capacity in Q4 of 2023. Securing cells from this plant are key to significantly ramping up production of the GMC HUMMER EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ to beat pent-up demand. The second cell plant, which is under construction in Tennessee, is on track to open next year. And just last month, ironworkers and our construction partners installed the final beam in a topping-out ceremony. In Lansing, Michigan, the site of the third cell plant, the foundation work is underway and steel work will begin in August and that plant opens in 2024. And the team is also making good progress towards selecting the site for the fourth U.S. cell, which will take our projected total battery capacity to 160 gigawatts. What\u2019s happening upstream with these plants is just as critical to our long-term success. On previous calls, we had talked about all of the fully executed supply agreements GM has secured for EV raw materials and components. Today, we are announcing three more binding supply agreements. The first is with LG Chem, who will supply us with approximately 1 million tons of cathode material between now and 2030. We have also reached agreement with POSCO Chemical to supply us with CAM from their Korean operations from 2023 to 2025. The third is a multiyear supply agreement with Livent to secure significant quantities of lithium. What this means is GM now has binding agreements securing all battery raw materials supporting our goal of 1 million units in annual capacity in North America in 2025. This includes lithium, nickel, cobalt and the full CAM supply. As we move forward, we will increasingly localize our supply chain just as we have localized battery cell production. For example, due diligence is already underway to further expand capacity at the JV CAM and CAM precursor facility GM and POSCO Chemical are building in Quebec. GM and LG Chem will explore the localization of a CAM production facility in North America by the end of 2025 and Livent has a goal to transition 100% of the lithium hydroxide they are processing for GM to the U.S. I want to thank the team for their hard work to deliver this critical milestone, which includes close to 20 individual supply agreements. And I also want to thank our supplier partners. I use the word milestone deliberately, because we are planning significant volume growth to meet our Investor Day commitment of $90 billion in annual EV revenue by 2030. That means our supply chain must be even more scalable, sustainable and resilient. To that end, the team is building on existing supplier relationships and forging new ones. And for certain commodities, we will direct source up to 75% of our needs through 2030 with a focus on North America. We think this strategy will mitigate risk, drive down cost and help us deliver upside volume opportunities. As you can see from these examples, every part of the company is rising to meet today\u2019s challenges and we are adapting, changing and innovating to execute our pivot to EVs. We are being thorough, collaborative and leaving nothing to chance. And that\u2019s how we have made such huge strides and why we are so confident in our future. So thank you. And now I will turn it over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Mary and good morning everyone. I am extremely proud of the team\u2019s execution in Q2 and remain excited about our future. We are at the beginning of an accelerating EV product ramp that we believe will drive a continuous increase in revenue as we transition to an all-electric future. And as Mary highlighted, we are making significant progress on several fronts, including Cruise commercialization and our battery supply chain. Just yesterday, the Department of Energy announced a conditional commitment to Ultium Cells LLC, our 50-50 joint venture to manufacture battery cells, for a $2.5 billion loan to help fund the construction of our battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan, supporting our goal of the secure battery materials and technology supply chain here in North America. We are also finalizing the deals of GM\u2019s sustainable finance framework, which will unlock options to help us align our balance sheet with our ESG strategy. Now, let\u2019s get into the Q2 results. We generated $35.8 billion in revenue, up $1.6 billion year-over-year driven by strong pricing and slightly higher volume. We generated $2.3 billion in EBIT adjusted, 6.6% EBIT adjusted margin and $1.14 per share in EPS diluted adjusted, all within the $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion EBIT adjusted range laid out earlier this month. Our results were impacted by the short-term tactical decision to build more than 90,000 North American vehicles without certain components with revenue retime from Q2 into the second half of 2022. The supply chain challenges causing the company vehicle inventory buildup, primarily occurred in June and have continued in July, affecting some of our plans. While this is frustrating, we have built some of this uncertainty into our full year guidance. Some of these vehicles will be quick to complete. In fact, we have already wholesaled about 15,000 vehicles with the expectation to get through substantially all of the vehicles by the end of the year, with about 50% in Q3 and 50% in Q4. Despite these challenges, we have seen a continuous year-over-year volume improvement, Q1 up 1%, Q2 up 7% and we expect Q3 to be up 90% to 100% year-over-year as we lapped the significant impacts experienced in Q3 \u201821 and the retime vehicles and Q4 to be up 20% to 30%, remaining on track to increase our 2022 wholesales by 25% to 30% year-over-year as we guided to at the beginning of the year. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $1.4 billion for the quarter, down $1.1 billion year-over-year driven primarily by higher CapEx related to EV investments and the impact of holding these vehicles built without certain components in the company inventory. Let\u2019s take a closer look at North America. In Q2, North America delivered EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion, down $600 million year-over-year and EBIT-adjusted margins of 8% driven by higher commodity costs and investments in growth partially offset by strong pricing across our portfolio, but especially on our full-size trucks and SUVs and the non-recurrence of 2021 recall cost. Our mix was primarily impacted by the more than 90,000 vehicles built without certain components, about 75% of these being full-size trucks and SUVs. As Mary mentioned, new vehicles have continued to turn very quickly and U.S. dealer inventory remains tight at around 250,000 units with much of this inventory in transit. Inventory on dealer lots continues to be only 10 to 15 days. We continue to watch this very closely, but the consistently tight inventory on dealer lots over the last several quarters and months demonstrates the strong demand for our vehicles. Truck ATPs have continued to be very strong at over $60,000 and Denali continues to be a strength for GMC, accounting for nearly half of the total Yukon sales this year. Our truck and SUV customers have been asking for a broader range of choices, including premium options, which we are delivering on with the GMC Denali Ultimate, the GMC AT4X and the Cadillac Escalade V-Series. The investments we have made in these vehicles over the last couple of years, including the significant refresh to our full-size light-duty trucks earlier this year, provide a strong bridge to our all-electric future. Now, let\u2019s move on to GM International. GMI delivered second quarter EBIT-adjusted of $200 million. This included $100 million of equity loss in China, down $350 million year-over-year driven primarily by their COVID-related impacts. However, we saw an improvement starting in June with production levels beginning to recover. The China team continues to navigate a very dynamic and difficult environment, both personally and professionally. I can\u2019t thank them enough for their efforts this quarter. EBIT-adjusted in GMI excluding China equity income was $300 million, up over $500 million year-over-year with results driven by favorable pricing, volume and mix, partially offset by commodity, logistics and semiconductor impacts. These results also include a mark-to-market gain of around $150 million. The GMI results excluding China equity income and mark-to-market gain was a record Q2 and first half. The progress the team has made over the last couple of years has been impressive and I look forward to the team continuing to build upon that momentum. A few comments on GM Financial and corporate expenses. GM Financial once again delivered solid results driven by strong used vehicle prices with Q2 EBIT-adjusted of $1.1 billion, down $500 million year-over-year primarily due to the reserve adjustments made last year. Corporate expenses were $700 million in the quarter, up $700 million year-over-year driven primarily by differences in year-over-year mark-to-market changes in the portfolio. Moving to Cruise, which we are very excited about, we believe the autonomous opportunities go well beyond the robotaxi business, including delivery, personal vehicles and a commercial application with BrightDrop. Cruise expenses of $550 million for the quarter are consistent with the run-rate we would expect for the remainder of the year. Now, let\u2019s turn to our second half outlook. As we indicated earlier in the month, we are confident in achieving our full year 2022 guidance range metrics, including EBT-adjusted in the range of $13 billion to $15 billion and North America margins of 10%. We see tailwinds with volume, including completing the vehicles in company inventory. Pricing remains strong and has held up more than we estimated at the beginning of the year, helping partially offset the incremental commodity costs. We are encouraged to see some moderation in the spot prices of certain raw materials, but the timing of the flow-through of this benefit into earnings varies by commodity and typically lags. We would not expect to see a meaningful impact until later in the year and into 2023. We are also incurring significantly higher logistics costs, including premium freight to overcome some of the supply chain challenges, which is offsetting some of the moderation in raw material costs. With these puts and takes in commodity and logistics costs, we still expect about a $5 billion year-over-year headwind impacting our global operations with the expectation to offset with cost and pricing actions. GM Financial is currently trending towards the high-end of the expected $3.5 billion to $4 billion full year EBT range with some moderation anticipated in the second half as credit and used vehicle prices are expected to normalize somewhat. There are also other cost headwinds in the back half of the year, including some seasonality, growth investments and initiatives to drive EV adoption and expand charging infrastructure. However, we will be nimble in bringing on these costs at the appropriate time and remain prudent in our spending to ensure we meet our growth commitments. In summary, the first half of the year, we have seen strong pricing and continue to see a recovery in volumes. We have executed well on the things we can control and we remain focused on our growth opportunities. We are starting to see the benefits of the EV and battery investments made over the last several years. And vehicles such as the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC HUMMER EV pickup validate that we have transitioned our engineering and manufacturing expertise to EVs. We are laser-focused on execution and what you\u2019ve seen is just the start of a transformative period for GM. We are strategically building an EV portfolio in the luxury, SUV and truck segments to produce vehicles with great design at the right price points for customers and at the margins we come to expect. This concludes our opening comments. And we will now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Your line is open, sir. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mary Barra : Good morning. Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Itay. Itay Michaeli : Good morning. Just two questions for me. Just first, I was hoping you could dive a little bit deeper into the price mix assumptions you have in the second half of the year. Maybe also if you can quantify the logistics headwind, Paul, you just referenced? And second question, Mary, in the shareholder letter, I think you mentioned modeling a number of downturn scenarios and actions you can take. I was hoping we could expand a bit more about how you are thinking about various macro scenarios and options that you have and sort of maybe the range of kind of your earnings and free cash outcomes we should think about under kind of reasonable downturn scenarios? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Itay, I will start on the inflation pieces and the mix side. So, if you look at the inflation that we saw in the quarter, I would say about half of it is commodity-driven and then about the other half is split between logistics and other supply chain challenges that we have seen before. I think \u2013 the thing I am excited about in the quarter is that when you look at inflation, the pricing and the mix was able to offset largely all of that inflation as we expected it to do. I think where the second quarter challenges manifested is, obviously, we were expecting higher volumes. We have been dealing with some of these chip issues for the last couple of years. This one was a little bit late breaking, which affected the volume and the mix on the quarter. Otherwise, I think it was a really good quarter. And we feel good about making up all that volume in the back half of the year as we have outlined. So I think with the vehicles being completed out of that inventory, we should see a little bit of a richer mix in Q3 and Q4 largely because of the truck side of it, but that\u2019s going to help us keep us on track to the $13 billion to $15 billion. Mary Barra : And from a downturn perspective, we are looking at, I\u2019ll say, moderate downturn and a more severe. And we know the actions that we would take. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve already started to reduce discretionary spending, but we are doing critical skill hires because we feel we\u2019re positioned right now to continue executing our EV strategy even with some of the different things that might hit us. And it\u2019s a really unique time because there are so many factors that are very positive. As I mentioned, we\u2019re still seeing strong demand, but there are some indicators that look \u2013 that freight uncertainty for the future. So we\u2019ve done a lot in preparation. If you go back to the transformation that we did in 2018 and 2019, we completed in 2020 that took out about $4 billion to $4.5 billion of cost. We also have systematically reduced vehicles and exited unprofitable segments and regions. You\u2019ve seen about a $2 billion improvement in GMI versus 2018. And we\u2019ve done significant restructuring in India, Southeast Asia and Russia as well as retiring the Holden brand in Australia. So, the steps that we\u2019re taking right now is continue to focus on eliminating complexity reduction, not only in our ICE lineup, but also in our EV lineup to be very customer-focused. We\u2019ve done a lot as it relates to reuse, driving manufacturing efficiencies, go-to-market where we\u2019re finding efficiencies that we can actually reduce the cost of selling a vehicle and then our overall fixed cost. And so we \u2013 again, it\u2019s hard to predict exactly what the margins would be depending on what happens, where is demand. What we\u2019re seeing right now, we\u2019re still seeing strong demand for our products and frankly, as Paul said, even going in the second half of the year a higher mix. But believe me, we\u2019ve run many different scenarios, and we know the steps. We\u2019ve taken a lot of steps already, but we know the steps we would take if the situation went in a different direction. Itay Michaeli : Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thanks for all that detail. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from John Murphy of Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask first on the supply chain readiness from sort of the chip side and also from other suppliers. I mean, Mary, do you think about this \u2013 I mean, if we had like a 20% improvement in chip supply, what would that mean for volume? I would imagine just given what\u2019s going on with content and mix that it wouldn\u2019t sort of result in a 20% improvement in unit volumes. Just trying to understand that? And then also on the supply chain readiness, we\u2019re hearing lots of anecdotal stories about suppliers having a hard time getting human capital or labor and being concerned about the working capital relined as volumes ultimately recover? Mary Barra : Yes. Each supplier depending on where they\u2019re located, I think, is facing different circumstances and situation. And we have a team in our supply chain group that works with each of these suppliers. First, what we do is we go in and try to help them address their costs, figure out what we need to do to get the right resources. And so it\u2019s a very active group right now as we work across the supply chain because we know we need to have suppliers who are healthy, can get and hire the people that they need, that they\u2019re trained and that they can deliver high-quality parts to us. So I would say there\u2019s ongoing work. And there are a lot of anecdotal stories, but we just work each and every one. As it relates to the semiconductors, we do see impact from semis into next year. And \u2013 but I think depending on where we\u2019re at with demand, right now, it\u2019s hard to exactly forecast what will happen because we\u2019re selling every vehicle we can make right now. And we think there\u2019s an opportunity \u2013 we\u2019re at suboptimal levels from an inventory days on the field. We\u2019ll never go back to where we were before the pandemic. But right now, it\u2019s a little too lean. So even as we are hoping and what we see now is that we have strong demand, let\u2019s remember, we have new refresh full-size trucks. Our SUVs are, again, very strong with the enhancements that we made. And so if that \u2013 even as \u2013 or if I should say, if we get to a more normalized level that we aren\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t have pent-up demand for full-size trucks, SUVs and midsized crossovers, we still have some work to do to get a healthy level of inventory, a very lean but healthy level of inventory. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And frankly, we need more chips to do that. And as we move and continue to put more technology in vehicles, we needed even more semiconductors. That\u2019s why the strategy that we\u2019re putting in place for the 2026 time frame to have three families of semis that we leverage across our vehicles will give us much more stability, resilience and ability to transfer the semis to the segments that are most in demand. John Murphy : I guess, Mary, just to follow-up on it, more succinctly maybe to get volume up 5% to 10%, would you need like a 10% to 15% improvement in chip supply or content? I\u2019m just trying to understand. I mean, there\u2019s a very \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a question of the shortage, and then there\u2019s a question of the growing content and mix. I mean, is there sort of like a 5% to 10% delta on content and mix that we should be thinking about roughly? Mary Barra : John, it so depends on what vehicle segments. I mean, we do know trucks use more semiconductors. Full-size utilities use more semiconductors than a sedan. A lot of it depends on how much technology on the vehicle, for instance, Cruise or all of the power features. So it\u2019s really hard to make a \u2013 just a swag of what that would be. But what I will say is if you get 20% more, it\u2019s not 20% more vehicles, that\u2019s for sure. John Murphy : Okay. I\u2019m sorry, just my follow-up. When you said your severe and mild recession scenario planning, I mean, we have been in a recession level volumes for autos and certainly are this year in the U.S. and globally. When you think about mild and severe, I mean, how much value downside are you guys kind of modeling in? Because it\u2019s kind of hard to believe there\u2019s really significant unit volume downside from where you\u2019ve been traveling at least for the last 6 months for sure. Paul Jacobson : John, it\u2019s Paul. I think as we look at that, it becomes less a question about volume and more a question about pricing. So what do you have to do to stimulate the same volumes that we\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s a rather unique circumstance because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever gone into the economic noise with as low SARs as we\u2019re seeing. But a lot of that has been production. I think that\u2019s led to some of the pent-up demand that gives us confidence at least in the near-term, in the mid-term to continue to produce these vehicles and take the type of position that we took with the vehicles built without certain components. So I think it really comes down to more on the pricing on the consumer side. And all the data that we\u2019re seeing continues to give rise to strong demand for our products. John Murphy : Okay, thanks very much, guys. Mary Barra : Thanks, John. Operator : The next question comes from Rod Lache of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. So until now, just on John\u2019s question, North American sales have been constrained by supply. And they still are. And as you said, the demand still feels very strong. But if you clear out that extra 90,000 units in the back half, it looks like inventories could recover. It depends on what sales do obviously, but they could recover to the 400,000, 500,000 unit range pretty easily in North America, so maybe 50, 60 days. Just from your last comment, Paul, do you think you may need to make some adjustments to address affordability of vehicles just given the magnitude of changes that we\u2019ve seen over the past 2 years or are you kind of more inclined to throttle production in order to sort of keep the inventory in that 50 or 60-day range? Paul Jacobson : Yes, good morning, Rod. It\u2019s a fair question. I think when you look at the inventory levels, as they sit right now, the overwhelming majority of the inventory is actually in transit. It\u2019s not on the dealer lots, which I think is very different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. And as others have talked about, the logistics of getting vehicles to the dealers has been a little bit slower than normal. So I think as vehicles are getting to the dealers, they\u2019re continuing to turn very fast. We are watching that closely. That\u2019s probably one of the key data points that I spend the most time thinking about is the turn times once the vehicles come. So I think the pricing environment that we\u2019re in right now has been very good, very robust. And I think it demonstrates the demand for our products. So we\u2019ve got to continue to monitor that and continue to watch it because the cash flow that we\u2019ve got and running the business for cash flow is critical to help fund our journey in the EV transformation. Rod Lache : Okay, thanks. And just switching gears, these binding agreements on battery feedstocks, can you just give us a little bit of color on since they are binding, you\u2019ve made commitments here. Have you been able to maybe insulate yourselves a bit going forward from some of the pricing volatility on these feedstocks? And just any color on just as you struck these deals, what that tells you about prospects for EV profitability. Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Rod, I would say two things to that. Number one, we\u2019ve talked about taking a portfolio approach to these commodities, meaning that we\u2019ll take some index pricing, we\u2019ll take some fixed pricing, we\u2019ll take some discounted pricing. We\u2019re willing to invest and prepay and just be very flexible as it relates to the suppliers. And two, I would say we\u2019re focused on long-term partnerships. These aren\u2019t just contracts that we\u2019re looking to say, give me this volume of material. It\u2019s about helping our suppliers. Those producers expand their operations and doing it in a way that is focused on creating efficiencies within the entire supply chain. So these agreements today represent, I think, what is the best of the best out there in terms of creating these partnerships for the mutual interest of our suppliers and ourselves. Rod Lache : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Joe Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Joe Spak : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Paul, just on the \u2013 thanks for the color on how you expect those 90,000 plus units to come back, but I am wondering, especially given some of the comments on semiconductors, like does that \u2013 like you can make those up, but does it at all impact your ability to wholesale what you thought prior like before you had this issue because if you still have some semiconductor availability issues, like I\u2019m just wondering if that at all impacts where you think you fall in that 25% to 30% range for the year? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Joe, I would say that based on what we can see and as we\u2019ve talked about before, we get together weekly with the supply chain team to talk about this. And what we see out on the horizon gives us comfort in hitting that 25% to 30% goal. And while the year-over-year increases have been lower than that in the first half, remember how challenged we were in the third quarter of last year with Malaysia. That seemed to impact us somewhat uniquely. So that\u2019s where we get a lot of confidence. And we\u2019re already essentially 1 month through the quarter, and that\u2019s given us more confidence in terms of hitting those numbers and what the team has been able to do, both with production as well as completing those vehicles. So no concern yet. But as this quarter indicated, things sometimes happen, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do to be able to manage tactically. It was unfortunate that it happened at the end of the quarter because it crosses that quarter end. But the result is we will have that mitigated within that sort of 4 to 6-month time horizon, and we feel good about that based on our forward projections. Joe Spak : Okay. And then switching gears to the EV side, I\u2019m glad to see the Ultium cells are starting production this coming month. Can you give us an idea of how that ramps because you stuck to your 400,000 EVs over the next 2 years. It looks like maybe you\u2019ll do 50,000 or so this year. So a significant ramp next year. And I\u2019m curious like of that, let\u2019s call it, 350,000 or so, how much do you think will be supplied by that joint venture versus third parties? Mary Barra : Well, as I said in my remarks, we need the cells coming from the Ohio joint venture plant to really ramp the existing products we have, both the LYRIQ and the HUMMER. And we\u2019re weeks away from that plant starting up. It will grow. So clearly, the bulk of the volume start to add in Q4 and then much more rapid increase because of that plant through next year. So \u2013 and we\u2019ll be at full capacity. So you can almost do the math and look at it with the guidance we gave of 20% by quarter between now and then. And so the plan is very significant in helping us achieve the plan that we have to get to 400,000. Paul Jacobson : And Joe, that ramp too is, I think, pretty consistent if you just look linearly to 2025, getting to 1 million from where we are right now. So I think this shows how far ahead of this we are because cell plant 2 is coming on in \u201823, cell plant 3 in \u201824 and so on. So we really see this as a very thoughtful, methodical approach of ramping up that volume. But I think you pointed out why we\u2019re so excited about the trajectory of where we sit right now. Joe Spak : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. I wanted to follow-up on Rod\u2019s question about the inflationary cost environment on metals and your long-term profitability assumptions of your EV business. Given how much the market has changed upstream and battery materials specifically, notwithstanding your efforts to mitigate and control your destiny, how has that changed your long-term view of profitability or returns on the EV business? Mary Barra : So Adam, overall, we\u2019re still targeting the 10% margins as we go through this decade. Of course, when you see some of the increases right now, they\u2019re going to have an impact broadly not only the EV materials but across all commodities. But no one knows exactly where they\u2019ll be in 2, 4, 6 years as we go through this. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re continuing to drive efficiencies. That\u2019s what engineers do. We solve problems. We take cost out. We find technology solutions. We\u2019re working with not only internally but with LG, but with several other EV people involved in the battery chemistry and different parts of it to take cost out. That\u2019s why we have the Wallace R&D center for manufacturing starting up this fall. As we look at a lot of promising battery technologies, where people struggle is to scale at automotive grade and have the manufacturing consistency. We know how to do that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll have R&D operations working with many of these companies to do that. So I\u2019m confident as we continue to progress, we\u2019re going to find ways to take cost out and drive efficiencies that we\u2019re going to achieve the goals that we had from a margin perspective. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Can I just follow-up on GM Financial? Obviously, gives you really unique insight into the health of the consumer. And given the deteriorating environment facing the consumer, you see Walmart\u2019s warning overnight, what changes are you making in either the originations or provisioning or other aspects of GM Financial to help protect the business in a deteriorating environment? Dan Berce : Yes. Adam, this is Dan Berce. I\u2019ll take that. So really, on a regular basis, we take a granular approach to analyzing our portfolio by product, term, credit tier, structure, structure meaning payment to income LTV and many other views. And based on these views, we make decisions constantly whether to tighten or ease credit. What we\u2019re seeing now in our GM new car portfolio, we\u2019re seeing extremely strong performance regardless of credit tier. On the used side, there\u2019s probably places that \u2013 segments that we\u2019re a bit more concerned about and that we would look to tighten. But the new car portfolio is the vast majority of our portfolio, and it\u2019s performing very, very well. So really no view to tighten there at this point. As far as reserve levels, we\u2019ve been expecting credit normalization all along. And so normalization is built into our reserves and provisioning already. In this quarter, in particular, we \u2013 our economic overlay that we have to apply under the CECL methodology, we\u2019ve taken a view to a weaker economic environment going forward. So that economic overlay would serve to increase our reserves that we took this quarter. Adam Jonas : Thanks so much. Mary Barra : Thanks, Adam. Operator : The next question will come from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I see you\u2019re continuing to guide to a full year EBIT of $13 billion to $15 billion, which is far above consensus for less than $12 billion. If I had to guess, probably the difference relates to skepticism regarding sustainability of record pricing as the economy softens and maybe likely the sequential deliveries ramp from the first half to the second, given continued issues with chip availability. Are you able to update on what the very latest might be in terms of pricing? Maybe what gives you the confidence that pricing will hold in as inventory normalizes? Are there any examples in your portfolio you could point to or maybe inventory for select vehicles has improved yet the pricing did hold in? And with regard to the chip availability to support the 25% to 30% growth in wholesale for the full year, what visibility do you have to being able to secure those chips? Could maybe a cooling of economic conditions ironically help chip availability by reducing demand elsewhere in the industry or even maybe outside the auto industry? How are you thinking about pricing and chips tracking in the back half of the year in order to make that above-consensus guidance? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. So I would say that at the end of the day, all the data that we\u2019ve seen to date on vehicle pricing and demand remains strong. I think I alluded to turn times earlier, what we see with Dan\u2019s data from GM Financial but also importantly, the fact that while we\u2019ve increased production to date, inventories on the ground at dealers hasn\u2019t changed in really about six quarters even as production has gone up. So we still think that there is a big pocket of demand that hasn\u2019t been met yet. And we continue to meet that. We\u2019ll respond, but we \u2013 if we need to, but we feel good about where that sits, which is why we had the confidence to build those vehicles without fully completing them and be able to work through those. As it relates to the chips, again, we had a level of confidence about the chip supply as we gave our guidance for 2022. It didn\u2019t mean that it was over. In fact, we highlighted that we\u2019d still see some challenges, and we have seen challenges but largely been in line with our expectations for the year. So there hasn\u2019t been anything in the first 6 months or even the last couple of months that has deteriorated our confidence in being able to hit that full year goal. And in some cases, pricing has been more resilient for longer than we expected going into the year. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s giving us the confidence around that $13 billion to $15 billion guide, and we continue to remain focused on it. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the trajectory for Cruise EBIT, the losses seem to pick up there a little bit as you commence more commercial operations, maybe you have more people on the ground. What\u2019s the way to think about that, that the losses do pick up as you launch operations? Or maybe as you launch operations, begin to generate some revenue, you can amortize some of the more fixed costs? How should we think about EBIT there tracking over the next year or so? Mary Barra : I\u2019ll let Kyle comment, but I would say, first off, we are very confident and excited about Cruise\u2019s opportunities to scale. With what they are demonstrating in 30% of the San Francisco area having the ability to charge for rides and with the plans that we have for this year and next, we are going to make sure that we have all of the resources available to scale that business quickly because we do think there is a first-mover advantage. And so one of the strengths and the work that Cruise and GM do together is make sure that we have a plan and we have the funding available to support a rapid growth strategy. I don\u2019t know, Paul, if you have any specifics on the amortization of the investment. Paul Jacobson : Yes. So, I think at the end of the day, it\u2019s continuing to perform at or faster than we expected going forward. The increase in cost is both headcount, but it\u2019s also a change in the compensation expense, given what we have seen with the liquidity option that we have provided. That\u2019s all built into our cash expectation for the year. So, there haven\u2019t really been any surprises for Cruise going forward. Mary Barra : And I don\u2019t know, Kyle, if you have anything that you want to add just overall related to Cruise. Kyle Vogt : Yes sure. Thanks, Mary. When you have got the opportunity to go after a $1 trillion market where you can have a highly differentiated technology and product, you don\u2019t casually weigh into that. You attack it aggressively. And given our strong cash position in Cruise, we are able to do this and aggressively presenting the market, I think, is a competitive advantage. And given our position right now, I think the results speak for themselves. But what you are seeing right now is the early commercialization. We just have that first initial revenue coming in. Our first driverless ride was just November last year. And since then, we are doing over 0.25 million \u2013 we have done over 0.25 million driverless rides, thousands of customer adds and covering 70% of one of the top ride-share markets in the world. So, we are scaling that up very rapidly. It\u2019s exponential. I think it\u2019s going to catch people by surprise. But certainly, on our initial scale, we \u2013 there is quite a bit of cash spending, but that\u2019s in preparation for the ramp that we expected to do over the next year or so. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Hi guys. Good morning and thank you very much for taking the questions. First one is on China. Maybe you can talk both in terms of your ability to operate as the Shanghai region has reopened, and there are still constraints on your ability to operate in China, but also what you are seeing in terms of demand in the China region. I think there has been some stimulus that perhaps helped the demand to recover. Do you think that\u2019s sustainable in the China region? Mary Barra : So, clearly, during the shutdown phase and specifically with a lot of our operations in Shanghai, we saw a drop in the Q2 timeframe. When some of those restrictions started to open, we already saw improvements in the June timeframe. And we are very optimistic that we can regain share and also be a very significant player from an EV perspective. We have the LYRIQ launch that\u2019s coming very shortly. And we have our plans there to convert more than 50% of our foot \u2013 manufacturing footprint in China to EV production by 2030. We also have the strong performance and the leaders \u2013 sales leadership that we have with SGMW with the Hong Guang Mini. So, we are expecting a recovery. It might be slowed as China ramps. We are encouraged by some of the stimulus that the government has put in. But we do feel with our lineup coming in China, we will have a strong recovery. Mark Delaney : That\u2019s helpful. My second question was a follow-up on the battery raw materials agreement. And now that you have some added visibility on the raw materials front into your battery cost structure, can you talk about whether or not you still think GM is tracking at the battery pack level for cost to be under $100 per kilowatt hour mid-decade? Thank you. Mary Barra : So, that\u2019s what we are continuing to work to make sure that we hit those and go well below $100 because we need to do that from an affordability perspective. And again, as I mentioned before, it will be by manufacturing efficiencies, by scaling the operations, we have an advantage with the LTM platform because we can scale. We don\u2019t have a lot of unique configuration that\u2019s going to help us take cost out as well overall. So, we are looking at the total cost of the vehicle. I mean in some of the cases, the raw material prices will be what they are, but we think we will have a differential advantage to our competitors because of the strategy that we are executing. Operator : We will move on to the next question, Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. One of the hardest things for us and I think investors to assess is what is the pricing downside risk, vehicle pricing risk as we move into potential downturn or recession. So, I was very encouraged to see you have been sort of like refreshing some of these downturn scenarios. And I was wondering if you would be willing to share some of your framework there. I think a few years ago, you used to host these GM office hours, where I think you had a historical framework around potential pricing pressure. Just curious if you could help us with how do you think about it? Paul Jacobson : Good morning Emmanuel, I think two things to that. Number one, we are going through our long-term planning process with the Board. And we will have more to share in the fall just generally about the multiyear forecast and kind of how we are trending towards Investor Day goals, etcetera. Second, I think that there is a level of sort of normalization, and there is a level of recession across the board. So, as Mary articulated, looking at moderate and severe is kind of what dictates that. So, I think when we look at pricing, certainly in a down demand world, we would expect to see potentially some significant moves in pricing. But I think as we model out the recession, then we have got to figure out what happens to commodities, what happens to logistics, etcetera, where we would expect a lot of the air to come out of that balloon. So, I think we have got a decent sort of natural hedge to some of that in the event of a downturn. But no comments on any specific pricing variables that we are putting into it. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then I guess one of the potentially growing \u2013 as I am thinking about the goods [ph] for the next sort of like 18 months or so, I think the one that could become more important is the near-term profitability of some of the electric vehicles. Obviously, with the goal to produce 400,000 units between this year and next, this is going to be a meaningful volume contributor next year. So, I know forecasting mid and long-term is probably going to be pretty difficult, but as we think about it maybe going to next year with this volume ramping up, how should we think about it as a factor? What sort of contribution margin are you expecting in the near-term? Paul Jacobson : So, as we have talked about before, Emmanuel, I think our goal here is to get EVs to ICE parity by mid to late part of the decade going forward. So, I think we haven\u2019t talked specifically about vehicle profitability and we don\u2019t. But I think, generally, with EVs, I think you are going to see some rapid improvement in profitability on every model as we scale it up. And as we get the Ultium battery plants flowing and increase capacity, that\u2019s a key driver of our strategy going forward. So, in the short run, there is some pressure, but I am not sure that it\u2019s all that meaningful against where we are. As we get to getting to the 1 million vehicles and beyond, we should expect some pretty steady year-over-year improvements as we ramp up EV production. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. Great. Thank you. Mary Barra : Thanks Emmanuel. Operator : The next question comes from Chris McNally of Evercore. Your line is open. Chris McNally : Good morning team. Just a follow-up to Ryan\u2019s question on Cruise, I guess is it fair to say you just maybe don\u2019t want to comment on the shape of the EBIT burn rate specifically for \u201823 right now or you are holding off until the September event? The reason I ask is I think investors are just going to assume in the absence that the losses may accelerate materially next year as San Francisco ramps, more cars, more rides, but also new cities are launched. So, even if not quantified, are we thinking about the shape of that EBIT burn going up next year correctly? Mary Barra : First, I think Chris, Kyle and I are going to be speaking in September at the conference, the Goldman Sachs conference there. And then we will be providing more input from a forecast for 2023 when we give guidance. So, I would say we are going to make sure we fund Cruise and the spending is done in such a way that we can gain share and have a leadership position as well as we have plans that we are taking cost out as well as we \u2013 as the technology matures. Obviously, the Origin will be an important part of that as well. So, what I would ask is you stay tuned until we talk in September, and then we will give further guidance as we give overall guidance for 2023. Chris McNally : Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful, Mary. And then just maybe you could remind us, Kyle, just the comments that you guys have made publicly about what cities may be next. I know Arizona, there is a lot of testing. Is Dubai referenced in the media? And then anything around the timing of \u2013 or what a 100% launch may look like in early 2023? Will there be a ride-hailing app into the public in 2023, again, anything that you can comment on? Kyle Vogt : Yes. So, we haven\u2019t announced our next cities yet for obvious reasons, but mainly that we don\u2019t want to give everyone a heads up where we are going and when. But that we have very aggressive scaling plans for future years. We have done substantial work to de-risk the technical approach to taking what works well in San Francisco and deployed in other similar and attractive ride-share markets. And then on the ride-share app, we do have an app now that is open to the public. Thousands of members of the public have used it in San Francisco, and we are able to charge fares for the majority of those rides. So, that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s early stages. That\u2019s pretty fresh off the press just in the last couple of months. But that was a big step for us going from essentially a pre-revenue company to the beginning of our first revenue coming in and at the beginning of that rapid scaling trajectory. Chris McNally : Okay. Thanks so much. Look forward to September. Mary Barra : Thanks Chris. Operator : The next question will come from James Picariello of BNP Paribas Exane. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hey. Good morning guys. Just on commodities and freight. So, I mean at current spot rates today and the timing of your contracts, is there any way to be thinking about based on the lag in your P&L flow-through what next year could look like, again, using the hypothetical exercise of current spot rates as the baseline? Paul Jacobson : Yes. I would say, James, it\u2019s premature to be giving any 2023 guidance from that standpoint. Certainly, it would be better as evidenced by the fact that you look in 2021, we had a lag benefit as commodity prices were going up. So, we have about a third of our commodities that are kind of on index pricing and about two-thirds that are on sort of multiyear agreements going forward. So, I would say stay tuned for that. The commodities environment is obviously going to change quite a bit from here to there. But there are some savings there certainly as it sits right now. James Picariello : Savings for next year. Okay. Paul Jacobson : Yes. James Picariello : And then any color on the timing of the announced fourth battery plant? I thought the company was hoping to make an announcement sometime in the first half. So, just curious what\u2019s there? And then can you provide any details on the timing and the terms of the $2.5 billion U.S. government loan announced today through the ATVM program? Thanks. Mary Barra : So, the announcement for the fourth battery plant will be in the not-too-distant future. It will definitely be this year. So, just stay tuned on that. Obviously, there is a lot \u2013 the team has done a tremendous amount of work. So, we are approaching announcement there. And then I will let you talk about the terms. Paul Jacobson : Yes. So, on the Department of Energy loan, we obviously still need to close that loan. As we close it, we will have more details on it. But it is a loan to Ultium Cells LLC, so it benefits both us and LG Energy Solutions, and it is non-recourse to GM. Beyond that, we will disclose more at closing. James Picariello : Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Colin Langan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. If battery raw material costs don\u2019t fall, what are the cost opportunities to offset this pretty big increase? I mean I am estimating right now that EVs are probably possibly $7,000 more costly than internal combustion engine, which is a pretty large gap. So, how can you fill that gap going forward, particularly as we go into next year with the big ramp? I mean it seems like your margin targets haven\u2019t changed really, and the spike seems to be a pretty material headwind. Mary Barra : Well, I think as we ramp up, scale is going to be a very important piece of it. I would also say the team continues to find opportunities to take cost out of battery cell manufacturing, finding manufacturing efficiencies. We have found opportunities in purchasing. We can \u2013 and over the, I will say, the mid to a little bit longer term, we will continue to look at what chemistries we can use that improve cost, also chemistries that use less of the more expensive materials. So, Colin, really, we look at every single element to take cost out. Our number one goal right now is to get these battery plants up and get it launched because there is such strong demand for the products that we have, whether it\u2019s the HUMMER or the LYRIQ and continuing \u2013 we are seeing really good interest in the Bolt from a customer perspective. But as we get into next year with the Silverado EV, the Blazer EV, the Equinox EV and yet this year later, the SUV of the HUMMER, we are busy getting everything ramped up. And then if one thing General Motors\u2019 engineering team and manufacturing team knows how to do is take cost out, and we will do it. Colin Langan : Okay. You talked about pricing is stable. Can you comment a bit on lead times or in this unusual environment where you kind of have a lot of preorders. Some of the dealers have indicated that the lead times have shrunk. Is that true? Is that what you are seeing that the lead times have kind of started to normalize? Mary Barra : No. I mean there could be for specific products, we might be seeing that. But frankly, for our most in-demand products, when you look at full-size trucks and SUVs, there is \u2013 we still really aren\u2019t seeing a change in the lead time to get these products out. Colin Langan : Okay. Alright. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our last question comes from Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. Your line is open. Jairam Nathan : Yes. Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So, I just had a question on inventory. You talked about pretty like 90% to 100% increase in the third quarter and 20% to 30% in the fourth. How should we look at the mix of production? We have seen companies like Walmart kind of building inventory of the wrong things. And especially given gas prices and large SUVs, it seems counterintuitive. So, how should we look at the mix in terms of how much the production volume? Mary Barra : Well, right now, we can\u2019t build enough full-size trucks and SUV as we mentioned, mid-teens and even lower from a \u2013 for full-size SUVs. So, it\u2019s something we watch very, very carefully. And I think the opportunity we have, we still expect very strong demand. A lot of these vehicles, we have customers waiting for them. Believe me, I get emails from them waiting for their trucks and SUVs. And so we are confident with the decision we made in June to build these vehicles that we are going to see strong demand. And then post that, when we do eventually, and we don\u2019t know when start to see demand start to normalize, we still have work to do to build the inventory to the appropriate level. Again, never back to where even close to where we were, but at a level. So, with that, we are confident in the vehicles we are building today that we have strong demand for them. Jairam Nathan : Okay. As a follow-up, I just wanted to understand, like how do \u2013 what\u2019s the plan to allocate these battery packs? And it looks like for some of your products like BrightDrop, for instance, it looks like there is a lot of demand. And you are \u2013 you have announced quite a bit of EVs coming up. So, how do you kind of allocate the battery resources between these vehicles? Mary Barra : Yes. So, we look across all the whole EV portfolio that we have off of Ultium and look where the strongest demand is. And in general, we are going to allocate where we see the strongest demand. The challenge we have right now is our \u2013 that\u2019s why we are so excited to get battery plant cell one up and next year plant two and the following year plant three because right now, our demand is outstripping our capacity. And so we look to kind of make sure we are covering all the key segments and the customers. And a lot of it is just looking at what that demand is and kind of allocating across. So, we will continue to do that, especially where we see the strongest demand for whether it\u2019s the fleet vehicles from BrightDrop, knowing the importance of getting affordable EVs out with the Blazer and Equinox, but also the strength that we are going to see \u2013 that we are already seeing in the Silverado EV and the LYRIQ as well. So, it\u2019s a problem we are working out of, but frankly, it\u2019s a better problem to have than others. Jairam Nathan : Okay. Just to understand if I kind of put a spectrum, right, like, let\u2019s say, Bolt\u2019s at the one end, and BrightDrop\u2019s the other. One would argue that you should be making all BrightDrops or the Silverados, but would that be the plan, or would it be more spread out? Mary Barra : It will be more spread out as we look to have the portfolio because remember, having vehicles in the key segments that there is huge demand for, I think is going to drive EV volume. So, again, we will allocate as we evaluate the market and the ability because we have common cells and the packs that gives us a lot of flexibility to make decisions as we see how the demand unfolds. Jairam Nathan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Thank you so much. As Paul and I have discussed today, we believe the team is executing well on both our short-term and our long-term commitments even in this environment that\u2019s pretty uncertain. We have a strong foundation in place. And we believe, as I just said, we are rolling out the right EVs in the right segments. We have strength across Cadillac, strength across Chevy, and you will see it in GMC and HUMMER as well. And we also \u2013 the feedback that we are getting with the performance, the design, the technology on these vehicles, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the response that we are seeing from every vehicle that we reveal. So, we feel that there is going to be strong customer demand, and that will, again, as we execute our business plan, get us to the margin targets that we have talked about. I will also say, we are very pleased that we will host another investor event in the fall in New York City and one that includes hands-on experience with their EVs. So, you can see these vehicles and the strengths that they bring to the market. We are going to have more details to share soon, but please mark your calendars for November 17th. And I look forward to seeing you there if I don\u2019t before then. So, thanks again for all your questions, and I hope everybody has a good day. Operator : That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We\u2019re asking analysts to limit their questions to one and a brief follow-up. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, October 25, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thank you, Madison, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us to review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I would like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining the call. During the third quarter, the GM team, once again, demonstrated our ability to deliver strong results while executing our growth strategy and managing multiple headwinds. The third quarter brings our EBIT-adjusted earnings for the first nine months of the year to $10.7 billion, which keeps us on track to deliver our full year guidance. We translated improved supply chain performance into another quarter of full-size pickup and full-size SUV sales leadership with very strong mix and pricing. The Cadillac Escalade also continues to lead its segment by a wide margin. Chevrolet and GMC unveiled new mid-size and heavy-duty pickups to help maintain our strong position when they launch. And the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV are selling at record levels, thanks to their range, technology and value. And in September, they outsold the Ford Mustang Mach-E more than 2 :1. BrightDrop is generating revenue in the last-mile delivery segment. And later this year, CAMI Assembly is set to launch BrightDrop production, making it Canada's first large-scale EV plant. Production will ramp up in 2023 to begin fulfilling major orders from our customers, including Walmart, FedEx and Merchants Fleet. In addition, BrightDrop launched Trace Grocery eCart last month to help speed up online grocery order fulfillment, with Kroger slated to be the first customer. And as Kyle shared last month, Cruise has begun its expansion into Austin and Phoenix and he'll share an update in a few minutes. So it has been a great team effort by everyone, and I really want to thank and recognize the GM team, our suppliers and our dealers. While the operating environment remains challenging, our team continues to adjust quickly when and where it needs to. This is especially true of our supply chain and manufacturing teams. During the quarter, we completed and shipped nearly 75% of the unfinished vehicles we held in the company inventory in June. That's well ahead of the plan we shared at our last earnings call. As we've moved through the year, we have seen gradual improvement in the supply chain, including semiconductors. Short-term disruptions will continue to happen, but we're taking concrete steps to minimize them and build long-term resiliency. This includes signing several strategic supply agreements for mature nodes where supply is most constrained. We are also working directly with semiconductor suppliers, ensuring long-term forecast to increase transparency and ensure their planning cycles include our volume. I'd also like to recognize the GM China team. Despite disruptions caused by COVID lockdowns, morale is strong, and the business has returned to profitability, and they are building momentum in China's fast-growing EV market. This includes strong sales of the Wuling Hong Guang MINI EV, which remains China's best-selling electric vehicle; the September launch of the Cadillac LYRIQ and the debut later this year of the first Buick EUV on the Ultium platform. As we grow EV volumes, we continue to benefit from investments we have made in new ICE products and manufacturing capacity, especially in our truck portfolio, where we are the industry leader. In fact, we took full-size pickup leadership from the Ford F-Series in 2020 and have held it ever since. We'll press our advantage with the new 2024 Chevrolet Silverado HD and GMC Sierra HD, which will be available in the first half of 2023. The far-ranging improvements to these trucks, including redesigned interiors, enhanced trailering technology and new high-feature models like the ZR2 for Chevrolet and the Denali Ultimate for GMC, are designed to support continued strong pricing. We are also launching all-new Chevrolet Colorados and GMC Canyons in the first half of 2023, which will include new premium off-road offerings. Importantly, the launches will be accompanied by significant reductions in complexity. For example, we reduced the number of cab and bed configurations from 3 to 1 to focus on the fastest turning model, and we've also reduced our engine options from 3 to 1. Going forward, all Colorados and Canyons will be powered by the Silverado and Sierra's high output 2.7-liter turbo engine, which is a great solution for customers and our business. The new engine offers more horsepower and torque than the outgoing gas powertrains, and we expect a one - to two-mile per gallon fuel economy improvement on most models. Let's turn next to our EV supply chain and manufacturing base, where we are vertically integrating and scaling. To meet strong demand, we will soon be transitioning production of the Cadillac LYRIQ and GMC HUMMER EV from using imported cells to cells produced at our Ultium Cells joint venture plant in Ohio. At the same time, work is underway for higher production at Factory ZERO as well as volume production at CAMI Assembly in Ramos Arizpe starting in 2023 and Orion Assembly in 2024. Construction is also underway on two more Ultium cell plants that will open in 2023 and 2024, respectively. This will help us meet strong and growing demand for the GMC HUMMER EV, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Chevrolet Equinox EV and Blazer EV, along with the GMC Sierra EV and BrightDrop vans. All of our 2023 launches are progressing well. However, due to a slightly slower launch of cell and pack production than we expected, our plan is now to produce 400,000 EVs in North America over the course of 2022, 2023 and the first half of 2024. We are always gated by quality, and everything we've learned will help us scale more than -- to more than 1 million units of annual capacity in 2025 with even greater confidence. For growth beyond 2025, we continue to secure our future with strategic supply agreements and direct investments in natural resource recovery, processing and recycling. The most recent example is the strategic investment we made in Queensland Pacific Metals of Australia to secure cost-competitive nickel and cobalt. The new clean energy tax credits of the US certainly validate our strategy, and they will be a strong tailwind to expand domestic supply chain capacity and drive EV adoption. As we scale the Ultium platform, we have been very intentional to position the company for volume growth, but with flexibility, efficiency and increased EV profitability over time. This includes fully leveraging the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV. We're planning to increase Bolt production from about 44,000 vehicles in 2022 to 70,000 vehicles next year, because demand is at record levels. We will use our industry-leading loyalty to move Bolt customers into one of our new EVs, like the Chevrolet Equinox EV for their next purchase. Our Bolt EV and EUV owner base should surpass 200, 000 at the end of next year. If we retain them at our average customer loyalty rate of 64%, that's more than 100,000 future customers for Ultium platform vehicles. I believe we can do even better, because our new EVs are that good. As I've said, customer demand is strong and growing for the LYRIQ, the HUMMER EV, the Silverado EV, the Blazer EV and the early customer and media response to the Equinox EV and the GMC Sierra EV we just unveiled have been overwhelmingly positive. Electric.com wrote that affordability makes the Equinox EV a win for the company and EV buyers everywhere. And MotorTrend said, it could be one of the first vehicles to trigger a title wave of EV demand. And with the Sierra EV, GMC will be the only brand with three all-electric trucks in the market, and they are all incredibly distinctive, thanks to the flexibility of the Ultium platform. The Sierra EV Denali's Edition 1, 400 miles of range; 350-kilowatt DC fast charging; 9,500 pounds of towing, bold styling and luxurious refinements make it unlike anything else in the market. In addition, the agreement we struck with Hertz to deliver as many as 175,000 EVs over the next five years will build on this momentum. Huge segments of the US population have never driven an EV, and renting one for personal or business travel will be far more immersive than a test drive at a dealer. These customers as well as experienced EV drivers will see just how exciting and well executed our products are, and this can help increase purchase consideration and sales for GM EVs. There have been many other exciting developments this summer and fall, and I'd like to briefly mention two that speak directly to the power of our brands and the new business opportunities ahead of us. The first is the Cadillac CELESTIQ that we revealed just days ago. It is a completely bespoke work of automotive art, built around the most advanced and innovative technology we have ever engineered. Media described the CELESTIQ as the most advanced, most luxurious and one of the most important vehicles Cadillac has ever made. But one headline really captured its essence. Cadillac outrolls Rolls Royce. The second is the growth of Super Cruise. Our customers have now traveled 40 million miles with Super Cruise engaged, and the numbers are growing very quickly. We recently doubled its road network to more than 400,000 miles of interstates and non-divided highways, making it even more valuable to customers who already have highly -- are as highly satisfied with the technology. By the end of next year, it will be available on 22 models globally. While we are expanding the competitive advantage we have in advanced driver assistance systems with Super Cruise, the Cruise team in San Francisco continues to make rapid progress in autonomous vehicles. Kyle is with us, so I'd like to invite him to share an update with you. Kyle Vogt : Thanks, Mary. Overall, we remain largely on track for our goals this year, including expansion in San Francisco and the goal we announced in September, to begin commercial driverless operation in two new markets. We've now driven well over 400,000 fully driverless miles in San Francisco and given thousands of rides to members of the public, and we expect to expand our service area and hours of operation soon. We believe this is now the largest, fastest-growing and most successful commercial robotaxi service in existence and by a large margin. We've done this while building up a solid track record around safety, especially our safety culture, which drives our decision-making and approach to responsible EV deployment. Our product experience is getting better all the time, and we see this reflected in increased adoption and in many rave reviews we receive across both our ride-hail and delivery operations. As you may recall, we plan to do early commercialization in 2021 and 2022, and we have. Next year marks the beginning of our rapid scaling phase where we plan to churn through the backlog of users waiting to use our service, ramp up our operations and start to generate meaningful revenue. As for our new markets, Austin and Phoenix, we remain on track to complete our first commercial driverless public rides and deliveries by the end of the year. This will begin at limited scale initially and ramp up as we produce more vehicles. Our current status is that our mapping systems worked as expected, and we've started supervised testing in Austin with more than a dozen vehicles. As we had hoped, we're finding that most of our AV systems generalize well to new markets and for the handful of things that are unique to Austin, I've seen donkeys, petty cabs, police on horses, our continuous learning machine is able to automatically mine for these unusual things and then retrain our neural networks to better handle those situations. The same technology is already in use in San Francisco and will be used in all other markets, so that our AV system will continuously adapt to changes that occur within that market, such as new kinds of scooters or predominance of HUMMER EVs or however else cities might change. As for the industry, we're seeing increased separation between the company's operating commercial driverless services and those that are still stuck in the trough of disillusionment. What's happening here is that the companies with the best product have pulled ahead and are accelerating. The best talent follows the best products, and those people are what makes a company great. They have a highly vested interest in identifying and moving to the clear winners, and they're good at it. This virtuous cycle fuels the growth of the leaders and stunts the progress of the laggards. And it happens not just with talent, but also with suppliers, partnerships and investors. And you've seen this play out at Cruise with us pulling in timing and expanding scale, which is an anomaly in an industry that is dominated by delayed milestones and missed targets. Thank you. Back to you, Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Kyle. I appreciate the update and all the work the team is doing at Cruise. So before I turn the call over to Paul, I want to encourage all of you to join our Investor Day on November 17. We plan to use this time to go deeper into the second phase of our EV growth strategy. Phase 1 was focused on technology innovation, specifically the development of our proprietary Ultium and Ultifi platforms. Phase 2 is the rapid scaling of our product portfolio based on Ultium and Ultifi while leveraging ICE vehicles to maintain strong margins. And in Phase 3, we'll drive rapid revenue and margin growth across the entire ecosystem through software-defined vehicles, crews and other initiatives to create a flat-wheel effect. Phase 2 has already begun and Mark Reuss, Doug Parks, Travis Katz, Paul and I will show you how it accelerates through 2025. We will include KPIs to help you track our EV progress, including margin improvement. Then in the first half of 2023, we are playing a deep dive into our software-defined vehicle strategy to show you how we will leverage Ultifi to help expand revenue and margin. We also plan to share new details about the expansion of Super Cruise, the launch of Ultra Cruise and other high-return technology initiatives. Both events are going to be exciting and compelling. With that said, I'll turn the call over to Paul. Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us. We've stressed that this year is about executing. In the beginning of the year, we highlighted $5 billion of inflation impact [ph] the business, but set out to perform at or near the record levels that we achieved in 2021. Now that we are more than three-quarters of the way through the year, I'm extremely proud of the progress that our global team has made. We remain well on our way to achieving the commitments we outlined in February. Volumes were up 80% year-over-year as we successfully completed and shipped nearly 75% of the vehicles built without certain components held in company inventory at the end of Q2. This tailwind was partially offset by logistical challenges we have seen, particularly from Mexico, which has impacted our ability to recognize revenue on certain in-transit vehicles, along with some spot plant downtime. Overall, parts availability and supply chain issues continue to slowly trend in the right direction, with the team working tirelessly to navigate the dynamic environment. As a result, we remain on track to increase full year 2022 wholesales by 25% to 30% year-over-year and delivered North American EBIT margins of 10%. Q3 revenue of $41.9 billion was a record for the company. We achieved $4.3 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 10.2% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.25 in EPS diluted adjusted. We generated $4.6 billion [indiscernible] cash flow during the quarter and continue to expect $7 billion to $9 billion cash flow for the full year. Our strong cash generation allows us to continue investing in our future, while at the same time, returning cash to shareholders. The confidence in our longer-term outlook informed the Board's decision in August to reinstate a corporate dividend and increase our share repurchase authorization to $5 billion. During the quarter, we bought back $1.5 billion of stock, retiring 38 million shares. North America delivered Q3 EBIT adjusted of $3.9 billion, up $1.8 billion year-over-year, and EBIT-adjusted margins of 11.2%, primarily driven by higher volume and pricing, partially offset by higher commodity costs, as well as investments in growth. Q3 EBIT was positively impacted by the completion of a substantial amount of the vehicles that we built without certain components, which we said last quarter were primarily full-size trucks and SUVs. As production improves, we're closely monitoring dealer stock and inventory turns to appropriately match supply with demand. The number of vehicles physically on dealer lots is well below historical levels and continues to be tight at around 20 days. Importantly, demand remained strong for our highest margin projects with very fast turn rates. These included HD pickups, like the Sierra, which is turning in about 10 days, and our full-size SUVs are turning even faster. Total dealer stock, including in-transit vehicles, increased due to a combination of higher production, clearing out the portion of company inventory and logistical challenges that have lengthened the [indiscernible] vehicles to arrive at dealers. Pricing in Q3 was favorable versus Q2 and well above Q3 last year. Costs were up year-over-year, primarily due to increased commodity and logistics expenses; engineering, software development costs; and the absence of a favorable Bolt recovery in the third quarter last year. GM International delivered third quarter EBIT adjusted of $300 million, up $100 million year-over-year, as the team continued to navigate a volatile and dynamic environment. This included $300 million of equity income in China, up slightly year-over-year, as production levels have continued to improve from COVID-related impacts earlier in the year. EBIT-adjusted in GMI, excluding China equity income was breakeven, also up slightly year-over-year with results driven by favorable pricing and volume, partially offset by the same mix and commodity costs. Year-to-date EBIT adjusted is $400 million, reflecting the tremendous work the team has done over the last several years to strengthen this business. GM Financial once again delivered strong results with Q3 EBT adjusted of $900 million, down $200 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income. Overall, GM Financial's balance sheet and credit metrics remain healthy, reflecting the strong underlying credit quality of the portfolio. Although moderating off historically strong levels, net charge-offs remain below pre-pandemic levels as credit mix has shifted towards prime customers. Corporate expenses were $350 million in the quarter, up $100 million year-over-year, primarily driven by growth initiatives. Corporate also included $100 million gain relating to the disposition of our Stellantis warrants, which we exercised in Q3 when the lockup period expired and resulted in approximately $1.1 billion of cash proceeds. Cruise expenses were $500 million in the quarter, up $200 million year-over-year, driven mainly by modifications to share-based awards, resulting in an accounting change in compensation expense. Now let me provide a few forward-looking comments. We continue to track to the midpoint of the $13 billion to $15 billion EBIT-adjusted range we laid out at the beginning of the year. Year-to-date, we're at $10.7 billion EBIT adjusted, which implies Q4 EBIT adjusted in the low $3 billion range. Slightly higher wholesale volumes from completing the remaining vehicles held at company inventory are expected to be more than offset by a normalizing mix, launch-related costs and typical seasonality we see in Q4. We estimate commodity and logistics costs to be around $5 billion headwind year-over-year, consistent with prior expectations. Earlier in the year, raw materials were driving around two-thirds of this $5 billion increase. They have come down and are now closer to half, but this benefit has been offset by other costs such as logistics and supplier claims. We're working collaboratively with our suppliers to jointly identify efficiencies to help mitigate these headwinds. As we move into 2023, we continue to see the dynamics between commodities and pricing as a natural hedge that should trend in similar directions, helping to maintain the earnings power of the company. We also continue to see strong demand for our products, and we'll remain thoughtful in our approach to pricing. We've been agile through this volatile environment over the last couple of years. And as we said last quarter, we're already taking proactive steps to manage costs and cash flows, including reducing some discretionary spending and limiting hiring the critical needs and positions that support growth. In summary, we continue to execute on our near-term financial goals. But more importantly, we're making great progress on the milestones we shared last year. And then just -- we'll have the opportunity to update you at our Investor Day in New York on November 17. This concludes our opening comments. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. John, your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning guys. And thanks for all the detail. Just a first question around inventory, and I'll promise to state a one follow-up to this. I mean, if we think about 359,000 of units on dealer lots right now, you're saying that's about 20 days supply. I mean, just curious, how you think about governing that going forward, so you maintain this very strong price environment, which is driving record profitability. I'm just trying to make sure we stay at tight levels. And how do you think about staying tight to support pricing. Paul Jacobson : So, Mary, I\u2019ll take\u2026 Mary Barra : Yeah. Go ahead, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Apologies. Well, thanks for that question, John. So we're watching this very, very closely as we've said, looking at dealer turn times, looking at grounded stock. As we've talked about, logistics remain a bit of a challenge for us, whether it's vehicles that are completed, waiting transit to dealers, or even some vehicles that we've had some challenges getting across the next quarter from our facilities down there. So a lot of this inventory still is in transit. The grounded inventory, we continue to speak to our dealers. They say demand is really strong, and many dealers are saying that the only time vehicle sit there when a buyer opts out of a transaction they already had. And it's not very long before they go through their list and find somebody to purchase them. So this is something that we're watching very closely. I think there's a little bit of a surge right now as we complete the vehicles that were partially built at the end of June. But we watch this. We're seeing no signs of concern in the short run. John Murphy : Okay. And then, just a follow-up then on tightness. I mean, cap U -- in the quarter, I think you said in North America is 103.3%, two shifts straight time. That kind of implied capacity of about 3.1 million units. If we look back to some period that was somewhat normal in the third quarter of 2020, it's hard to call anything the last couple of years normal, but kind of normal, that cap was 112%, and your GM&A EBIT margins were 15%, right? So this quarter, we were over 11%. I'm just curious, as you think about ramping up that cap U curve, Mary, you've been doing this for a while and understand the stuff well. Is there room for margins, all else equal, as volumes recover and that cap U goes up, that you could see significant upside to margins over time? And where does that bend backwards? Is it 110%, 115%, 120% cap U? And would you add more capacity to help alleviate that sort of backward bend? Mary Barra : Well, John, I think, overall, we're going to remain disciplined. I do think there's an opportunity to drive strong margins. We're seeing it right now with the mix, for instance, on full-size trucks. Consumers continue to want a very high mix. We think that, that will translate also into EV. And as we move forward in the EV launch and have our battery plants operating and get to scale and continuing to make the battery improvements, we see, again, that's another level to have strong margins. And then sitting on top of that is, from a software perspective. And then, overall, beyond, I'll say, the traditional new vehicle sales, the work that we'll have with CarBravo as well as the growth businesses around GM Defense, BrightDrop and Cruise, I think there's quite a lot of upside from a margin perspective in the company. But to drill into the specific, we will be disciplined as possible. And the reason I say as disciplined as possible, we also do have to be responsive to what the competitive environment is. But I think we have -- I think there's -- as an industry, we've learned a lot over this last couple of years of how we can be more efficient between ourselves and the dealers and how we can make sure we're serving the customer in an efficient way. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much, guys. Operator :  [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph, your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thanks so much. Good morning everyone. Mary or Paul, maybe you could just give a little bit more color on what's going on at the -- it sounds like the battery factories are sort of causing a slight delay there. Is that sort of a timing of some equipment coming in or some extra steps in terms of making sure the quality is there? Maybe just a little bit more color on that. Mary Barra : Sure, Joe. Well, one, I think we had a very aggressive launch plan when we started to build the plant. Let's step back and recognize that the Ohio plant is the size of 30 football fields, and it will employ over 1,000 people. Making sure we had all our people there and trained has taken a little longer than expected. Also, this is the first facility that we're working with LGES, and we're working together effectively to really leverage not only the expertise that LGES has, but what GM brings. And so there's no one thing, but it has just taken a little longer to make sure that we're able to produce with quality. I'm very confident in the team and how they're working together. And I think we're in that ramp, but because it's taken a little bit longer. Also from the battery pack assembly as well, both of those, as we've ramped up are taking a little bit longer. And that's why instead of hitting the 400,000 mark at the end of 2023, it's going to seep into 2024. But with everything that we're learning, it gives me great confidence that we're going to be able to start plant two, three and beyond on time. And I have greater confidence in our ability to scale to the 1 million units of annual EV capacity in 2025 in the US and similarly in China. So it really is just that first plant up and going, recognize the size and complexity of it. But I'm really proud of the team of where they're at right now. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thanks for that. And maybe somewhat related, but Paul, I know CapEx was sort of reiterated at $9 billion to $10 billion for the year. You're trending well below that through nine months. So is that still correct? I mean, is there any incentive to push some of that to next year because of maybe some of the policy changes? And also, I guess, with the policy changes, any thoughts on if that $9 billion to $10 billion is still the right rate for the next couple of years, or are you actually incentivized to maybe try to accelerate some of that now? Paul Jacobson : Well, Joe, I think when you look at our historical spend rates, we tend to have CapEx that -- it's a little bit back-loaded from that standpoint. And I think we're still on track for the $9 billion to $10 billion going forward this year. As we look at the future years, obviously, we've had some pretty steep acceleration in EV volumes, et cetera. And we'll provide some more updates at Investor Day. But I think we're well within our ability to fund our expansion, our transformation through internally generated funds when you look at the health of the business. And I think when you look at cash balance, when you look at cash flows, when you look at our ability to repurchase some shares during the quarter, that signals our confidence about being able to balance the spending, be aggressive where we can, as you've seen us over the last couple of years, but also keep that balanced within our means. And you're going to continue to see that from us. Joseph Spak : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Rod, your line is open. Rod Lache : Good morning. Wanted to ask first, Mary. I overheard you say in an interview this morning that GM is well positioned for the IRA. I was hoping you can give us maybe some color on the magnitude of the North America content and critical mineral sourcing or the manufacturing credits as you look out to next year? And related to this, your original margin targets sort of mid-term and long-term, the 10% and 12% were pre-IRA. And I'm curious, if you have any thoughts on whether this could be accretive to that. Mary Barra : Sure. Well, just to maybe touch on that last point. We believe we are very well positioned. And we think we're waiting for the treasury rules to be finalized, but we think it will accomplish. So it positions us with our strong EV portfolio covering the important segments to really drive affordability to spur adoption. So, overall, we feel very well positioned. But if you look at it right now, over the 10-year life cycle of the credit, we will offer a number of models in the segments and price ranges that will be eligible for the full $7,500 credit. And for us, many of these are going to be high-volume entries. We do think some of the vehicles will be eligible for the $3,750 credits starting in January, and then we'll ramp toward full qualification across the broad portfolio in two to three years as some of the different supply comes online in North America or in the United States. We also think there's a significant opportunity to potentially leverage the tax credit of up to $45 per kilowatt hour with respect to battery cells and battery modules produced in the US. So that's another opportunity where, again, I think, we're better positioned than most because of our aggressive plan to get the battery plants and the pack assembly in this country. And then, we do think we see an opportunity for our suppliers to leverage a tax credit for up to 10% of the cost of the US source battery electrode active materials, starting in January of next year. So that's just a little bit more color. Again, we'll have vehicles that are in the right MSRP range to qualify. So when you look at it overall, there's the commercial incentives also that will support BrightDrop in the fleet and rental car. There's the used EV purchase incentive that we think will support EV resell values. And again, we have CarBravo. And then the elements from a manufacturing granted loans. So that's just a little bit of the detail. Again, we're waiting for the final rules from treasury, but I think you can see this will really go a long way to helping us drive affordable EVs and drive our profitability, while even hitting some of the lower MSRPs. Rod Lache : Thanks, Mary. That's helpful. And Paul, on your last call, you mentioned that the next recession would be characterized by risk to pricing as opposed to volume. I mean, since then, rates have obviously gone up and trade-in values have moderated. And even though you have a lot of in-transit inventory, it looks like the aggregate inventory is probably climbing in the 50 to 60-day range. I was hoping, maybe, that you can give us a little bit of additional color on how you see that playing out? Whether you think we shift from supply constraints to demand constraints or any color on this commodity hedge that you mentioned during your prepared remarks? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks, Rod. So, I think, it's obviously -- we've seen some increases in inventory, but that's not a surprise. I think, we wholesaled rounding off rounding to 1 million vehicles during the quarter, as evidence of both producing and clearing out the vehicles that hadn't been finished in June. So, I think, we're working through that right now. I think, it's too soon to conclude anything about trends. We do know that there's a lot of pent-up demand from the last couple of years as evidenced by both MSRPs as well as what turn rates have been doing. So we're watching all of that closely, but I haven't come to any conclusions about any softening or any demand that's occurred today. I think as you look at the dealer statistics as well as GMF, the people that are clamoring to get in our vehicles and still see high demand, particularly for the full-size trucks and SUVs. Rod Lache : Thanks. Anything on that commodity hedge, Paul, that you mentioned? What -- you just concluded you're steel negotiations? Is that -- do you have any measure of the magnitude of that offset? Paul Jacobson : Yes, nothing specific today, Rod. I mean, keep in mind that obviously, when you look across all of the commodities, they've come off their highs, which will benefit some tailwind next year. As it relates to steel, remember, we've got a portfolio approach where some is on spot rate, some are on term contracts. We benefited from that as steel was spiking over the last couple of years, but you'll see some lag, particularly in steel from some of those multiyear contracts, which is fine over the long-term. But it won't provide as big of a tailwind next otherwise would. So we'll get more detail on that as we give full year 2023 guidance later, but nothing specific now. Rod Lache : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay, your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody and congrats on the results. Maybe just to follow-up on that last question, Paul. Just it sounds like you do think that pricing, net of commodities, can still be, I guess, intact or neutral into next year. Maybe -- just maybe hoping you can elaborate on that last comment from your prepared remarks. And maybe also talk about the opportunities you see with the HD trucks and the midsized trucks you're launching next year. It sounds like there might be some price opportunities for the company there as well. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Good morning, Itay. So I didn't necessarily say that it was going to be flat. I said it was going to be some going forward. We already do know about some pressure that's likely to hit next year from pension accounting. Keep in mind that while the funded status hasn't changed, just the differentiation of a very different rate environment is going to cause some headwinds on the pension side. We'll know more as rates settle out at the end of the year, but that could be north of $1 billion. No change to cash, no change to any funding just the way they work. So we're watching all that. That's why we're -- necessarily piecemeal, all of this stuff going forward. But we'll provide more with our full year guidance. And obviously, when you look at the launches of the new HD, there's a lot of content rich. Vehicles coming out. We've continued to see those in strong demand as we rolled them out, both across the SUVs and the light-duty pickups as well. So we expect to see some demand coming there as customers can't get them fast enough. So we think that there is some good news out there. All of that has to be balanced by every -- that others are seeing out there, even if we're not seeing it, which is why we continue to be cautious in our approach. But what we're focused on is executing every day. And I think this quarter demonstrates the power of the team's ability to do that. Itay Michaeli : That's very helpful. And maybe a follow-up for Mary and Kyle. Any update on when we should see the deployment of the Cruise Origin next year? Is that more first half or second half? And then, Kyle, when those Origins are deployed, what's your targeted ODD in San Francisco at that time? Mary Barra : Kyle, do you want to take that? Kyle Vogt : Sure. No problem. So to begin with, one of the things we did just recently is we started operating the Cruise Origin on the streets of San Francisco, but being driven manually for data collection. And so, that's another milestone as we ramp towards production for that vehicle, volume production next year. When we deploy initially, the ODD will probably look similar to what we're doing with our Bolts, but we're going to announce that a little later as we get closer to the deployment date for that vehicle. Itay Michaeli : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan, your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask on commodity costs. I realize it's a complicated equation with buy-ins deal in advance, compensating suppliers in the lag, some hedging. But just straight lining the latest spot prices through the end of 2023 would suggest to me a sizable tailwind next year. So, have you done any work to try to dimension this tailwind and maybe how it might compare in magnitude to any headwind you expect to face from higher non-commodity supply chain costs, such as energy, logistics, labor or other costs? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Ryan, again, I want to avoid getting into any specific commentary about 2023 guidance from that standpoint. Obviously, we are watching not just commodities, but logistics, container rates. Just overall, there's a lot of things that are moving around and changing and evolving. So if we see slowdowns in the economy, not only would we expect commodity rates to come down further, we'd expect freight rates to come down as well. We probably spend less on expedited premium freights that we've been spending, because the supply chain could normalize a little bit. But those are the things that we're working through in the budget. So what I'd ask is, give us time to go through that, take our Board through that. And we'll let you know as soon as we pull it all together for a plan in 2023. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, is there any color you can provide on potential settlements with suppliers to compensate them for premium non-commodity supply chain costs? Ford called this out as a $1 billion headwind during this quarter versus I didn't see anything in your release along those lines. I'm curious if you're taking a similar approach to settle more quickly, or maybe expect to spread these payments over several quarters, or just any thoughts you might be able to provide on how these negotiations with suppliers are progressing amidst the higher inflation environment and impact on GM going forward? Paul Jacobson : Yes, sure. So, obviously, I won't comment on any specific discussions that we're -- with our suppliers. But as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we had focused in on this as well as commodity prices, et cetera, as part of the $5 billion of pressure that we were going to see year-over-year. We've been talking about that all year. So the supplier world isn't new to us. It's not a surprise to us. It is, as we said in the prepared remarks, taking up a little bit more of that bucket than it was before on a percentage basis. But I think, overall, we're in control of that situation, working proactively with our suppliers and making sure we're doing it a way that meets their needs as well as meeting ours and the commitments we've made to the Street. So we won't talk about anything specific with it. It's in there. We've budgeted and planned for that, and there was no surprise from our side on what we've seen. And I think it speaks to the quality of the guidance that we've been able to highlight all year. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Mark, your line is open. Mark Delaney : I guess, good morning and thank you very much for taking the questions. The first one is on mix, and the company spoke to some mix normalization in the prepared comments. What do you think is driving that mix normalization? Is it more about what GM has the supply to be able to produce and that broadening out beyond the higher end, or are you seeing any pressure on mix related to what consumers are able to afford given the macroeconomic backdrop? Paul Jacobson : Nothing from the consumer side. I'd say that comment was really aimed towards the fact that we cleared out the vehicles that had been built without the components at the end of June. We talked about 75% of those being full-size trucks and SUVs. So it stands to reason that with only about 25% of that pool left, you'd see some balance. So it's really more due to production and full-size than it is anything on the consumer side. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. And my follow-up is on Cruise. And as Cruise is entering the scaling-out phase, and Kyle, thanks for all updates you shared on the progress Cruise is making, are you guys able to share any more color on how investors should expect investment levels accrues to trend going forward in order to support that ramp-up relative to the current level of investment? Thanks. Mary Barra : Kyle, I don't know if you want to comment. I mean, I'll just say, we roughly see it slightly higher than 2022 levels, and that's what we're building into the plan. Okay? Anything else, Mark? Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, your line is open. Adam Jonas : Thanks. I just had a follow-up on Cruise. Again, thinking quarterly, cash consumption was $0.5 billion this quarter, rolling out though into two new cities by the end of the year, further expansion. I just want to confirm, Mary, that if we kind of continue that quarterly run rate of 0.5, maybe increase it slightly, but not dramatically. Is that a fair assumption from here? Mary Barra : I think, yes, that's a fair assumption. And then remember, as we start to scale, we do have a line of credit for the vehicles from GM Financial. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Just a follow-up on GM Financial. While up slightly, the delinquencies, as you pointed out, still really low at 2.5% and net charge-offs below pre-pandemic levels. Just curious how you would describe the credit outlook for GM Financial. What changes are you making in your portfolio to prepare for further rises in rates and impact on portfolio performance? I figured it's an unusual environment given how much of the business has been order-booked. But correct me if I'm wrong, you're moving more into a kind of that -- at the margin to that just in time market that we're familiar with. There's still some order books. So I'd appreciate what you're hearing in real time from the dealers on the credit side. Thanks. Dan Berce : Hi. Yes, Adam, this is Dan Berce. Yes, first of all, as you point out, our credit metrics are really still quite strong. Pre-pandemic, our net losses ran in the 1.5% range. So they're less than half of that now at 70 basis points. For several years running now, our portfolio is skewed more and more to prime consumers, and that's defined as 680-plus FICOs. In fact, recent vintages have been 80% prime, and our whole portfolio now is 72% prime. It's also heavily new car finance related, which typically has been a stronger credit profile. Prime consumers, period, typically have a stronger balance sheet buffer, better income levels and historically have been more resilient in weaker economic times. As I said last quarter, to your question, our new car portfolio continues to perform substantially better than pre-pandemic levels. Our used car non-prime book is showing more normalization. And as always, we always look for targeted ways to improve our underwriting and now is no exception. So that would be the area of most focused, the used car non-prime book. That all being said, we overall expect some normalization in credit, especially with weaker economic conditions. But our reserve levels already contemplate that. And from a dealer standpoint, the through-the-door application flow really doesn't look different now with the on-the-run buyers as opposed to order book buyers. We haven't really seen any difference at the dealer level at all. Adam Jonas : Really appreciate that color. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel, your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you, very much and good morning. First, a quick follow-up on the delay in the battery ramp-up. Can you please remind us, which of the EV models were going to basically use cells from these plants you're ramping up? And therefore, we'll see some sort of delay in their volume ramp up? And, I guess, more broadly, how are you going to prioritize cell allocation over the next, call it, 18 months or so, when you're a bit more constrained than maybe expected? Mary Barra : Yes, Emmanuel. So because of the Ultium platform, we really have a lot of flexibility. So the cells coming from Ultium, which are now in production, will be flowing first to support HUMMER production. And we have over 90,000 orders there. And then LYRIQ, which we have really strong interest in both -- the two model years were already sold out for the availables and we have strong interest. But then as we get into next year, they'll be spread across also Silverado, Blazer and Equinox EVs for Chevrolet and some of our other models. So we will allocate them across all of those somewhat based on demand and as each of those plants ramp. And we'll make that somewhat dynamically as we go next year, but we'll spread them across all of those vehicles. And, again, this is just a slight shift in the acceleration as we get into 2024, because we'll have a plant coming online next year and the following year, you're going to see a steeper ramp. And that's what gives me great confidence in getting to the million units by 2025. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. Thanks for the color. And then, the follow-up was, if you could put a finer point on some of the demand trends you're seeing sort of real time, both in the US and China, if possible. Mary Barra : I think we've covered most of this. I'll start, Paul, and then if you want to add anything. I mean, again, we're still seeing very strong demand. I think what's specific to GM is, we have a very strong truck portfolio. If you look at what we have right now, we've refreshed the light-duty trucks. We have now not only the heavy duties coming out early next year, but we also have an all-new midsize truck. So I think that puts us in a very strong position with trucks. Regardless of what the environment is, I think we're going to have a very strong offering from a customer perspective and choice across the full range of those vehicles. We are still seeing strong ATPs, but we're watching carefully to see if and when they moderate, also balancing against incentives. We're going to continue, we think, to see some semiconductor challenges and, I'll say, overall challenges from the supply base. It's still very tight when you look at how long we've been running at that. Even a small hiccup usually has an impact. And so we're going to continue to work those issues, but we see that improving as well. So I think the big thing that we're looking at is what will demand be. There's still a lot of different predictions on what the economic situation will be. But I think, overall, from where we are from a low inventory perspective, strong product offering. And I think we're well positioned to manage through it. I don't know, Paul, if you want to add anything. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Mary, I'll just add that we're still very much in a production-constrained world as an industry against where demand is. And as we look to 2023, we've said publicly that we're kind of planning for a 15 million SAAR year, which is kind of below where most people peg demand, but it's actually of where actuals have been for most of the year, given some of those supply constraints. So I think everything Mary said is absolutely true. We're watching it very closely. We are planning for some tightness next year, but that's because we want to be on the proper side. We don't want to get surprised if we see that trending lower. So hopefully, demand remains strong going into 2023, and we can outperform the expectations that we're putting on paper right now. But that's -- 2023. Emmanuel Rosner : And then in China and the new ones there? Mary Barra : In China, I think we're -- as we now have the LYRIQ, we started offering the LYRIQ in September, and we'll have the Buick Ultium-based product. Those are two very important brands that we do well in China. I think we'll continue to see strength in the Hong Guang MINI EV. So I think the real opportunity for us in China is to now, with the products we have, grow our EV portfolio while maintaining our cost. And we'll look to see how the company or the country does from an economic perspective. But we have a strong portfolio coming from an EV perspective, and I'm really proud of what the team is doing in light of volatile and different headwinds that they face, especially with some of the COVID situation. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, your line is open. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Any color on pricing? I mean any color? Has it improved sequentially? I know that year-over-year, it's still quite a big tailwind. And should we expect it to stay strong? It just feels like there's an awful lot of headwinds out there. Rates are rising. Used car prices are falling. And I know you highlighted demand is strong, but a lot of the market data is a little cautionary. I think some of the dealers are saying pre-sold vehicles are sort of back to normal levels with the very -- being very few left, and inventory has ticked up and sales really haven't moved yet, which you would think the demand was there. So should we think pricing is going to have to move for you in the industry to kind of keep the demand flowing? Paul Jacobson : So, Colin, I'll take a shot. Mary, you can add anything. Certainly, I think this comes down to the question of how much pent-up demand is there, which I don't think is necessarily specifically knowable over time. But what we're really focused on is trends going forward and managing to those trends, as we have throughout this year. The customer has obviously been very resilient. And I think that speaks to the quality of our products and what they sought. So I don't think that piece is going to change. I think the industry could normalize. We could see that, although I don't think we see big increases in production going forward. So depending on how that pent-up demand shakes out, I think that will affect inventory. But what you're hearing from everyone in the industry -- learned in inventory management over the last couple of years. And we ourselves have cited some of that. So even if we assume some slight softness in 2023, as I talked about on the SAAR side, we're not seeing it as sort of a major shakeup. Colin Langan : Got it. And then, just following up on the questions around the IRA. Just for clarification, I think you said, you see, I think, over 10 years, the potential to get the full $7,500. I mean -- and then out the gate, you think you can get the $3,750 for sort of the battery component part of it. I mean is that -- I wasn't sure if the $7,500, there's also the commercial credits? Is the $7,500 just for retail buyers that you think is possible, because that sourcing part seems to be the most challenging to get at? Mary Barra : Yes. We think, out of the gate, we're going to be eligible for the $3,750, and we'll ramp to have full qualification in the next two to three years, getting up to the $7,500. So -- which positions us well to be eligible for the complete credit from the consumer perspective. The $7,500 one through the 10 years, it just takes a couple of years to ramp up based on our expectations with the supply moves that we've already made. And then, as I mentioned, there's also the -- to leverage the tax credit of up to $45 per kilowatt hour with battery cells and battery modules produced in the US. Again, we're well positioned there. And then the commercial incentives, I think, are going to be very important, especially with BrightDrop, our fleet and rental car. So those opportunities, as well as use used EV purchase incentives as well. So, again, we're waiting to see what treasury does from a rule perspective, but those are just a few of the opportunities we think we're well positioned for and, frankly, better than most. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our last question comes from James Picariello from BNP Paribas. James, your line is open. James Picariello : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just at a high level, the sequential walk to the full year adjusted EBIT midpoint of $14 billion, just curious if you could provide the major puts and takes to get to the midpoint. Obviously, it would be a sequential decline in the fourth quarter relative to a very strong third quarter. Yes, just any color there would be great. Mary Barra : Paul, do you want to take that? Paul Jacobson : Yes, sure. So, I would say, it starts with the wholesale, obviously, we had a really strong quarter as not only did -- were we able to produce, but we also cleared out 75% of that. So it was a little bit front weighted. If you recall back in the June quarter call, we talked about being 50-50 of clearing those out. So there's nothing sequentially different about the business that we're talking about. But I would expect that we cut wholesale a little bit, just off of the fact that we cleared out the majority of those vehicles from June. James Picariello : Okay. And just on that, in terms of the 25% to 30% wholesales growth, is there a bias towards the lower half of that range based on how supply chains are shaping up and how the third quarter came in, or how should we think about that? Paul Jacobson : Yes. No specific commentary on that range, as Mary highlighted, we -- while the chip and the logistics environment is generally improving, there are still some short-term impacts that we digest on a regular basis. And the team does a good job of working through though, but I wouldn't want to get more specific than the 25% to 30%. James Picariello : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. End of Q&A: Mary Barra : Well, thank you, Madison. And I just have a couple of comments to close the call. First and foremost, I hope everyone is hearing that the entire team is focused on meeting our commitments and just driving results that support the rapid scaling of our EV business and driving continued strong margins. I think over the last two years, especially, we've demonstrated resiliency and the ability to manage headwinds, many times that have even been stronger than we've seen in the past. And going forward, we'll continue to show that agility and resiliency and adjust whenever we need to do what we need to do to stay on track. And so I'm very confident of our transformation that's underway, and I think next year is a big year for us. You'll hear at our Investor Day in November much more about the EV strategy, including the KPIs. So I hope you will attend. And Paul, Kyle, Dan and I thank you for the questions today, and we look forward to seeing many of you there, and again, couldn't be more committed to where we are, clearly in execution mode from a GM perspective with our EV/AV strategy. So thank you, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, January 31, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thanks Michelle and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2022. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today is Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; as well as Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements disclosure on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to begin today's call by recognizing the General Motors team, all of our employees and including our dealers and suppliers. It takes experience, skill land teamwork to adjust to external factors like higher interest rates, commodity price increases and supply chain disruptions and deliver our commitments year in and year out. Our team rose to meet every challenge thrown at them in 2022 and they delivered record EBIT-adjusted and a year of first that really sets us apart from our competition. For exam, GM led the U.S. industry in total sales and delivered the largest year-over-year increase in market share of any OEM alongside record ATPs. This reflects the strength of our product portfolio including our clear leadership in full-size pickups and full-size SUVs, great quality, and improved availability. Chevrolet and GMC delivered more than 1.1 million full-size pickups, full-size SUVs and mid-size pickups in the U.S. which is about 350,000 units more than our closest competitor. Our commercial fleet business is another area where we gain considerable, profitable market share. The team has earned a business of more than 300 major commercial accounts over the last several years which led to our best year for commercial deliveries since 2006. The inflexion point was driven by our investment in mid-size and full-size pickups including our capacity expansions to build more crew cabs and heavy-duty pickups. Our growing portfolio of EVs will enhance our strong sales and share performance across the board because we are targeting the most popular segment at multiple price points. This year we will have nine EVs in the market in North America including the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV which saw record sales. In fact they were the bestselling mainstream EVs in the second half of the year and we plan to build more than 70,000 this year for North America and other markets. Quality is another area where our team deserves recognition. In the latest J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study, GM improved while the industry went backwards. Not only did we get better, GM and the Buick brand led the industry. Chevrolet had six top-ranked vehicles and the Corvette was the highest-ranked nameplate in the industry. This commitment to satisfying customers and delivering industry leading quality, helped our eligible U.S. hourly employees earn record profit sharing totaling $500 million, which brings the three-year total to $1.2 billion. Looking ahead, we expect that 2023 will be another strong year for GM. We expect to deliver EBIT-adjusted in the range of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion which reflects operating performance similar to 2022 when you include the normalization of GM Financial's results and pension accounting. Our guidance includes a total of $2 billion in cost savings in the automotive business over the next two years. The areas we are focusing on include continuing to reduce complexity at all of our products and reducing corporate overhead expenses across the board. I do want to be clear that we're not planning layoffs. We are limiting our hiring to only the most strategically important roles and we will use attrition to help manage overall headcount. Colorado and GMC pickup, our new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Heavy-Duty pickups, and the all new Chevrolet Trax which is the best entry-level Chevrolet we ever built.: We are especially excited about the Trax and so are our dealers in North America, Korea and other international markets.: The third generation, Chevrolet Montana pickup that we're launching in South America and Mexico starting next month, follows the same formula. The Montana's design is inspired by products like the Blazer and Trailblazer, and it will offer customers more room, the best combination of fuel economy and performance in its segment, and a comprehensive suite of safety features and an innovative reconfigurable bit. So let's talk about our growing EV portfolio. At our November Investor Day, we took you deep into the products and supporting strategies that will help us achieve solid EV profitability in 2025 and this is a breakout year for the Ultium Platform. Production at our Ultium Cells joint venture in Ohio is on track and the plant in Spring Hill will open later this year. Ultium Cells started hiring and training launch team members in October and they began equipment installation in November. These plants will help us meet pent up demand for the Cadillac LYRIQ. The GMC HUMMER EV pickup, and the BrightDrop Zevo 600, and it keeps our other EV launches on track. For example, BrightDrop continues to add new customers, including DHL Canada and they are on track to achieve the goal of $1 billion in revenue for the year. Excuse me. In April, we launched the Silverado EV work truck at Factory Zero for fleets. So we have opened up the order banks to begin converting initial demand for more than 200 customers into firm orders for 2023 production with the first deliveries in the spring. Interest is so strong that we believe demand will exceed supply in 2023 and into 2024. In the fall we will begin building the sold out Silverado RST First Edition, Chevrolet's flagship electric pickup, which will feature trailing capable super crews, four-wheel steering and a multi-flex midgate and up to 400 miles of range. We'll follow with other retail focused models in 2024, including the Silverado EV Trail Boss. This summer will also see the launches of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Equinox EV. More than 40% of Blazer's reservation holders are new to EVs. Among the 60% who have owned an EV or hybrid, most are either Tesla customers or are our loyal Bolt EV and Bolt customers. What's common to everyone is they want an all-electric SUV that's stylish and roomy with enough range and fast charging capability to make it their daily driver, and they want it from a brand like Chevrolet with a proven record and reputation for quality. The Equinox EV has many of the same attributes and an even more affordable package, which makes it unique and another growth opportunity for GM. More than one third of the customers interested in the Equinox EV say affordability is their key consideration, and the latest data says nearly half live on the east or west coast or in Texas, which are all growth markets for us. This cadence of self-production and product launches combined with strong demand for the Bolt EV and EUV keeps us on track to produce 400,000 EVs in North America from 2022 to mid-2024 with the Ultium platform, volumes increasing significantly in the second half of this year. Electra: All of these launches and initiatives will help us deliver near-term commitments we made at Investor Day, and we continue to make bold moves to drive profitable long-term growth. One example is our planned investment of more than $850 million in four U.S. plants to build the sixth generation of our Small Block V8, which will deliver even better fuel economy, about a 5% improvement and double digit reduction in emissions and more performance for our truck and SUV customers. We're also building an EV supply chain that is long-term competitive advantage for GM and a major source of new jobs, especially in North America. For example, our first three joint venture cell plants are expected to create 11,000 jobs in the U.S. with about 6,000 in construction and 5,100 in operations. In Quebec construction of our joint venture Cathode Active Material plant is moving quickly and the structure should be complete mid-year. In Texas, MP Materials has started construction of its first rare earth metal alloy and magnet manufacturing facility, and they expect to begin delivering product to us late this year. After several months of optimizing engineering and process parameters, Controlled Thermal Resources is now recovering lithium from its geothermal brine resource in California's Imperial County. This is an important step in completing the engineering design to recover lithium from geothermal brine at scale. In Australia, Queensland Pacific Metals has secured all major approvals to begin construction of a new facility that will be an environmentally sustainable center for processing nickel and cobalt. In December, Ultium Cells signed a supply agreement with POSCO Chemical to source artificial graphite from Korea. And today we announced the largest ever investment by an automaker and battery raw materials. Specifically, we are making an equity investment of up to $650 million in Lithium Americas to help them develop the largest known lithium resource in the U.S. and the third largest globally. Lithium Americas estimates that the potential output from this project could support annual production of up to a million EVs and create a thousand new jobs in construction and another 500 in operations. Production is scheduled to start in the second half of 2026, and after our initial investment, GM will have exclusive access to the lithium off-take in the first phase of the project. It's a landmark transaction and it certainly won't be the last major supply chain announcement for GM. We continue to pursue strategic supply agreements and partnerships to further secure our long-term needs and drive investment in the United States and across North America. As I said, all of these launches and initiatives tie back to the roadmap we shared at Investor Day. We're executing a product strategy in ICE and EV that is designed to support strong pricing and grow our share, especially in EVs by competing in multiple segments and price points. We're expanding domestic cell production to drive EV growth, and we are turning our EV supply chain into a powerful competitive advantage, and we're maintaining strong financial results during a period of high investments, which includes taking a very strategic approach to managing our costs. Next, I would like to dedicate a few minutes to Cruise because 2022 was a very significant year for them as well. So Kyle, I'm turning it over to you. Kyle Vogt : Robotaxi: We started the year with just a handful of cars on the road and a service that was restricted to employees. In January, though, we welcomed our first public riders and a few months later launched our commercial service, the first ever in a major U.S. city. And since then, we're approaching 1 million driverless miles, have completed tens of thousands of driverless rides and run the largest driverless AV operation in the world, currently peaking at 130 driverless AVs at the same time in our RedHill fleet. We've scaled responsibly, safely and transparently, including the release of the most comprehensive safety report in the industry. It outlines the key tenets and processes we put in practice each day that make our products an obvious choice against a backdrop of tragedies on the road caused by human error. We finished the year delivering on our promise, a bold one, to complete our first commercial driverless rides in Austin and Phoenix. In Austin, we went from zero footprint to revenue generating rides in just a few months, and this proves that our technology scales quickly to new regions with minimal modifications to our investment. And I think at this point, it's fair to say that our focus on complex cities like San Francisco doing that first has paid off and we've opened the door to rapid scaling this year and beyond. Looking ahead, this is the year when we really hone in on our key enablers for growth and profitability with our amazing experience, low cost available everywhere. We're going to expand our service in both existing and new markets, and we'll have more to come on this soon and we're working to ensure that our riders have an experience that is not only better than traditional ride hail, but the best transportation experience possible. The Origin will go into volume production later this year with closed course testing underway right now, and I can say after riding in an autonomous Origin myself, I can say that it's going to be hard to go back to conventional vehicle format for an AV. And as part of driving down costs and increasing availability, you'll also see us to continue to improve our operational efficiency and scale. And as an example, the most recent 100,000 driverless miles that we did clocked in eight times faster than the first hundred thousand miles that we did, and we expect our rapid expansion to continue at similar rates this year and next. Our operational efficiency also extends to how we spend our cash. We continually look for creative ways to reduce expenses, including more recently increasing our use of automation, increasing our cloud compute efficiency, and reducing our R&D real estate footprint. Our major investments in lower costs vehicles and hardware, such as the Cruise Origin, better routing and pricing algorithms and operational efficiencies are going to drop costs and improve our unit economics as we scale to more cities, drive up revenue and continue our march toward profitability. We'll be thoughtful and focused with our spending, but we do intend to pursue the massive market opportunity in front of us by significantly increasing our commercial footprint and operating scale. It's abundantly clear that we have a massive opportunity ahead of us and it's fully within our reach. We will continue to go out after it with integrity and with urgency. Thanks, Mary, back to you. Mary Barra : Well, thanks Kyle, and now let me turn the call over to Paul, who is going to go into a detailed discussion of our results and our outlook. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. I also want to start my remarks by thanking the entire GM team. They remain focused on execution and consistently meeting our commitments no matter the obstacles, and this is exactly what they achieved in 2022. We generated full year revenue of $156.7 billion, representing strong year-over-year growth of 23%. This improvement was driven by the team overcoming numerous logistics challenges and collaborating with the supply chain to increase parts availability. As a result, we grew wholesale volumes 25% within our objective of 25% to 30% for the year. We continue to face some supply chain and logistics issues, but overall things remain trending in the right direction. For the full year, we achieved $14.5 billion in EBIT-adjusted 9.2% EBIT-adjusted margins, and $7.59 in EPS diluted-adjusted. These results were above the record profits we achieved in 2021 and at the high end of our revised EBIT-adjusted guidance range of $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion as December revenue and FX came in better than expected. They also speak to the robust health of our underlying business, which allowed us to offset $5.5 billion of commodity and logistics headwinds, $2 billion of incremental EV and growth spend, and $1 billion lower GM financial results. We generated adjusted free cash flow of $10.5 billion, which allowed us to both reinvest in growth opportunities and return excess cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchase an additional $1 billion of stock, bringing the 2022 total to $2.5 billion and retiring 65 million shares. We also opportunistically early retired $1 billion of senior unsecured notes in the U.S. and $0.5 billion of unsecured term loans in GM International, both maturing in 2023. Our goal remains to be responsible stewards of your capital. Getting into the fourth quarter results, revenue was $43.1 billion, up 28% year-over-year. We achieved $3.8 billion in EBIT-adjusted 8.8% EBIT-adjusted margins, and $2.12 in EPS diluted-adjusted. These results were driven by solid unit volume growth of 30% year-over-year during the quarter and robust pricing. North America delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion year-over-year, and EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.3%, primarily driven by higher volume and pricing, partially offset by mix and higher commodity and logistics costs. Production in the second half of 2022 increased with strengthening supply chain and logistics, allowing us to improve dealer inventory for certain vehicles. We ended the year with total dealer inventory, including in-transit vehicles running around 50 days with the number of vehicles physically on dealer lots improving gradually, but still approximately one third the level we were at in mid-2019, supporting a favorable supply and demand environment. I'd also like to share our perspective on inventory levels going forward. We are committed to actively managing production levels to balance supply with demand, and are targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory on a portfolio basis. This is down 20 to 30 days from mid-2019 and is reliant on a continued improvement in logistical challenges the industry has faced. Within this portfolio target, trucks are expected to run at higher levels, reflecting greater customer driven variation requirements, and sedans and SUVs are expected to run at this range or lower. Throughout the year, sales seasonality, production schedules and timing of fleet deliveries may take us out of this range from time to time, but that is the targeted range at which we'll manage. We continue to see strong demand for our EVs with inventory turning on the Bolt EV and EUV in less than 10 days. The GMC HUMMER EV and Chevrolet Silverado EV have generated incredible demand and excitement leading to over 250,000 combined reservations. We've also seen strong demand for the Cadillac LYRIQ, GMC Sierra EVs as well. Edition 1 : GM International delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, flat year-over-year, as the team did an impressive job executing in a volatile environment. This included $200 million of equity income in China, down slightly year-over-year due to lower volume and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost actions. EBIT-adjusted in GM International, excluding China equity income was a $100 million, up slightly year-over-year and profitable in all four quarters. These consistent results were driven by favorable pricing and volume, partially offset by mix and commodity costs. I want to take a moment and recognize the transformation this team has executed over the last few years, achieving over $2 billion of EBIT-adjusted improvements since 2018. This was done by exiting unprofitable markets, strengthening the portfolio, leveraging our strong brands to significantly improve pricing and mix, all while simultaneously driving down costs. They've done amazing work as a team and they should be lauded for that. GM Financial delivered strong results with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $800 million, down $400 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower net lease vehicle income and higher cost of funds, partially offset by growth in the retail and commercial loan portfolios. Used vehicle prices have declined but continue to run above the contract residual value with a Q4 off lease return rate below 10%. Overall portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix with net charge-offs up slightly due to moderation and credit performance, but still running below pre-pandemic levels. GM Financial paid dividends of $1.7 billion in 2022, and we expect similar dividends in 2023. Corporate expenses were $400 million in the quarter, flat year-over-year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives and drive productivity. Cruise expenses were $500 million in the quarter, up $200 million year-over-year, driven mainly by modifications to equity awards resulting in an accounting change in compensation expense. Our optimism continues to grow based on the great progress Cruise made in 2022, and their plans for rapid scaling and operationalizing of the business will result in a modest increase in cost during 2023. Let's now look towards 2023 for GM overall, which I know is a key focal point for everyone. While the environment remains uncertain, at a high level I'm pleased to report that when you exclude the impacts of lower pension income and GM Financial contribution, we expect to drive consistently strong core auto operating performance in 2023. This continues the trend we saw in 2022 and highlights the strong execution throughout the organization. Our plan is to continue to prioritize growth initiatives such as Cruise and BrightDrop, while investing to accelerate our transition to EVs to take advantage of our vertical integration and local sourcing strategies. Assuming a 15 million total industry volume and under current conditions, we expect EBIT-adjusted in the $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion range, EPS diluted-adjusted in the $6 to $7 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $5 billion to $7 billion range. At GM Financial the strong credit performance in historically high used vehicle prices resulted in extraordinary results over the last two years. For 2023, we expect earnings to normalize in the mid $2 billion range. We expect volume and mix combined to be a slight tailwind with volumes up 5% to 10% year-over-year, and mix partially offsetting as we continue to increase production in the sedan, small SUV and crossover segments along with GM International volume growth. Regarding North America pricing, while we anticipate incentives will increase from the record low levels we saw in 2022, we expect this headwind to be partially offset by realizing the full year benefit of MSRP increases on many model year 2023 vehicles, particularly full-sized SUVs and trucks, as well as pricing we expect to achieve on our new launches in 2023. We're also anticipating pricing actions outside North America primarily to help offset FX headwinds. Overall, we see commodities and logistics costs as a slight tailwind. Our longer-term steel and logistics contracts, which help protect us from higher market costs over the last two years, renewed at higher rates in the second half of last year. This combined with the strategic initiatives to locally source battery raw materials is expected to largely offset the tailwind we're seeing from lower raw material prices on our spot and indexed exposures. The $1 billion lower pension income impacts our fixed costs. This non-cash item does not impact our core auto operating results, but will be a headwind when comparing year-over-year in 2023. As Mary mentioned, we are very focused on keeping automotive controllable fixed costs in check despite our growth initiatives, which is why we are announcing a cost reduction program to take out $2 billion of costs over the next two years. Included in our guidance is the expectation to achieve 30% to 50% of that in 2023 and the remainder in 2024. This initiative is the result of several factors and demonstrates our continued commitment to closely manage our operations through this transformation and achieve North American margins in the 8% to 10% range through 2025. We expect capital spend to be in the $11 billion to $13 billion range inclusive of $1 billion invested in our Ultium Cells JV. We continue to shift resources to EVs with around 75% of our product specific capital dedicated to EVs and AVs. Even with the increase in capital spending, we expect our adjusted free cash flow to remain strong in 2023. As we said back in November, we expect that clean energy tax credits will be a material tailwind for GM over time because of the work we've been doing on vertically integrating the supply chain. For 2023, we anticipate at least $300 million in EBIT-adjusted benefit and expect this tailwind to increase significantly over the next few years as our cell production ramps and our North America focused supply chain comes fully into place. We're closely monitoring the dynamic macro environment as well as customer demand to make sure we're appropriately matching supply with demand. We will take quick and decisive actions on both the supply and the cost side to actively manage the business. What gives us confidence in our 2023 and long-term objectives is the work we've already done to position ourselves for success, repeatedly executing on our commitments and our ability to manage through a very challenging and dynamic environment. With a compelling EV and ICE product portfolio, long-term supply chain commitments, extraordinary manufacturing capabilities, a strong balance sheet, and our amazing team, I'm confident we'll continue to enhance the customer experience and deliver compelling growth on both the top and the bottom line. Mary? Mary Barra : Okay, so with that, I think we're ready operator to start taking your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Dan Ives with Wedbush. You may go ahead, sir. Daniel Ives : Yes, thanks. A great quarter. Can you just talk about supply in terms of from a battery and lithium perspective? It just seems like you guys have being much more aggressive, making sure you have that supply through 2025. Just talk about some of those efforts and just giving you more and more confidence on the sort of EV targets over the coming years? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes, good morning, Dan. I'm really proud of what the team has done. You know, our collaborative effort across supply chain finance, business development have led to a, what I think is the strongest portfolio of battery raw materials going forward. We've fully secured all of our battery raw materials through 2025 and as you can see from the announcement today with the investment in Lithium Americas and the supply that we'll be able to get from the Thacker Pass, we're making rapid improvements and increases in our battery raw materials for 2026 and beyond. That is core to our strategy. What we've done, we've talked about being creative because what we're really trying to do is to create a portfolio that is in it for the long-term. So whether it's a combination of spot price movements, fixed price contracts across the board, we're looking at ways to creatively manage that and make sure that we're running it as a partnership. We want our partners to be successful too, especially in this space as we're developing new sources of these raw materials and this is such a great example of that partnership mentality coming to fruition. Daniel Ives : Thanks. And then just a quick follow up. You know, obviously price cuts that we've seen Tesla, Ford, but it doesn't seem like GM is going down that path. Can you just hit on that concept? You know, that's a big focus of investors. Mary Barra : Sure. When we look at our strong product portfolio and the interest that we have at the prices that we've already announced, we feel that we're well positioned. Even going into the first month of the year, we've seen a very strong customer interest in our products and so we think right now we're priced where we need to be. Of course we're going to monitor it and we'll make sure we remain competitive, but we really think with the strength of our product portfolio and what we have coming, we're positioned well. Daniel Ives : Thanks, congrats. Mary Barra : Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Dan. Operator : Thank you. And our next caller is Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead, sir. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to maybe just first follow up on Dan's question. Look, I know based on the prices that you've laid out for Equinox, Blazer, LYRIQ, that demand for the near-term is much greater than your ability to supply. But at the same time you're only assuming double or low single digit EBIT margin for EVs by mid-decade. And one of your peers is already at 20% gross and pretty healthy EBIT and their costs are still falling. So my question is whether there are changes that you're contemplating or that you could make to close in on that benchmark and generate similar margins any faster? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Rod, Paul and thanks for the question. Thanks for being on. You know, I think it's important to note that as we look across the competitive landscape, that competitor you referenced wasn't there in the beginning either, right? There's a lot of scaling that we're doing across the board. So as we're running concurrent operations with ICE and EV there's obviously some frictional costs on utilization, et cetera, that we expect to be able to scale as we go through this transformation. The ICE portfolio remains really strong, but we're also building the EV factories for the future. And clearly the production levels that we see now and as we're ramping up aren't there yet. So we expect a tremendous level of operational synergies. We're also going to manage the business aggressively. I think the $2 billion cost reduction program that we're announcing today is a strong testament to that and making sure that we're driving efficiencies as we ramp up those productions. So it's not a, I don't think a direct apples-to-apples comparison, but one that we're obviously aware of. On the pricing front the demand is really, really strong for all of our vehicle programs going forward and we feel good about where we're going in the trajectory that we're on. Rod Lache : Okay. Thank you. And just secondly the -- you referenced that $2 billion cost savings, what does that mean for structural cost expansion? And may be related to that, this 5% to 10% volume assumption that you've suggested would seem to imply that you don't see affordability or rates as a major impediment to growth at this point? Am I interpreting that correctly, or are you in fact making more room for pricing with this cost saving assumption? Paul Jacobson : I would characterize it a little bit differently, Rod. So success is going to be driven by, when we look at our fixed cost lines being down $2 billion, that's what we're looking for across the board, and we can get there and I think it comes across all areas of the business. What I would say is we're being prudent about what we see out in the macro environment. Again, we continue to see strength in demand for our vehicles and strength in pricing. But we want to make sure that we're driving efficiency where we can and felt like this was the right time to be able to do that. So we're going to be measuring how we do it. We're still focused on the growth areas of the portfolio, but we recognize that there are ways that we can do things more efficiently and we expect to be able to drive that into margin performance. We\u2019re not doing anything to prepare for a price war or we\u2019re not doing anything in anticipation of a recession. I would say, it\u2019s prudent cost management and just being aware of what\u2019s around us. Rod Lache : That number is net Paul; the $2 billion cost savings, or is that a gross savings objective? Paul Jacobson : Net of\u2026 Rod Lache : Well, in other words, is there, are your structural costs expected to decline by $2 billion expansion, I guess is a simple way to ask it, or is that, are there other things that are increasing offset that? Mary Barra : For our automotive business, we\u2019re expecting our structural costs to go down $2 billion. So it is that. Paul Jacobson : Full stop. Rod Lache : That is very clear. All right thank you. Paul Jacobson : Thanks. Mary Barra : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Thank you. And our next caller is Itay Michaeli from Citi. You may go ahead, sir. Itay Michaeli : Great, thanks. Good morning everyone, and congratulations. Just two questions on the outlook. First, can you maybe share kind of what you\u2019re expecting for the company\u2019s revenue growth in 2023 to just kind of want to calibrate that with the 12% CAGR for 2025? And secondly, I was hoping you could also maybe quantify the drag this year from some of the investments like the Ultium ramp and some of the other investments that you\u2019re making as well. It sounds like, while the guidance certainly looks robust, there\u2019s certainly a lot of investments still flowing through, so I was hoping maybe you could quantify that as well? And maybe also just provide a quick update on the Lordstown ramp as well? Mary Barra : So, Itay you were a little garbled, so let us try, I\u2019ll take the last one. The ramp at Ultium and Lordstown, Ohio is on track going well. The team is really ramping up, really focused on quality and the two between LG Energy Solution and General Motors working really well together. So I\u2019m very pleased. As I mentioned, Spring Hill is also on track, as is Michigan, and those three plants are really what enables us to achieve the goals that we\u2019ve set for getting to 2025 and a million units in North America. So that\u2019s all going really, really well. From a, I think the middle question you had was about, with the investments that we\u2019re making Ultium to quantify, I think, we\u2019ve talked about what those investments are, but they\u2019re part of our capital program that we announced last year, this year and going into next year, so that\u2019s part of it. And\u2026 Paul Jacobson : The first one was on the revenue growth Itay, so I\u2019ll just jump in and say that we obviously experienced pretty significant revenue growth in 2022, driven by 25% increase in wholesale. We\u2019re not expecting that similar jump in production in 2023. So we\u2019re not giving any specific revenue guidance, but I would say that we would expect the growth rate to be below 2022 levels in line volume. I Michaeli : Perfect. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Mary Barra : Thank you. Operator : And our next caller is John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good morning everybody. Just a first question, Mary on the IRA, I mean, there\u2019s a lot going on with the interpretation and the final rules being set here. Originally it looked like GM was going to be relatively advantaged just the way that you were set up on production in your supply chain, but some of the interpretations on the commercial vehicle side and the fact that leased vehicles may fit the bill of being commercial vehicles that may open the door to Europeans, Chinese, Japanese, South Koreans, anybody be shipping EVs into the U.S. and still getting a $7,500 credit. So just curious, what your thoughts are on that? How do you think the rules should be interpreted, and could there be the chance if this, loophole or change stays enforced that you might ship EVs in from China? Mary Barra : So our strategy all along for a very long time has been to build where we sell. And I think when you look at the work that we\u2019ve done with the battery plants in this country and all of the supply investments that we\u2019ve made, that helps us have I\u2019ll say supply chain resiliency more certain, it gives us the opportunity with some of the deals we\u2019ve made to, I think, have a better cost advantage. And also it\u2019s good for the country and creates jobs, and that\u2019s what IRA was meant to do. And so we\u2019re waiting to see what the final rules and are going to be from treasury. I think regardless of some of the issues still to be clarified from a lease perspective, General Motors is still going to benefit greatly because if you look at the production tax credits from sales and module perspective, and then where we\u2019ll be from a battery component in critical minerals, we think we\u2019re well positioned again. The deal that we announced today, or the partnership, the equity investment, I think continues to reinforce it. So yes, we\u2019re waiting to see what it is going to be, but our focus is on having a strong supply chain here. Obviously, when we get the final rules, we\u2019ll look because, we do have a global footprint, but I think we\u2019re focused on supporting North America production primarily from North America and to a certain extent from Korea. So again, we\u2019re waiting to see, but I think you have to go back to what the intent of IRA was. John Murphy : Yes, I agree with you. Just one followup, you mentioned fleet sales as an opportunity, fleet sales have been very low for the past couple years. I mean, fleets have been very under satiated or not satiated at all on their demand function. And now that supply is becoming more normal, how big a part of a recovery do you think they could have in the market just maybe in general where have they been for GM in 2021, 2022, and where do you think they might be in 2023? And how big a part did that play in sort of the development of EVs profitably into fleets in the early stages of the EV ramp? Mary Barra : Well, I think it\u2019s an important part, and I think when you look at BrightDrop, it\u2019s a true just all growth opportunity for us. I think when you look at the Silverado EV work truck, I think that\u2019s going to be very important as well. And so we\u2019re going to make sure that as we grow our fleet commercial rental business, it has an appropriate profitability profile, not from the days 10, 15 years ago when we really stepped back from that. But I think whether it\u2019s what we announced with Hertz and the number of customers that we have interested, every company is working to reduce their carbon footprint. And so the EVs that we have just to help support that I think are going to be very strong, and I think we\u2019re going to have a good portfolio. So I think that allows us to grow, especially in areas where we weren\u2019t involved in the past, EVs is a fresh start there. John Murphy : I\u2019m sorry, if you were to think about at 5% to 10% increase in wholesale volumes, would that be dominated by fleet? I\u2019m just -- because I mean everybody is obviously very concerned about the retail customer at the moment, but really neglecting that quarter of this market is traditionally fleet, and it\u2019s 10% to 15% in the last couple of years. So I mean, the potential doubling in fleet volume that can come in the market at large and maybe being very supportive of that wholesale increase. So I mean, could you give us some numbers or thoughts on how supportive that could be to that 5% to 10% wholesale increase? Mary Barra : I think when we talk about a 5% to 10% increase we\u2019re talking across the board. When you look at the EV launches that we have, the fact that we have brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups, the fact that we have the new midsize, which is just an outstanding midsized truck with the Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon as well as the Trax. So we think from an ICE perspective, we have an opportunity. We think from clearly the EV ramp-up that we\u2019re going to have this year; it\u2019s a part of it. And some of that -- both of those exciting products will be in the fleet business. So I think it\u2019s a both answer, John, not a single one or the other. John Murphy : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. With regard to the $300 million tailwind you are assuming from clean energy tax credits in 2023, I heard you say this could grow substantially over time. I just wanted to check in, try to dimension that potential. Are you assuming a benefit of $35 per kilowatt hour or $45? And are you in a position yet to share or have you resolved internally with your JV partner how these tax benefits are expected to be shared between GM and LG? I\u2019m just trying to dimension if the opportunity is 1 million vehicles in 2025, times $45 per kilowatt hour, $35, and then to understand whether we need to split that amount 50-50 or if there\u2019s some other math we need to take into account? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Ryan, a lot of detail in your question. I\u2019ll take it back to what we said at Investor Day was we expect EV benefits, tax benefits to be $3,500 to $5,500 per vehicle. The $300 million in 2023 is obviously a function of our ramp rate of our cell production. We\u2019re not going to go into any details on how that works across the board. It\u2019s our best expectation of where we\u2019re going to land is at least $300 million this year and ramping up rapidly as our production increases across our Ultium plants. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is James Picariello with BNP Paribas. You may go ahead sir. James Picariello : Hi, everyone. Just on back to the GM's EV pricing relative to the market in North America, how would you assess GM\u2019s price competitiveness given the latest moves by competitors? It sounds as though demand in your order books are quite full. But just given the more recent competitive responses by others it would be curious to get your take whether your GMC is the opportunity to reposition or we also have the IRA defined MSRP caps as well to consider. Thanks. Mary Barra : Sure. Well, I think that\u2019s the strength of what General Motors is planning to launch this year. Many of the products that we have are going to be below the caps because we have a full portfolio of EVs at multiple price points. When you think about the Equinox EV, the Blazer EV and then the Silverado as well as the LYRIQ, I think we\u2019re really well positioned. And these are brand-new products into the marketplace that we have really strong interest. So that\u2019s why both Paul and I feel that right now, based on the interest and the fact that the pricing that we put out even before the IRA came out, was very appropriate. We\u2019re going to -- and because of the strength of the Ultium platform, that\u2019s what enables us to do that along with the fact that we\u2019re ahead from most of the, I\u2019ll say, the traditional OEMs and getting battery cells produced in this country. So I think if you look at the strategy we\u2019ve been executing we\u2019re well positioned, and the strength of our product portfolio, I think is what is giving us the confidence to where we sit right now with feeling that we're priced appropriately. James Picariello : Understood. And then just within the 400,000 cumulative EV production target by the first half of next year, can you just mention what portion of that would be your EV truck platform? Mary Barra : We haven\u2019t provided that kind of specific analysis, but the fact that the HUMMER to begin with, and that will ramp significantly this year and even more next year as we\u2019re completely sold out. And then the Silverado that we think we\u2019re going to -- the Silverado EV work truck and then the RST [ph] comes at the -- toward the end of the year. I mean I think all of those are very significant products that are going to do very well, but we\u2019re not giving specific numbers. James Picariello : Understood. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes, good morning and thank you very much for taking the question. Is GM considering changes to its longer-term battery plans for North America has there have been media reports recently suggesting both the GM is considering adopting cylindrical cells and also the GM and LG may not partner on a fourth battery plant? Mary Barra : So first, one of the strong points of the LCM platform is that it\u2019s chemistry agnostic, and it can take pouch, prismatic or cylindrical cells. And so we can look to what is going to be the right battery for the specific vehicle from a performance perspective. So we have that complete flexibility. We have very important work going on with LG Energy Solution. They\u2019re an incredibly important partner to us. And we\u2019re working well together as we mentioned, with the launch of the Orion or excuse me, the Lordstown plant and then Spring Hill and then the plant in Michigan. So we\u2019re working well together, and we are going to need a fourth plant and more plants beyond that. And as we have those details to share, we will share them. But right now, there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s really changed in our plan to have battery manufacturing capability here in the U.S. and broadly in North America as well. Mark Delaney : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My second question was on Cruise and congratulations on the expansion into the new geographies last year. As you think about 2023 and I know you\u2019re planning to expand, could you elaborate a bit more on your expansion targets for Cruise? And any potential changes in San Fran given the recent feedback from the local government there? Thank you. Mary Barra : Kyle, do you want to take that one? Kyle Vogt : Yes, sure. I can take that. So we will be expanding in 2023 to several new cities, but our current focus is on expanding our driverless service in San Francisco as well as in Phoenix and Austin following our initial driverless launches there. The initial deployments in Phoenix and Austin were modest, and we want to expand those very quickly. And of course, by doing that, expanding into these new cities using this repeatable playbook we\u2019ve developed across safety and operations and some of the technical features, the barriers to launching in new cities can drive growth in existing markets are much smaller because of that upfront work we\u2019ve put into all of those really difficult barriers to scale first. And I think your second question was on the SFMTA comments about our California Public Utilities Commission permit to expand. And I just want to say there that our safety record is publicly reported and includes having driven millions of miles in an extremely complex urban environment with zero life-threatening injuries or fatalities and we\u2019re really proud of that record and also that the overwhelming majority of public comments on our permit application, including advocates from the disability community, small businesses and local community groups support expanding our fleet in San Francisco. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next caller is Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead sir. Adam Jonas : Hi, thanks everyone. I just want to follow up on Mark\u2019s question about the -- about Ultium and the form factor. I appreciate that there\u2019s room for flexibility. And you\u2019ve mentioned in the past, Mary, that the Ultium system was kind of form factor and chemistry agnostic. But if you did change to cylindrical, the 46/80 form factor as reported in some of these sources what kind of thing would drive such a change? I\u2019m not saying that you have made that decision, but it seems like it is potential -- there\u2019s potential to do that. What kind of -- would it be driven by safety or cost and kind of how difficult would it be to make that flip? Mary Barra : So first of all, I\u2019m not going to comment on speculation, Adam. And by the way, hello, but we -- we\u2019re looking really at performance. I mean, one of the things when you look at with the way that you configure the packs within Ultium, the difference of the cells is a lot having to do with performance and how do we get the max benefit. Again, our team has been working and looking at all three cell form factors for a while. In fact, today, from a prismatic perspective, that\u2019s what\u2019s in the vehicles, the Ultium-based vehicles that we\u2019re launching like the LYRIQ and the Buick in China. So we all along have been looking at all three form factors. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. And I just have a follow-up for Paul on the pricing. You mentioned higher incentives, but offset by the increase in step-up in the MSRPs. I just want to make sure we\u2019re interpreting that correctly that those are kind of a wash that you think one more or less compensates for the other to leave the pricing element more or less stable from 202s2 to 2023. Is that -- is that the correct way to think about it broadly? I know it\u2019s a volatile environment, but just want to as a starting point, is that the message, a wash? Paul Jacobson : Yes. I would say order of magnitude, yes. The pricing increases, we\u2019re not contemplating big ones this year, rather the annualization of what we did last year across the board. We have some new launches that would kind of come in. We won\u2019t get specific on that. But we are assuming that there\u2019s going to be some steady increased normalization of incentives. That\u2019s where we said we\u2019re trying to plan conservatively. What I\u2019ll tell you is, January month has come in really, really strong, a continuation of what we saw in December and we\u2019re just watching the environment around us, but we still feel good about where demand sits. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Paul. Thanks Mary. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Adam. Mary Barra : Thanks. Operator : And our next caller is Chris McNally with Evercore. Christopher McNally : Thanks so much. I just want to revisit Ryan\u2019s question on the IRA $300 million, and thanks so much for giving that number. Just our math is that, that would be something like 10 to 12 gigawatts from the two facilities in Ohio and Tennessee and without sort of confirming the explicit math, can we just talk about maybe how long it may take to ramp Ohio? And then obviously, Tennessee is only starting at the end of this year, but I think they\u2019re about 40 gigawatts each. So it seems like there is a material amount to grow at that capacity growth, but just anything you could talk about the time line on Ohio and Tennessee Giga? Mary Barra : Yes. So the plan was we started in fourth quarter, and we said a couple of earnings calls ago that Ohio would add 20% more capacity every quarter, so it would be fully up and running by the end of the year. That plan is still on track. I think you\u2019ll see us follow with similar, but maybe a little faster in Spring Hill because we already have all the experience. And we actually have people from Spring Hill at the Ohio facility right now to make sure we have a smooth start-up there. So -- and we\u2019ve talked about the plan is roughly around 37, 40. So I think you\u2019re in the right ballpark, but that\u2019s how those plans will ramp up. Christopher McNally : Perfect. That\u2019s super helpful. And just the follow-on, just from a modeling perspective, should we assume the 300 flows through EBIT or is there any benefit that also is going to start to benefit taxes as well? Just it is more we\u2019re going to see the benefit of IRA if it\u2019s only in EBIT or if there is actually some tax component as well? Paul Jacobson : We think that there will be some that kind of flows through both. Our deck has a guide on a lower tax rate of 16% to 18% for 2023. That\u2019s largely driven by R&D credits and some IRA. We\u2019re not getting any specifics into the breakout between them until we see the regs written, and we get more definition around it, but we do expect that there are likely going to be components in both areas. Christopher McNally : Okay, thanks so much Paul. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you so much. Two fairly quick ones, first one is back on pricing. I think you said you\u2019re trying to be conservative in your assumptions. So I was just hoping you could be a little bit more specific or explicit around what sort of incentive environment you\u2019re assuming, because I understand the MSRP going up, just not super clear from the outside, what sort of macro and/or industry environment you\u2019re assuming and the impact on the overall industry incentives? Paul Jacobson : Yes, hey Emmanuel, so nothing specific to guide on in terms of our forward incentives beyond. We do expect over time for incentives to increase from the sort of record low levels that we\u2019ve seen. We\u2019ve seen slight upticks, but I would say that\u2019s largely more of a function of interest rates than it is waning demand or inventories. Inventories still remain very tight. We expect that to be the case, especially grounded inventory at dealers through 2023. So while we see some normalizing of incentives, nothing more specific than that, that we\u2019ll guide to. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. So then just affirming in terms of macro environment, if that\u2019s okay. Are you assuming some sort of recession in the second half impact on sort of like consumer demand for vehicles or are you assuming sort of current conditions continue? And then I just have a follow-up on free cash flow. Mary Barra : Yes. So again, this is a situation we\u2019re watching carefully. But what we see from a new vehicle consumer is a consumer, as Paul said, even in the month of January we\u2019ve seen it to be very strong. So we\u2019re going to continue to monitor that and take the necessary steps. But we\u2019re going to watch and learn as we go through the year. We told you at Investor Day, we were going to be conservative as we plan this year, but also position ourselves to take advantage of whatever the market ends up being, and we\u2019re still on that plan executing. But again, from an early read in January, it\u2019s pretty positive. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just quickly on free cash flow. Can you just provide a high-level walk between the 2022 strong performance in 2023? Because obviously, the two sort of elements you would exclude to make them comparable the pension income, this is noncash, right? So yes, walk between 2022 and 2023 would be helpful. Paul Jacobson : Yes, just really high level, $10.5 billion in 2022. At the midpoint, we\u2019ve got a couple of billion dollars more of CapEx going forward and probably not as much of a working capital build as we saw in 2022. That\u2019s high level how you get to the 5 to 7. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Thank you so much. Mary Barra : Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Absolutely. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Barra : Great. Well, thank you, Michelle, and thanks to everyone for your questions. We, at General Motors, are really excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2023, especially with all the new vehicles that we\u2019re launching. Chevrolet and GMC will build on their leadership in pickup trucks and Chevrolet is giving customers around the world compelling entry-level products too. And this is the breakout year for the Ultium platform. So when you look at the products we\u2019ll have by the end of this year, again, they\u2019re all outstanding. Again, we expect another year of strong financial results and our confidence reflects the determination of the GMT -- of the GM Team, the strength of our vehicles we\u2019re delivering and the valuable relationships we\u2019ve developed with our dealers, our suppliers and our other partners. So I hope you see with what we did in 2022 and what we\u2019re indicating we\u2019re going to be able to achieve in 2023 that we continue to have your confidence, and we look forward to continuing to tell you more about this year as we go forward. So I hope everyone has a great rest of the day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to General Motors Company First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, April 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Ashish Kohli : Thanks, Julie, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I'd like to direct your attention to the forward-looking statements on the first page of our presentation. The content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Paul, Kyle, Dan and I are glad to have this opportunity to discuss our first quarter results with you. Once again, we delivered strong earnings, and I appreciate the efforts of everyone involved, including the GM team, our dealers, our suppliers, our unions, that all helped us meet strong customer demand for our products. Highlights include our international markets outside of China, which had a record quarter, and North America, where we earned 10.9% EBIT-adjusted margins. In the U.S., we are the market leader in retail and fleet sales, including commercial sales. We earned the largest year-over-year increase in U.S. market share of any automaker, and we did it with strong production and inventory discipline as well as consistent pricing. We delivered more than 20,000 EVs in the U.S. in the quarter, on the strength of record Bolt EV and EUV sales and rising Cadillac LYRIQ deliveries. This moves us up to the second market position and increased our EV market share by 800 basis points. We also continue to sell more trucks in the U.S. than anyone by a wide margin. In addition, the $2 billion of fixed cost reductions we are targeting will flow to the bottom line faster than we originally expected. And the enterprise value of these fixed cost reductions will have even greater than $2 billion of value because we're strengthening our culture, which has consistently delivered strong results; we're reducing our executive ranks by more than 15% through voluntary separations, which will help reduce bureaucracy; and we are empowering our leaders to structure their teams to be faster and more agile. In addition, we are prioritizing programs and projects that have the highest revenue and cost impact. We understand the bar continues to be raised, so we're holding ourselves accountable to drive improvements every single day. As we look at the performance of the business and the opportunity ahead of us with new ICE and EV launches, we're able to raise our full year 2023 earnings guidance to a range of $11 billion to $13 billion. The new ICE products we are launching around the world will build on this momentum and support strong mix, pricing and EBIT. In GMI, the new Chevrolet Trax, is off to a very fast start in Korea with more than 13,000 orders placed in the first week of sale. In Brazil, the new Chevrolet Montana pickup saw more than 10,000 orders out of the gate. And demand for our new midsize and heavy-duty pickups in North America is growing, especially at the high end. Over the last years, we've evolved our premium truck offerings from a niche to a franchise. And we did it through manufacturing investments, design, demonstrated capability and technologies like Super Cruise. Our customers are responding. 60% of dealer and customer orders for the new Chevrolet Colorado, our high-end Z71, ZR2 and Trail Boss models. Last year, it was 42%. 75% of the GMC Canyon orders are for higher-end AT4 and Denali models. Last year, it was 45%. 52% of Chevrolet Silverado HD orders are for the top-of-the-line high-country model. And 30% of the GMC Sierra heavy-duty orders are for the new Denali Ultimate, which is a brand-new model that didn't exist a year ago. Our profitable growth opportunities extend into other segments as well. For example, the Chevrolet Trax and Trailblazer and the Buick Encore GX and Envista will help us win new customers from brands that walked away from affordable vehicles or scaled-back customer choice. All 4 of these small SUVs are beautifully designed, packed with technology and include a long list of standard active safety and driver assistance technologies, yet they all have starting MSRPs below $30,000, with the Trax starting below $25,000. As a measure of just how good these vehicles are, the Trax earned a 63% lease residual. That's 24 points above the previous generation and the best we've ever done in this segment. As for the Envista, one auto writer said its gorgeous styling resembles the Lamborghini and another said, as far as rivals go, the 2024 Envista might be playing in the sandbox alone, because it's both premium and affordable. At the same time, our EV volumes and market share are growing as cell production rises and our teams master new hardware, software and manufacturing technologies that we are deploying. As Paul and I have shared, we plan to produce 400,000 EVs over the course of '22, '23 and the first half of 2024, including 50,000 EVs in North America in the first half of this year and double that in the second half. So far this year, we've built more than 2,000 Cadillac LYRIQs, and production will continue to rise to help us meet pent-up demand. Both GMC HUMMER EV models are shipping from factory zero, and production is scaling. Our production ramp is carefully cadenced as we add additional trim series to the HUMMER EV pickup and began production of EDITION 1 SUV. The team at CAMI has now built more than 500 BrightDrop Zevo 600 vans, and the Zevo 400 begins production in the second half of the year, and we've added Purolator and Ryder as customers. We already have 340 fleet customers for the Silverado EV, and the team at Ramos Arizpe is making great progress preparing for the launches of the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV in the second half of the year. All of this is enabled by rising production at Ultium cells in Ohio, which we expect to reach full capacity at the end of the year. Everything we learned in Ohio will be applied to our next-use Ultium cell plants, including in Tennessee, where we will begin hiring and training production workers in a matter of weeks. Work also continues to transform our assembly plant in Orient Township, Michigan to build the GMC Sierra EV and the Chevrolet Silverado EV. We have progressed so far, that it's now time to plan to end the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV production, which will happen at the very end of the year. When Orient EV assembly reopens in 2024 and reaches full production, employment will nearly triple, and we'll have a company-wide capacity to build 600,000 electric trucks annually. We'll need this capacity because our trucks more than measure up to our customers' expectation, and we'll demonstrate that work and EV range are not mutually exclusive terms for Chevrolet and GMC trucks. So stay tuned. As we scale EVs, we will lower fixed costs and will continue to drive margin improvements we outlined at Investor Day. This includes optimizing our pouch cells for energy density, range and cost using new approaches pioneered at our Wallace Battery Center and by our technology partners. And we announced this morning that we're also working with Samsung SDI to add cylindrical and prismatic cells to our portfolio. Having multiple strong cell partners will allow us to expand into new segments more quickly, grow our annual EV assembly capacity in North America significantly above 1 million units and integrate cells directly into battery packs to reduce weight, complexity and cost. Reducing vehicle complexity and expanding the use of shared subsystems between ICE and EV programs is another priority. For example, we are reducing the overall complexity of our software configurations and related hardware on all future ICE and EV products. One important part of our efforts includes the reduction of infotainment screen configurations by 60% across our entire portfolio. By reducing complexity, we can focus on delivering new and improved digital experiences much more quickly. We also expect that our supply chain will be an even bigger competitive advantage starting in '26 and '27, because of the direct investments we've made in lithium, nickel and other commodities as well as CAM, which will allow us to purchase significant quantities of material on favorable commercial terms. All of this is coming together in a way that will fundamentally change the narrative that traditional automakers can't deliver competitive EV margins. We have a lot of work to do, but we have the right trajectory, and I believe we can get there much faster than people think. Now before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to invite Kyle to share an update on Cruise, which continues to expand the scale and scope of its operations. Kyle, over to you. Kyle Vogt : Thanks, Mary. I'd like to give a brief update on our progress. Since last quarter, our driverless fleet has increased by 86% from 130 to 242 concurrently operating AVs. We've completed over 1.5 million driverless miles, and the pace continues to accelerate. Our first million miles took us about 15 months to complete, while the next million miles will likely take less than 3. We're also regularly completing over 1,000 driverless trips with passengers every day, and we're seeing strong retention from our early users. This is significant quarter-over-quarter growth in our services well liked, but we've had limits on when and where it operates. But today, I'm excited to share that right now, a small portion of our fleet is now serving driverless rides 24 hours a day across all of San Francisco. For us, this is a milestone years in the making and represents that our driverless fleet has real commercial value. We're completing the work needed to roll it out to the rest of our driverless fleet as soon as we can. Another key part of rapid scaling is a readily available supply of vehicles. Fortunately, our purpose-built and cost-optimized AV, the Cruise Origin, will be testing in Austin soon. This vehicle has been validated almost entirely in simulation, reducing our historical reliance on expensive and time-consuming supervised test-mile collection. The launch of the Origin is a critical step on our path to profitability as well and towards hitting $1 billion in revenue in 2025. We remain on track and slightly ahead as of today. Thanks, Mary. Back to you. Mary Barra : Well, thanks, Kyle. And now I'm going to turn it over to Paul for a deeper dive into the quarter. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and thank you, Kyle, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report a strong start to the year as the team continues to execute on our transformation. We're strategically transitioning the business, while at the same time, leveraging our important ICE portfolio with new and refreshed products, driving continued robust demand for our vehicles while pricing has remained stable. We're also excited to bring on incremental EV volumes, particularly in the second half of the year, as we increase battery cell production at Ultium cells. And as Mary mentioned, we took initial steps in Q1 towards implementing our $2 billion cost initiative, of which we now expect to realize about 50% in 2023, with the majority of this benefit occurring in the back half of the year. The performance-based exits in roughly 5,000 individuals, who participated in the voluntary severance program, will drive approximately $1 billion towards this target. But people cost is just one of several areas we're focusing on. The remaining $1 billion will come from the following initiatives : actions to reduce complexity across the portfolio and throughout the business, in everything we do from vehicle design to engineering and manufacturing. Prioritizing our growth initiatives. We simply cannot do everything. We're focusing on projects like Cruise, BrightDrop and software-defined vehicles, which offer the biggest returns on revenue and margin. And lastly, we're being tactical on overhead and discretionary costs, including corporate travel, IT costs and marketing spend. These actions will have a near-term impact on costs, but we also outlined a number of additional medium- to long-term opportunities at our Investor Day in November last year, which we are aggressively pursuing. For example, we are developing a fully integrated battery ecosystem and taking a portfolio approach to battery raw materials. We will source from a mix of established and early-stage miners, giving us both security of supply and lower pricing volatility. These are meaningful advantages as we scale into the back half of the decade. The Treasury Department's recent guidance on the clean energy consumer purchase incentive also validated our battery supply chain work with our entire fleet of EVs under the MSRP cap qualifying for the full $7,500 incentive this year. Now let's discuss another important topic, dealer inventory. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, our plan is to balance supply with demand, and that's exactly what we did this quarter. Early in the year, production improved as supply constraints started to ease and began to outpace still healthy and growing demand. As a result, we proactively planned some downtime, which allowed us to end the quarter with U.S. dealer stock flat compared to December, while we gained 1.3 points of share and increased volumes 4% year-over-year. These production actions were contemplated in our 2023 guidance metrics laid out at the beginning of the year. We are still planning to a 15 million unit SAR and targeting to end 2023 with 50 to 60 days of total dealer inventory. Although seasonality, production schedules, and timing of fleet deliveries may take us out of this range from time to time. Now let's get into the Q1 results. Revenue was $40 billion, up 11% year-over-year. We achieved $3.8 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 9.5% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.21 in EPS diluted adjusted. Total company results were down only $200 million year-over-year, despite a combined $800 million headwind from lower pension income and lower GM financial earnings, providing more evidence that the underlying business remains quite strong. Adjusted auto free cash flow was essentially flat year-over-year, driven by higher capital expenditures related to our EV investments, seasonal working capital headwinds and GM Financial dividend timing. However, we used our strong balance sheet to repurchase $365 million of stock in Q1, retiring 9 million shares and early retiring $1.5 billion in debt maturing later this year. Given the strong Q1 results and our current outlook, we are increasing our full year guidance to EBIT-adjusted in the $11 billion to $13 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $6.35 to $7.35 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $5.5 billion to $7.5 billion range. I'll provide more details on this after I cover the regional results. North America delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted of $3.6 billion, up $400 million year-over-year, and EBIT-adjusted margins of 10.9%. Results were primarily driven by higher pricing and volume, partially offset by mix, lower pension income, warranty reserve adjustments and higher commodity and logistics costs. We saw a $1.3 billion pricing tailwind year-over-year in the quarter, driven largely by the price increases in 2022 carrying into 2023. We expect this year-over-year pricing benefit to moderate as we progress through the year. However, we anticipate pricing performance on our all-new midsize pickups and refreshed HD pickups to partially offset this headwind. Demand for our full-size pickups remain strong, with increased year-over-year total sales of our Silverado and Sierra full-size pickups up 3%. We also gained 0.3 percentage points of total market share to continue our #1 position in full-size pickup sales. Encouragingly, April-to-date performance is also trending well as demand remains healthy, inventory levels are essentially flat, pricing has been consistent, and we're seeing a steady increase in industry volume. GM International delivered Q1 EBIT-adjusted of $350 million, largely flat year-over-year, despite the fact that equity income in China was down $150 million due to lower volume and pricing pressure, partially offset by cost actions. The environment in China has been very challenging as the industry navigates continued COVID-related impacts, regulatory changes for both EV and ICE vehicles and greater-than-expected competitive pricing actions. The China team is taking aggressive actions to offset. However, we don't expect an improvement in equity income until the second half of the year. EBIT-adjusted in GM International, excluding China equity income, was $250 million, up over $150 million versus last year. The successful turnaround the team has executed over the past few years continued with another record quarter. The results were driven by higher pricing, volume and mix, partially offset by commodity and logistics costs and foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, we expect pricing to be up on a year-over-year basis, leveraging the strength of the portfolio and more than covering FX headwinds. For GM International, we anticipate moderately improved full year 2023 results relative to '22. The strong results and momentum for the rest of GM International are anticipated to more than offset continued headwinds in China. GM Financial delivered first quarter EBT adjusted of over $750 million, down $500 million year-over-year, as expected, primarily due to the expected decrease in net leased vehicle income, driven by lower lease sales mix as a result of reduced new vehicle production since Q3 2021 and lower net gains on lease terminations. Also, while higher cost of funds impacted results versus 2022, it was partially offset by higher effective yields on new originations and growth in the loan portfolio. GM Financial's key metrics, balance sheet and liquidity remained strong, providing them the ability to support the GM enterprise across economic cycles. We've seen no material impact due to the recent banking crisis. In fact, earlier this month, we were able to renew our $16 billion revolving credit facilities while also receiving a ratings upgrade of GM and GM Financial bonds from Moody's. This upgrade should improve credit spreads on future bond issuances and improve cost of funds as their debt portfolio reprices. GM Financial also paid a $450 million dividend to GM in Q1. Our full year GM Financial expectations of EBT adjusted in the mid-$2 billion range and dividends similar to 2022 have not changed. Corporate expenses were $300 million in the quarter, down slightly year-over-year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives. Cruise expenses were $550 million in the quarter, up $250 million year-over-year, driven by an increase in operating spend as well as by the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense this quarter versus Q1 2022. As we look forward to the rest of the year, our goal is to remain agile and adapt to the dynamic macro environment. Our updated guidance assumes that the pricing benefit we saw in Q1 is neutralized over the rest of the year as we cycle price increases taken in 2022 and incentives gradually increase. Commodity and logistics costs have been stickier than originally estimated, primarily due to higher steel prices on market index contracts. For the full year, we now expect commodity and logistic costs to be essentially flat year-over-year versus our prior expectation for a modest tailwind. Our expectation to realize at least $300 million EBIT-adjusted benefit in 2023 from the clean energy production tax credits is unchanged. And while we continue to experience parts availability and logistics challenges as we did in Q1, we expect these issues to gradually improve over the next few quarters and are, therefore, still expecting 2023 year-over-year wholesale volume to increase 5% to 10%. As Mary mentioned, we are making great progress towards our goal of 1 million units of North America EV capacity in 2025. As we scale and launch multiple high-volume EVs in strategically important segments, we will see the benefits of the Ultium platform expand and help us deliver margins in the low to mid-single digits by 2025. In closing, I also want to say how proud and thankful I am for all of our amazing team members for their tireless efforts. They've executed quarter after quarter and delivered 2 consecutive years of record profits despite many external challenges. Needless to say, my optimism for GM's long-term potential remains very high. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to -- Paul, you mentioned that the first quarter pricing would reverse through the course of the year, and that's something close to neutral. But it seems like there are some lessons that have been learned for the last couple of years on creating mix and price upside and managing the business to be more profitable over time. So I'm just curious if you can talk about maybe the lessons that were learned, the products that are being launched. Because I mean, it seemed like the mid-pickups and the HD refresh, you're leaning into higher mix. But then Mary, you mentioned 4 crossovers below $30,000, that's kind of going in the other direction. I mean, how do you think about managing this going forward? And do you think this current price level is something that you might be able to maintain even though you give back what you gained in the first quarter in the face of what sort of an increasing threat from 1 large player, Tesla, that is cutting price aggressively in the market. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks for kicking us off today. I think there's a lot to unpack in your question. I'll just start by saying we need to be very conscious of the macro environment around us. And as we said, going into the year, we were planning I think somewhat conservatively in recognition of that macro. So about a 15 million units SAR with some normalization of incentives and pricing to a little bit lower demand. We certainly hadn't seen that in Q1. And despite that forecast, we're still comfortable taking up our guidance, because I think we've reflected some of that in the back half. And certainly, if we see demand hold up, I would expect that we can outperform these results across the board. But we want to make sure that we're very conscious of the macro. When you ask about lessons learned, I think we certainly have really focused on vehicle margins. And I think one of the important steps this quarter, that I'm not sure that the market digested all that well, was when we took down capacity for a couple of weeks at a plant to balance production to demand. And I think when you look back on that decision to have inventories flat while we gained share and increased volumes over the time period, I think, is one of those really valuable lessons learned that we can take to the future going forward. So on the trim side, clearly, what we are seeing is strong demand for the higher-end trims. Mary mentioned in her remarks, the demand for the Denali Ultimate. This is a trim level that didn't even exist a year ago, yet customers were asking for it, and you see they've responded with their orders. So I think there's lots to look at lots of encouraging signs for how we think about the business going forward. Mary Barra : Yes. I would just add, John, that we also -- you have to have the right portfolio for the market. We're doing really well at the very high end, especially in trucks that Paul mentioned. But having the Trax and the Envista, the Buick Envista at affordable levels, and we've been able to do that profitably because of the work we've done to reduce complexity leverage the scale of components across the vehicles. For instance, the Trax only has 1 powertrain. So I think when you talk about mix, I think the opportunity, you still have to cover the market for what people can afford but doing it in a way that you've really reduced complexity, I think, is one of the big lessons learned, and we're going to continue to drive that not only across the ICE portfolio, but the EV portfolio as well. John Murphy : And maybe if I could just ask one follow-up. The CAPU of 96% in North America that was outlined in the financial data, it was based on a 2-shift straight time. That's given where absolute lines are. That's actually much higher than I would have thought. Taking that higher is going to require adding extra shifts. I mean, how do you do that? And how do you sort of balance sort of this maybe step up in volume that you might execute on later this year? Do you add third shifts? I mean, you just -- you get into this thing where you're seeing like drop -- you're managing the business very optimally right now. And if you start growing volume, I think you're going to become a lot less optimal as you start adding third shifts, particularly with that 96% CAPU number? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So John, it obviously varies by vehicle type and where we are, and we've been running pretty much as flat out as we can on full-size SUVs and pickup trucks over time. So there's a little bit of the margins, but that's something that we've got to really manage aggressively across the board. So there are opportunities to be able to do that. Should we see demand pick up. But balancing it to demand, I think, is the most important piece of that as we can. So if we need to take down to moderate some of the growth, I think you'll see us do that. Opportunities to make up for it are really centered around making sure that we've got those shift capacities as well as the parts and components and logistics to be able to move the inventory when it's finished, too. John Murphy : But fair to say that's all variable cost that comes in? Paul Jacobson : Absolutely. Operator : Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Congrats. just 2 questions for me. First, maybe, Paul, I was hoping you could maybe talk a bit about the -- how we should think about the cadence for North America earnings for the rest of the year, particularly with the strong start you mentioned in April, an in terms of the production and any product ramp that you'll have for the trucks? And then secondly, maybe for Mary and Kyle, congrats on the 1.5 million driverless miles. Hope you can share a bit of, a, where you're seeing safety metrics on those miles and performance metrics relative to expectations? And how the experience is informing you on future scaling plans for Cruise? Paul Jacobson : Yes, thanks for the question. So on the cadence side, I think we alluded to on the full year guidance. The original guidance was that we thought the second half was going to be more challenging. So as we lap the price increases of last year as well as building in a little bit of time, if there are any downturns in demand, that's where we kind of see it. So I would say it's a little bit of a first half, second half story. We still got time to be able to manage the second half. We're watching it closely. As we said in the prepared remarks, April has been very strong for us as well and has continued to be strong. So I would say that the risk still lies a little bit in the second half, but it's one that even with that out there, we felt comfortable raising our guidance today. Mary Barra : And Kyle, do you want to take the question on Cruise scaling? Kyle Vogt : Sure. Yes, I can do that. So we are in this rapid scaling phase right now. And on the safety side, our performance is strong. We're very happy with how that's going. We'll have some more to share on that soon. But for scaling, we've almost doubled our fleet size just in the last quarter, and we expect that kind of rate of improvement to continue. And as we do that, it surfaces just one bottleneck after another that we continuously burn down and move out of the way so we can keep scaling up the fleet. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : It's great to hear the comments about changing the EV margin narrative. I'm hoping you can maybe just broadly address the developments that we're seeing in North America and China in the EV market. It does look like competition is pretty aggressive in both areas. So I was wondering if anything that you're seeing is surprising to you? And are there strategic adjustments that you are making as you kind of observe the market dynamics in both markets, North America and China? Maybe you could just provide a little color on how you adjust strategy in real time. Mary Barra : So let me -- Rod, appreciate the question. Let me start with China. As Paul said, the industry is pretty tough right now. It's still recovering from COVID. Pricing is very aggressive, as you know. And when you look at the fundamentals of the industry in China, you got 50% capacity utilization. You've got more than 100 brands competing. I don't think that's a steady state that you can look at. But if you look a little longer term from a country perspective, I mean, there's still tremendous growth, and I think the market can still be strong and have great profitability potential. So from a GM-specific perspective, we're launching the right EVs right now off the Ultium platform. I think '24 and '25 are going to be key years for us as we not only get the right EV products in market that we think will compete at the right price that allows us to be profitable, but then we're also aggressively pursuing improvements from a structural cost perspective across our China operations. So I think China is in a period right now because of where the industry is and the number of competitors with the pricing challenges that will sort, and I think we'll be well positioned. We do have brands that have value in the country, and we're going to have the right EV portfolio there. And frankly, right now, our ICE portfolio is strong. And so that's going to enable us to fund it as we look at the price challenges. From a U.S. perspective, our main focus right now is twofold. One is getting the EVs out there. We're launching the battery plants, the module, the assembly and then the vehicle, also at the same time, from a Cadillac LYRIQ perspective, we're launching -- it's really the first vehicle with Altify. So there's a lot of new. That's why we have a very measured cadence as we're ramping, where now, the battery cell plant is flowing very well, and that is enabling us now to really focus on module and pack, which we're doing. That's why we said even at the beginning of the year that the second half is when you're really going to see the curve start to accelerate, and we're on track to do that. So we're really focused on getting the vehicles out there, because we think we price them right to begin with. When you look at where the LYRIQ is below, it starts below $60,000 or right at $60,000; the Equinox at around $30,000; the Blazer in the mid-40s. These are price points that I think are very important. And then when you look at the vehicles from a styling technology perspective, I think they're going to be great. While we're working to really get these vehicles out there because the customer response is so strong, we're also working on costs. And so the $2 billion structural cost reduction that we're working is, as Paul indicated, we're doing well on that, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities. But then we're also looking at how do we continue to drive improvements from both an ICE and the EV margin perspective. And there's a tremendous amount of work going on there. So get the vehicles out, continue to work on pricing around costs, so you can have the right price. It's really the focus that we have right now, and this is going to be a critical year for that. But as Paul and I both said, we believe, even with not only the challenges of commodities, but also the pricing pressures, we still think we are well positioned to achieve the low mid-single -- low- to mid-single-digit margins in 2025. Rod Lache : Great. And just kind of keying off of the comment on costs, can you talk a little bit about the components of that $1 billion cost increase that we saw in North America? And obviously, over time, just given the amount of spending on growth initiatives, your structural costs are going to go up, certainly through mid-decade. Can you just provide some thoughts on how we should be thinking about the trajectory of that and the extent to which that changes breakeven points in the business? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks, Rod. So a couple of things. On costs in North America, obviously, we had the lower pension income, a little bit higher commodities and logistics costs, in particular. We also saw a bit of an uptick in warranty costs. I think that's probably a bit of an anomaly and won't repeat throughout the year across the board. So we're still getting, like I said, early traction on the $2 billion controllable fixed cost reduction, as we talked about, the biggest placeholder on that being the voluntary program. So the $1 billion of savings will begin to accrue savings really probably late second quarter and then really start to get into bulk in the second half of the year. So that was a really good way to kick start that program, and we're grateful to the employees who chose to take that package. The other side is a lot of grinding around on overhead as we talked about going forward, a lot of discretionary spend. So we've got teams that are focused on getting savings in discretionary spend, IT-related costs, marketing-related costs across the board. And we think that we can get traction on those things pretty quickly as well. So that's where we feel confident getting to about 50% this year, with the remainder accruing into 2024. Now this is important, I think, not just for offsetting some of the near-term pressures, but some more of those competitive dynamics that we've talked about for the long term in an effort to continue to improve the margin trajectory of the company. Rod Lache : Just any color, Paul, on the kind of intermediate term outlook for structural costs? Is that something that you think can be sort of held at this level with the amount of capital that you're spending and the growth initiatives, who would think that there'd be some uplift to that. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Well, we're seeing obviously some pressure in D&A, but that's where -- if you recall, we talked about the $2 billion program offsetting that and resulting in savings. So that's what we're aiming for. That's going to be a little bit of a hurdle to get over, but one that we feel comfortable that we can do. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Dan Levy : First, I wanted to ask about the share buybacks. Interesting to see that you did share buybacks in the quarter. And I'm guessing that speaks to your -- the confidence in your liquidity profile. But as you need to ramp on growth spend and as -- there's an open question on type of cycle normalization that we're going into, how are you going to approach share buybacks? Mary Barra : Well, I think what you saw in the first quarter, when you look -- and our cash generation is cyclical as we move through the year, but we're following our capital allocation framework at, first, reinvesting in the business. And we think we've optimized that to have the right products, both from an ICE and an EV perspective as we make this transformation, along with the focus that we have on some growth businesses like BrightDrop and Cruise that are -- we really think are going to lead to tremendous growth and margin expansion as well. But with that, we saw our way to do the share buyback. We're going to continue to evaluate that quarter-by-quarter as we go through the year. But I think we felt confident doing that. We felt confident in raising guidance. And we feel confident overall in our cash position to be able to continue to look for those opportunities. Dan Levy : Great. And then the second question, I know you've laid out the 2025 low- to mid-single-digit EV margin target. One of your competitors obviously has put out -- they've laid out more clearly where they are in EVs today. I don't know if you're in a position to disclose more thoroughly where you are in terms of the contribution margin standpoint or on an absolute EBIT standpoint. If so, that would be great. But beyond that, in light of the current environment, I think this touches on Rod's question. You have this 400,000 EV target. But given the ongoing cost dynamics, are you going to be nimble with that target or balancing profit dynamics with volume? Or is that purely going to be a function of the supply, and you're going to be very firm on that 400,000 target? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Dan, I'll start with that. Mary can jump in. I think in the early stages, we're going to be very firm with those targets across the board. Because when you look at the EV profitability, and we're not going to give a lot of details right now just because the numbers aren't that meaningful, when you look at the infrastructure investment that we've made already starting to depreciate that, not fully utilizing as we ramp up, et cetera, that will start to become more clear. So we need to be able to ramp up the capacity to realize the scale benefits and get to the pricing efficiency or the cost efficiency that we're targeting to be able to drive those margins going forward. So I think it's one that we've got to make sure that we look to where the demand is. But as we look at the order books and the indications of interest for the vehicles that we've announced and the ones that we've taken orders for, we feel very confident about the demand there for the 400,000 and ramping up to the 1 million, and we'll continue to balance that. But structurally, we obviously have a lot of work to do on costs. We've talked about that. We've got a lot of work to do on scaling, and all of that is coming together and, as you can see, picking up speed pretty quickly as we get into the middle and back part of this year. Mary Barra : Paul, you said it well. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : I just want to follow up on Dan and Rod's question and maybe in a different way, I apologize. But again, you expect to earn low- to mid-single-digit EBIT-adjusted margins in the EV portfolio kind of from 2025, before the impacts of clean energy credits. On my numbers at least, that's going to be -- it could be higher than Tesla's margins. But putting that aside, if you are confronted with a choice of doing the 1 million or doing the mid-single-digit margin, if it had to be a choice and you couldn't do both, my interpretation of what you just said is that you'll prioritize volume. Is that the message here in the case that the economics did require you to make a choice on trade-off? Mary Barra : Yes. Adam, I mean, I think we're going to work toward profitable growth. I'm not going to say, as we're sitting in 2025, second, third or fourth quarter, that we're going to do this or that, depending on the situation. When you look at the portfolio that we'll have, and I believe it's the right portfolio, we're not duplicating our ICE portfolio. We are very targeted in having the right vehicles from different price points. Because to get to a point where there's that many EVs being sold in the U.S., recognizing competition as well, you have to meet the customer where they're at from an affordability perspective. And I know you've written about that in some of your notes. So we're going to look and be smart, maintain the brand value, the vehicle value, the residual value. But we think with the portfolio, we're going to be well positioned to achieve the 1 million units with the right profit margins. So -- but we're going to be nimble. So just to put an either/or out there, we're going to make -- I'd say, make our own luck as we do this with the right products and continued cost reduction. I hope it... Adam Jonas : And I just had a follow-up for Kyle. A lot of tech companies are undergoing cost saving or restructuring kind of actions to give themselves a bit of a lower breakeven point, maybe some more runway given the changing capital markets environment. Now you obviously you have the luxury of having GM as a partner on a lot of levels. That's a huge advantage. But I'm just wondering if you also would have identified some actions that could be taken to maybe reduce that burn rate going forward in a new environment. Kyle Vogt : Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean, as we march towards profitability, which is a big focus for us, we've been looking for a lot of ways to do more with less and run really efficiently. And so similar to what Paul mentioned across the board in terms of some of the structuring and streamlining inside of GM, we're doing those types of activities in Cruise as well and seeing some good results there. But really for us, the focus is on rapid scaling and therefore, getting incrementally closer to profitability. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Daniel Ives : So what would you say has been the biggest surprise this quarter on the positive? Something where either from a production perspective, cost or even efficiency from development and specific on the EV side, especially given the transformation that's happening? Mary Barra : Great question. And I would say it's multiple that I've been extremely pleased with the organization on how we keep finding ways to drive efficiency. When I talked about the fact that our screen configurations were reducing by 60%, so really dialing in on how do we reduce complexity on EVs, by the way, it benefits ICE as well. To be able to have the right models with the right features and then the ability to really start taking advantage of the software platform, that's what's really being rolled out now that we have Ultium and Altify. And so that is something that I'm really proud of the team of what they're doing. And then just overall, I knew we had a strong product set, but the strong customer and dealer reaction that we're seeing to the products that we put out from an EV perspective, I think that also gives me a lot of confidence in the strength of execution. And then finally, even as we're in a year of rapid launches, I think we haven't had this many launches I think for more than a decade. The team still very aggressively is working to take cost out, as signified of what we've been able to do with taking 15% of the leadership structure out, which is -- and the way that the teams are looking to optimize, reduce complexity, become more agile. So it's not only -- I feel we have the right products and we're really reducing complexity. I think we have the right culture that is really driving a continuous improvement mindset from a cost perspective. So Dan, those are the 2 things I'm most proud of. Operator : Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : My first question, Paul, I was hoping you could put maybe a little bit of a finer point in terms of what are the puts and takes you're assuming for the balance of the year in terms of, I guess, revenue and cost. I mean it seems, based on your previous comments, maybe an assumption of some moderation in pricing in North America. But then I think your costs should be going down as a result of some of the headcount reduction. Is that directionally the right way? Are there any other important pieces? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Emmanuel, I would say we expect pricing. So North America pricing was about a $1.3 billion benefit in the quarter. As we lap last year's pricing increases, we expect or we're planning for -- I wouldn't say we expect at this point, but we're planning and assuming that we end up giving some of that back so that we're essentially net flat for the year on that, whether that's through incentives or through pricing changes, et cetera. So a little bit of a giveback for the rest of the year. And like I said to the earlier question, that's -- most of that's sort of backloaded. But if we see demand continuing to be strong, then I would say that we'll probably outperform that assumption going forward. On the cost side, a little bit kind of moderation from where we were before. We thought commodities and logistics would be down year-over-year. We're now seeing that essentially be flat. Like I said, we've seen some pressure in steel and some other things in logistics across the board. So overall, production up 5% to 10%, as we said; pricing relatively flat for the year, and that's how you can kind of center on where we're projecting at the midpoint. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. And then I guess as we're trying to figure out your progress towards some of the EV margin targets, and I understand you're not prepared to share some of the current economics. Are you able to tell us, I guess, what portion of the company's CapEx and engineering is currently spent on EV? And what would be the targets for that EV share of CapEx and engineering maybe by mid-decade? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So right now, we've said it's about 3/4 is on EV, when you look at capital and engineering expense, we still have some mid-cycle vehicles that we're doing on the ICE side. But largely, the engineering and the capital is going into the EV side. That will obviously, as we work through the transformation, go to 100% over the next few years. Operator : Our next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. James Picariello : Can you clarify how the structural cost savings range is now trending for this year relative to the $2 billion GM's targeting to be achieved by the end of next year. And then just how should we be thinking about the associated cash costs tied to this effort for this year? Paul Jacobson : So fair question. As we said, when we launched the program last quarter, 30% to 50%, we expected to get in the first year. We're now guiding to the high end of that range. So I think we'll come in about 50%. That ultimately is going to offset some of the pressures that we've seen. So we may not see a full $1 billion come off of structural costs. But certainly, we'll get the savings from where we were going forward. The biggest component of that is obviously the voluntary severance program. We disclosed about a $900 million cash charge associated with that. That will largely be spent this year. The rest of the things that we identified, whether it's travel, IT, marketing or some of the complexity, we don't expect will have significant cash costs associated with it. James Picariello : Got it. That's helpful. And then as we think about fleet mix and the general rule of thumb for the U.S. -- for the industry in the U.S., I think the fleet channels have been starved of, of product for almost 3 years. Is this potentially helping the profitability of your fleet mix of the industry's fleet mix for at least this year, just thinking about that dynamic? Paul Jacobson : Yes, it's a fair question. Obviously, we're seeing gains in fleet. And I think the historical view of fleet as a discount chain to drive volume isn't really there anymore. We're seeing really strong pricing on the fleet side. And we expect that business is going to continue to grow and be a contributor to our margins. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : And thanks too for the earlier comments on China. I do want to ask a bit more around your operations there, though, just because, on the one hand, it seems like less of a needle mover for total company profits than it used to be with North America more profitable than before and consolidated IO flipping from loss-making to profitable. But on the other hand, the equity income there was the lowest in some time, apart from a couple of quarters impacted by COVID closures. So can you talk about any onetime disruptions you might have incurred there in the quarter, such as paradoxically maybe around COVID reopenings as the virus spread or any other onetime factor? And then what is it that you need to do now to restore profitability to where you want it to be? You're strong at the low end of the EV market. I'm guessing that's probably a more well-rounded higher-end EV lineup that you see the most opportunity to close the gap. So along those lines, can you help us in terms of like what that comment in the shareholder letter around 400,000, I think, Ultium EVs produced over '22 and '23 with 50,000 in the first half in the U.S., doubling in the back half? What does that kind of squeeze to for your anticipated Ultium ramp in China? And then how are you thinking about the profitability impact to your operations in China once those EVs do launch, maybe in light of some of the recent EV pricing actions in that market? Mary Barra : So great question. And from a China perspective, I think COVID definitely had an impact, and COVID across the country very impacted from a Shanghai-specific perspective, that impacted our business. But I think what is really important for us right now on the low end, we need to build on the strength we've had with the Hong Guang Mini EV. And we're repositioning with SGMW, the Baojun brand to be the right -- have the right brand characteristics from an EV perspective. And so that's very important that we execute that in the Wuling -- SGM Wuling joint venture. In the SGM venture, it's getting the vehicles off of Ultium launched an in-country because we've seen good reception to them. We just did some launch in the last couple of weeks, and the market reaction was very good. So it's getting those vehicles scaled and getting them into the market. We think because they're new, we're going to -- brand new and well received, we're going to be able to achieve the pricing that we intended for those. And we're just kept remain dynamic. And that's why in addition to getting the Ultium EVs launched in China, we've also got to really continue aggressive measures on taking out structural costs, which we already will do have plans in place to execute on, and we'll report on those as we go forward. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. And then just lastly, with regard to the reiterated low to mid-single-digit EV margin target in 2025, which I think is encouraging in light of the recent pricing action, this target continues to exclude any benefit from the energy tax credit portion of the Inflation Reduction Act. When you introduce that target -- '25 target at the EV Investor Day last November, it excluded the benefits in part. Because I thought that the act wasn't yet law and there were uncertainties about whether the credit would be refundable against the -- applicable against the manufacturing cost or if it was only against the taxable income, and then possibly maybe you had yet to finalize negotiations with your JV battery partner, LG Energy Solution, how those credits would be shared. Now that we do have the details around the Act, and it's passed into law, do you have any updated thoughts on how much the low to mid-single digits margin could benefit from those credits? And then with regard to the new JV from Samsung, I mean, you entered into that JV knowing about the IRA. So did you already finalize how that would be shared relative to the credits going into the JV? And did that maybe enter into your thinking to start a JV with an additional partner? Paul Jacobson : So Ryan, I'll take a shot at that. I think when you look at the guidance that we gave around EVs back in November, yes, we drew sort of 2 lines around it, just to help show you where we're going. So the first was the low to mid-single digits without any tax credits. That's to make sure that you know that we're focused on the vehicle profitability. We've obviously are in this for the long term, and we've got to make sure that we're hitting goals for the long term, assuming that we get a normal world where maybe there aren't EV tax credits. So the vehicle program is one thing. The second piece of it, on the tax credits themselves. We did say that about $3,500 to $5,500 per vehicle is what our estimate is. We said about $300 million this year that we would expect to get out of that. We're not going to comment specifically on any deals, how that might be shared, et cetera, across the board. But again, we feel confident about the tax credits in the short term, helping us to narrow that gap between that low to mid-single-digit vehicle profitability on the vehicle and getting it to ICE parity faster than we originally thought. So those are the ways that we're thinking about how we go to it. But longer term, the vehicles have got to stand by themselves. Operator : Our last question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : GM seems to be leading in sort of securing the raw material supply. Curious what your thoughts are on the 2032 EPA targets that will require about 67% of vehicles to be EV by 2032. Do you think there's enough lithium to hit the targets? Do you think you could get enough lithium by then in the industry? And do you think we have enough capacity in place to get there, I guess, considering you've been pretty good about getting capacity so far. Mary Barra : I'll let Paul talk about -- specifically about lithium. But when we look at the '27 through '32 targets what EPA has put out, we're still digesting them, understanding what it means, and we'll provide comment as appropriate. We do support continuing to increase to combat climate change. But we've got to dig into the details a little bit more on what's being put out there to make sure that we're -- this is being driven -- able to be driven by customer demand, because anything else is not going to be productive. And then Paul, you can talk about the lithium specifically. Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Colin, obviously, we've been doing a lot of work with multiple partners across the entire battery raw material spectrum. We think that's the prudent thing to do, both for not only from a scarcity perspective, but also making sure we get to a security of supply for our longer-term ambitions. So we're not just looking at, do we do a procurement contract for this year or for that year? We're looking at forming big long-term partnerships. So whether it's the work we did with Lithium Americas, the joint venture that we've done with POSCO, you see these relationships getting set up as structural. And that's where we're really focused to do because we've got the 1 million vehicle target in 2025. We said we're targeting 50% by 2030 and then ultimately, all electric vehicle production in 2035. So building that infrastructure now is where I think we're securing an advantage. Colin Langan : Got it. And you're ahead of your $2 billion annual target for the next 2 years. I just wanted to check, does that incorporate the potential changes in the UAW contract, because that could sort of add some costs? And as also the guidance contemplate things like the signing bonus and stuff like that in terms of cash flow that might occur this year from the UAW contract? Mary Barra : We are -- I mean, we aren't even at the negotiations, and we're not going to negotiate in the media here. We're working to make sure we're building a strong relationship with the new leadership, getting to know them and making sure we identify what are the challenges of the business and then it becomes working together to solve the issues to get to a good place. And so beyond that, we're not going to really comment. But I would say with what we've done in the past, we've always demonstrated that we can continue to drive efficiencies, and that's what we'll do. All right. Well, thanks, everybody. I really appreciate all your questions today. And I want to close by reiterating what I said as we opened the call. I really believe we have the right products and strategies in place to continue to deliver strong results. And although we have a lot of work to do, there's a lot of execution as we ramp up EVs, I believe that's where GM shines. We have the capability to execute, and that's exactly what we're going to do. And I believe that we're going to do it faster than most people think. In addition, this is a milestone year for Cruise as they continue to expand their commercial operations. And with the EVs that we have coming, I really think it's a breakout year for Ultium. So I look forward to sharing updates along the way, and I really appreciate your time today. So I hope everyone has a great day. Operator : Thank you for your participation. Participants, you may disconnect at this time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to General Motors Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, July 25, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO; and Kyle Vogt, CEO of Cruise. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also join us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filing for the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Our operating results continue to demonstrate strong growth, thanks to an incredible customer response to our new trucks and SUVs around the world and strong execution of our business plan by the GM team, our dealers, and suppliers. Together we delivered $3.2 billion in EBIT adjusted in the second quarter, including an $800 million charge for new commercial agreements we have with LGE and LGES. The charge reflects the conscious decision we made during the Chevrolet Bolt EV recalled to serve our customers in ways that go beyond traditional remedies, and we're taking new steps that will reduce our costs and improve our margins over time. We'll provide more details about EV margin improvement and IRA benefits at the Investor Day in November. Our momentum is broad-based. Year-over-year, we have now delivered four consecutive quarters of higher retail market share in the U.S. and our total share was up almost one full point in the first half, with strong pricing and incentive discipline. We lead the U.S. industry in both commercial and total fleet deliveries calendar year to date. We now have led the U.S. industry in initial quality for the second year in a row. We are focused on strong cost discipline and we are taking additional steps to lower our capital spending. All of this impacts the bottom line, so we are raising our full year earnings, free cash flow, and EPS guidance for the second time this year. We now expect full year EBIT adjusted earnings to be in the range of $12 billion to $14 billion up $1 billion from our guidance. Adjusted automotive free cash flow is now expected to be up $1.5 billion in a range of $7 billion to $9 billion, and EPS is now expected to be in a range of $7.15 to $8.15 per share. The actions we are taking to be more efficient are also having an immediate effect on capital spending. We now expect capital spending in 2023 to be in the $11 billion to $12 billion range, which is about a billion less than the high end of our prior guidance, and we are working on more reductions. This guidance assumes that we successfully negotiate new labor agreements without work stoppage. Our results in our new guidance underscore the strength of our products today. Last quarter we talked about new vehicles we're launching to support strong margins. All of them are connecting with customers. At the higher end of the pickup market, the GMC Sierra 84 and Denali models are now 70% of heavy duty retail sales. Premium models also account for more than 70% of sales for the new GMC Canyon mid-sized pickup. For the Chevrolet Colorado, our high performance off-road models, the Z71 Trail Boss and ZR2 represent more than half of retail sales. The new Chevrolet Trax is also off to a very fast start and it's driving solidly profitable growth. In the U.S., we delivered more than 20,000 Trax in the second quarter and we expect that to keep growing. Half of these customers are new to General Motors. All of these new vehicles help us deliver more than a $1,600 per unit increase in the ATPs U.S. compared to first quarter, with flat incentives and essentially flat inventory. We have the largest ATP increase in the industry by far. The other growth products I highlighted last quarter is Chevrolet Montana in South America and the tracks in Korea also continue to build momentum. The Montana is our first compact pickup for the Brazil market and in just four months it has earned one third of the segment. We're now expanding distribution to other markets in South America. In Korea the Trax is an unqualified success just like it is in the U.S. Pricing is strong and has earned more than 50% market share in its segment and two thirds of the customers are new to GM. These hits in the great work the team has done on cost have us on track to deliver significantly higher EBIT adjusted in GM International this year excluding China equity income. Looking ahead we have several launches and growing segments around the world that will keep our momentum going. In North America these include the 2024 Chevrolet Traverse, which we revealed earlier this month. It goes into production in Lansing, Michigan late this year. In the EV market, we achieved our target to produce 50,000 electric vehicles in North America in the first half. About 80% were the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV platform, but the Ultium platform production is increasing. We've had more than 2,000 customer reserve GMC Hummer, EVs and Cadillac LYRIQ in transit to dealers at the end of June. With both cell and vehicle production increasing, we continue to target production of roughly 100,000 EVs in the second half of the year and will continue to grow from there. Demand for our EVs remains very strong because the Ultium Platform is purpose-built for electric vehicles and it does not force customers to compromise on style, performance, utility, range or towing. We have experienced unexpected delays in the ramp because our automation equipment supplier has been struggling with delivery issues that are constraining module assembly capacity. We are working on multiple fronts to put this behind us as quickly as possible and things are already improving. For example we have deployed teams from GM manufacturing engineering to work on site with our automation supplier to improve delivery times. We've also added manual module assembly lines and we're installing more module capacity at our North American EV plants beginning with factory zero and spring hill this summer; Ramos Arizpe in the fall and CAMI in the second quarter of next year. And to address pent-up demand among our Hummer EV customers, we are planning to increase second half production by thousands of units. In the meantime Ultium Cells LLC is delivering great quality and production is ahead of schedule. Looking ahead the next phase of our EV acceleration is coming into sharper focus. For example we have now secured more than half of our 2030 direct sourcing target for many critical raw and process materials we need with significant on-shoring. During the quarter, this included an expansion of our Cathode Active Material joint venture in Canada and an investment to bring manganese sulfate processing to a new facility in Louisiana. As with other recent announcements, these agreements provide us with significant off-take and favorable commercial terms, which is a key component of the EV margin improvement strategy we outlined last quarter. Now let's talk about fixed costs. Due to the success of the $2 billion fixed cost reduction plan we announced earlier this year, we have identified another billion in fixed costs that we will deliver over the same 2023 to 2024 timeframe. This new action will offset about $1 billion in depreciation and amortization, which means that relative to 2022, our automotive fixed costs will be down $2 billion on a net basis as we exit '24. Key components include about $1 billion from the voluntary separation program, another $800 million in reduced sales and marketing expense and the remainder coming from significant reduction in all areas of the business, including engineering expense, travel, and administrative costs. We're not done by any stretch. Mark and I have asked Norm de Greve, our new Chief Marketing Officer to take a fresh review of our spending and put us on a course to deliver world-class levels of marketing efficiency. Our product teams are also embracing a strategy we call winning with simplicity that will reduce design and engineering expense, supplier cost, order complexity, buildable combinations, and manufacturing complexity. For example, our teams are applying even greater discipline around our color and trim pallets, the way we package features and options and reuse. For our EV and ICE vehicles, we are targeting a 50% reduction in trim levels through a smart bundling of customer features and options. This results in fewer part numbers to simplify marketing, engineering, manufacturing, while maintaining the best features customers want. Yet we are maintaining market coverage for all major segments and price points and the U.S. will compete in ICE and EV segments that represent about 90% of the industry volumes in 2030. Our next generation full-size pickup and SUVs will show just how powerful winning with simplicity will be. We are investing significantly less capital and expect to deliver vehicles that will have much higher levels of customer-facing content and even better margins than today. Another great example of a capital efficient program is the next generation Chevrolet Bolt that we plan to execute. Our customers love today's Bolt. It has been delivering record sales in some of the highest customer satisfaction and loyalty scores in the industry. It's also important source of conquest sales for the company and for Chevrolet, more than 70% of customers are new to GM. We will keep some momentum going by delivering a new Bolt that delivers what customers have come to expect, which is great affordability, range and technology and we will execute it more quickly compared to an all-new program and with significantly lower engineering expense and capital investment by updating the vehicle with Ultium and Ultifi technologies and by applying our winning with simplicity discipline. We will have more details to share soon. Now, before we move to Paul's comments and Q&A, I'd like to invite Kyle to update you on the important steps Cruise has taken to scale its business and make it profitable. So, Kyle over to you. Kyle Vogt : Thanks, Mary. We are halfway through our first year of rapid scaling and it's going extremely well. We're on a trajectory that most businesses dream of, which is exponential growth, driven by continuous improvement, engineering innovation and solid product market set. Our formula for driving this growth is quite simple. Number one, we increase the supply of vehicles. Number two, we increase the service availability, some more people can use it and number three, we would make the product awesome. So let's talk about how we're doing on all those and get into the numbers. On the supply side, we recently hit 390 concurrent driverless AVs. We believe this is the largest and fastest growing AV fleet in the world. Yet you will see several times this scale within the next six months. This is all on the Bolt platform, which we can scale the thousands of AVs, but we're also about to transition to origins, which are a game changer for cost and are incredible to write in. And today, I'm pleased to share that our test vehicles are already running in driverless mode on public roads in multiple cities. And we are confident in our regulatory and permitting paths despite this being the first time a major OEM has manufactured a vehicle without traditional controls. As a result, we believe we're the only AV company with a well-defined and significantly de-risk path to reach billions in revenue. On the second item, availability, we're rapidly expanding cities, hours and service area. As very recently, we now operate a significant portion of our San Francisco fleet, 24x7 across the entire city. We've expanded geofences and hours in Austin and Phoenix, and we plan to expand significantly in the next 30 days. Lastly, we've done the prep work and we'll launch commercial service in two or three more cities in the next 12 weeks alone, bringing us to as many as six commercial markets with several more following shortly after. All the critical ingredients, things like mapping, ground infrastructure, validation, user acquisition, etcetera, have become several times more efficient as we move from city to city. On the third, making the product awesome, we have over 85,000, five-star reviews in San Francisco alone. People love the product and it gets better every month with each new software update. And based on data from tens of thousands of users across multiple cities, it's clear to us now that demand will greatly exceed supply for several years, and this gives us margin opportunity and a potential to be a head of plan on revenue growth. Now that is rapid scaling. I'll share a few additional data points before we move on. Cruise cracked three million miles just 49 days after hitting two million miles, and the next million is going to be even faster. We're now doing over 10,000 rides per week, but more importantly, we're growing rides at 49% per month on average over the last six months. 28-day user retention is nearly at the level of a fully matured human ride-hill service, and it continues to turn upwards. The product is extremely sticky despite the limitations in hours and service availability that exist today. All of that scaling is occurring while also improving safety and driving down costs. Let's take a look at those. Safety continues to improve despite increasing complexity. Our analysis of the first million miles shows AVs experience 54% fewer collisions than human drivers in similar environments, and 92% fewer with AV was the primary contributor. In other words, the vast majority of collisions are caused by inattentive or impaired human drivers, not the AV. And we expect a gap between human and AV performance to get much wider over the next 12 months. On the cost side, we're seeing ideal trends. Our operational cost per mile travelled has gone down by an average of 15% per month for the last six months, led by optimizations and infrastructure, process improvements and automation. Our fixed cost due to machine learning training and simulation are also decreasing over time due to better simulation techniques and investments in efficiently, but most exciting is the step function improvements in cost, we will see as our newer vehicles and AV architecture is launched, due to having a much longer service life, the origin significantly reduces our cost per mile. We also have an optimized sensing and compute architecture in late stage development that costs about 75% less than what will be on the very first origins. It's the first time Cruise's custom chips will hit the road, which we expect before the end of next year. As our fleet rolls over to this architecture, we'll start to see costs head below $1 per mile, the magic threshold at which robots actually become cheaper for most people than owning a car. Lastly, we have something else that's fed in the works for a few years that is highly disruptive to the already highly disruptive AV industry, more on that later this year. So putting you things together, it's clear now that Cruise is no longer a science project. There was one significant risk in reasons to doubt, but it's now a rapidly growing business with a transformational product in a multi-trillion dollar TAM. We've made incredible progress in Q2 over Q1, and I'm excited to continue that momentum in the months ahead. We're truly just getting started. Back to you, Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Kyle, and thanks for sharing the progress that the Cruise team is making is just incredible. So, before we move into Paul's remarks, I'd like to address our negotiations with the UAW, which just kicked off and with Uniform. First and most importantly, I want to say how proud I am of our talented and experienced manufacturing workforce. There's a direct connection between their hard work and our success, and we have a great future ahead of us. As we've talked about today, the future includes continued investment in strategic ICE vehicles, like the full-sized trucks, full-sized SUVs, and mid-sized SUVs. Our future also includes retooling existing assembly plans and upscaling the team as we transform the company to grow rapidly in EVs. We have a long history of negotiating fair contracts with both unions that reward our employees and support our long-term success of the business. Our goal this time will be no different. That's the best possible outcome for all of our employees, plant communities, dealers, suppliers, and investors, and we look forward to constructive talks. So, thank you and now let me turn the call over to Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to start by thanking the team for their collaboration on delivering yet another quarter of strong results, and consistently meeting or exceeding our financial targets. At the same time, we are growing the business with four consecutive quarters of year-over-year U.S. retail share growth, and stable incentive spend. The core auto-operating performance continues to fuel the results and fund investments to drive growth in our business, with Q2, even adjusted of $3.2 billion, including the $800 million charge from the LG agreements. We also generated a 7.2% EBIT-adjusted margins, including a 180 basis point headwind from those LG agreements. Aided by a strong consumer and a robust product portfolio, we are raising guidance for the second time this year, driven by great products, successfully balancing supply with demand, and proactive cost management. We have made bold commitments, and to achieve them, we are focusing on a solid foundation. As Mary mentioned, we are well along our way to achieving the $2 billion automotive fixed cost reduction. We are also announcing another $1 billion fixed cost reduction to offset higher depreciation and amortization from the significant manufacturing investments we have been making, and our ICE and EV portfolios. This expands the impact of the plan with the only automotive fixed cost excluded being the lower pension income, a non-operating non-cash item. The product simplification initiatives are expected to have incremental benefits in the years to come, as we refresh future ICE products and transition to EVs. We are also taking a capital-efficient approach to our growth initiatives. For example, we have a profitability-driven strategy towards selectively re-entering Europe, and we recently announced a collaboration with Tesla, the double access to charging for our customers without much incremental investments. Community, these factors, along with a reduction in headcount, marketing spend, and overhead costs, will result in us realizing about a $1 billion of year-over-year fixed cost savings in 2023, with most of this benefit coming in the second half of the year. Getting into the Q2 results, revenue was $44.7 billion up 25% year-over-year driven by supply chain improvements and stable pricing. Wholesale volumes year-over-year were up 20% in Q2 and 12% year-to-date. For the full year we now anticipate being towards the high end of our 5% to 10% guidance range. We achieved $3.2 billion in EBIT adjusted, 7.2% EBIT adjusted margins and $1.91 in EPS diluted adjusted. Total company results were up $900 million year-over-year driven by supply chain improvements versus Q2 2022, but more importantly, we also had a combined $1.4 billion of headwinds from the LG agreements, lower pension income and lower GM financial earnings. ROIC was above our 20% target, demonstrating consistently strong and improving core operating performance. Adjusted auto-free cash flow was $5.5 billion up $4.1 billion year-over-year, driven by improved supply chain conditions and higher earnings year-over-year. During the quarter, we repurchased $500 million stock retiring another $14 million shares bringing the 2023 total to $865 million and 24 million shares retired. We expect our strong balance sheet and cash flow to support continued share repurchases as part of our capital allocation framework moving forward. North America delivered Q2 EBIT adjusted of $3.2 billion up $900 million year-over-year and EBIT adjusted margins of 8.6%. The strength of the product portfolio supported market share growth, higher ATPs and again stable incentives. North America performance was impacted by $700 million of the LG agreement charge, which was a 190 basis point headwind to margin in the segment. We've seen two consecutive quarters of higher warranty related costs, an area we're monitoring very closely. The fundamental quality of our vehicles remain strong as evidenced by the JD Power ratings, however inflationary factors have increased the cost to repair vehicles and we've also seen incremental expenses associated with the recent ARC airbag inflator recall. Total U.S. dealer inventory was 428,000 units at quarter end, essentially flat from last quarter. Inventory on dealer lots of our new and most in-demand vehicles continue to run at around 10 days, including our full size SUVs, the all new Colorado and Canyon mid-size trucks, the Chevrolet Trailblazer and the Chevy Bolt. We are still targeting to end 2023 with 50 days to 60 days of total dealer inventory, although seasonality, production schedules and timing of fleet deliveries may take us out of this range from time to time. Supply chain and logistics challenges are trending in the right direction, however there are ongoing logistics congestion and industry wide railcar capacity shortages that we continue to take actions to mitigate. GM international delivered Q2 EBIT adjusted of $250 million, largely flat year over year. China equity income was $100 million up $150 million year-over-year as we lapped the COVID shutdowns in Q2 of 2022 and aggressively took actions to help offset industry challenge. I'd like to thank the China team for their tireless efforts and perseverance through multiple years in a challenging environment. EBIT adjusted in GM International excluding China equity income was $150 million, down $150 million year-over-year, driven by a $100 million charge from the LG agreements and $150 million of mark-to-market gains recorded in the prior year. Absent these items, the results would have been up year-over-year with price increases more than offsetting FX headwinds due to the strength of the product portfolio, a trend we expect to continue in the second half of the year. GM Financial delivered EBT adjusted of over $750 million down close to $350 million year-over-year in line with expectations and primarily due to a higher cost of funds and lower net leased vehicle income, partially offset by increased finance charge income from portfolio growth and a higher effective yield. GM Financial's key metrics, balance sheet and liquidity remain strong providing them the ability to support the GM enterprise and our customers across economic cycles. As a result, we are taking our full year EBT adjusted guidance up to the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. Corporate expenses were $350 million in the quarter down $400 million year-over-year, primarily due to differences in year-over-year mark-to-market changes in the portfolio. Cruise expenses were $600 million in the quarter, up $50 million year-over-year, driven by an increase in operating spend as they continue to expand operations successfully. As we look forward, due to the strong Q2 core performance and outlook, we are again increasing our full year guidance to EBIT-adjusted in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $7.15 to $8.15 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $7 billion to $9 billion range. Most of the underlying assumptions in our guidance remain unchanged from Q1, with stronger pricing, the main driver behind the increased outlook as we foreshadowed. In addition, we expect better cost performance in commodities and logistics costs to be neutral for the full year. We're bringing the high end of our 2023 capital spend guidance down by $1 billion this year to the $11 billion to $12 billion range in part due to our simplification initiatives. We are evaluating and we'll provide an update on the medium-term capital spend outlook at our Investor Day later in the year, but expect the spend to come down from the previous $11 billion to $13 billion range. For full year adjusted automotive free cash flow guidance, we expect working capital headwinds related to the module assembly challenges Mary mentioned -- offset the benefit from the higher EBIT adjusted lower short-term timing impact result revenue more of cells. But this is expected to unwind as module assembly capacity increases. In closing, we remain very well positioned for the future and achieving our medium and our long-term targets as we've highlighted. We're focusing on profitability, and our recent results demonstrate are not sacrificing margin for volume. We will continue this strategy with the decisions we're making today, helping to drive a fundamentally stronger company beyond 2023. And when you factor in our expected revenue growth, including the opportunities from the software-defined vehicle, AV and other new businesses, this sets us up to grow margin as we get to the back half of the decade. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. Rod Lache : Congratulations on these numbers. I was hoping to maybe ask you for a broader question about EVs. You made some assumptions for EV pricing and EV costs when you laid out your hands for mid-decade profitability. And I'm hoping that you can just update us a little bit on your thinking just based on how the markets evolved with some cases with more aggressive competitive pricing. And obviously, we're also seeing some manufacturers put in different manufacturing innovations to drive down costs. What are your latest thoughts on that? And have any of your observations led you to change any of your plans? Mary Barra : Thanks, Rod, for the question. I would say we're doing a lot in that space. Our -- what we said last year at Investor Day, it gets low to mid-single-digit margins for our EV portfolio by 2025 remains unchanged. Even with all the things that are moving in that, we're committed to getting there. I think when you look at the incredible cost discipline that we're demonstrating right now as well as winning with simplicity. It's just going to take cost out of every part of the business and make everything more efficient. And we think actually be better from a consumer perspective. . As it relates specifically to manufacturing costs, there's quite a bit of work. We have a special team that is looking at how do we continue to drive efficiency, especially in the body shop. And of course, the battery team is working on how do we take cost out from an LTM perspective with what we've learned by now having that up and running. So I think there are several areas we're working on. We intend to have industry-leading margins, and we're not going to stop until we get there and we still have a lot of levers to pull. I don't know, Paul, if you want to add anything. Paul Jacobson : No, I think you covered it. I think, Rod, one of the things that we've asked -- we've been asked on this call frequently is about pricing strategy. And when you look at the demand we have for our vehicles and as we're ramping up production, we still have pent-up demand. People are hanging in there with orders. And I think with some of the challenges identified as we ramp production, we see a lot of consistent strong demand for the products that we're producing. And I think that comes from a purpose-built EV that we did from the ground up, which I think is going to continue to impress people as we get more vehicles out on the road. Rod Lache : Okay. And just a follow-up on that. Just it sounds like you're not changing your expectations for mid-decade pricing. Just wanted to clarify whether there's been any changes based on observations that you've made on capacity growth and competitive actions? And then secondly, can you just maybe elaborate a little bit on this $800 million LG charge? And what that actually means you alluded to lower cost, but it wasn't clear whether that was a one-timer or was that launch cost or something else? Mary Barra : So first of all, on pricing in our plan, of course, we're going to be -- we're going to watch what's going on in the marketplace. But I think one of the things we demonstrated for almost 15 years now is we're going to be very disciplined with incentives and with our vehicles and when I think when you look at the original pricing that we announced I think it was very in line with what the customer expects for the value they're going to see from the products. And so far we're seeing that. So we believe we have priced the vehicles right. Again we have a lot of pent up demand. The feedback we're getting anecdotally for instance, from LYRIQ, new LYRIQ owners is they're just delighted with the vehicle. So I think we've got the pricing strategy right. Of course, we're going to watch it. And we're not changing our mid -- our 2025 EV profitability guidance. We'll pull all the levers that we have to either get there if there's challenges or make it even stronger. So again, Rod, we know it's a dynamic business, but we're committed to get there. And I think this leadership team continues to be able to do what they say. As it relates to the $800 million, there were many issues that we wanted to take care of, but I would say a chunk of it was us doing the right thing for our customers that goes beyond what a traditional recall expense back to a supplier would be as we look at that because we chose to do the right thing from a timing perspective. And I think our customers are happy as evidenced by the still the strong. Actually, we can't build enough Bolts right now. So we'll share more about what everything means for our EV margins when we get to November. But again, we thought it was the right thing to do, and we are -- have been and will continue to work with our partner, LG ES to take cost out of what of the Ultium and specifically the Cells, Operator : Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : And congrats on the results. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the Ultium ramp. First, the issue what you identified with the automation equipment for the modules. Can you talk about when you expect that to be fully resolved? And are you still targeting the $400,000 of cumulative volume by the first half of next year? Mary Barra : Yes, we so we're not walking away from any of the targets we put out, whether it's 100,000 in the second half of this year, leading them to 400,000 by middle of next year. And what you're going to see in the second half of this year and then really crank up in the first half of next year is a lot more Ultium-based product. . We were surprised the supplier, we thought they were in better on track for the delivery that they had. So we have seen in our teams to help them get the automation up and running. We've already seen a lot of improvement from I'll say, the last four to six weeks, we're going to continue on that path. But to derisk it, we've also added additional lines because we don't want module production to gate our launch of all the products that we have coming in the second half of this year and continuing into next. And we know we're going to need that module assembly capability anyway as we continue to grow beyond the 400,000. So disappointing, I've personally been reviewing the lines. As you know, I've spent time in ME earlier in my career running. So we'll get this behind us. I'm very confident of the teams we have in place. So you'll see it improve as we get through I would say, into the end of third quarter, beginning of fourth quarter, and then I think it will primarily be behind us by the end of the year, if not a month or so sooner. Itay Michaeli : Terrific. That's all very helpful. And then just a follow-up on -- broadly on U.S. EV demand. There's been a lot of focus on rising inventory. So just curious how you slot reservation orders as you ramp up Ultium products. And also how you're thinking about the Silverado EV pricing just given the recent action from your competitor. Mary Barra : Yes. So I think from the recent competitive action, if you look at the Silverado work truck, the range, the telling capability, the overall performance. It's a true truck. So when people aren't having to make compromises or trade-offs. So I'm very confident, and we have strong demand for the Silverado work truck as well as the RST, which will be -- that's from a retail perspective out toward the end of the year. So I'm very confident with where we are in the pricing for the Silverado EV. And that's -- your first question, Itay, was... Itay Michaeli : Just probably on EV demand, what you're seeing in reservations and just how confident are you kind of -- what you're seeing for your products in the next few months. Mary Barra : Yes. Again, we're seeing with LYRIQ, we're seeing with the HUMMER truck and SUV, Frankly, the Bolt, I mean these vehicles are getting to the dealers' lots. And if they're not already sold, the -- they've got a list of people who are waiting for them. So -- and we still have a lot of reservations and people who put deposits down. The churn on that is very, very low. And for the rare customer who decides they're not going to wait for the vehicle, there are several more waiting in line. So again, we're very confident. And it's not by accident. It's because we -- there's been some criticism that we should have been faster with our EVs. We're going as fast as we can, but we wanted to make sure we were leveraging a platform that's going to give us efficiency with Ultium and that consumers weren't going to have to compromise. So I'm very confident with the product portfolio we have coming, the pricing and the demand. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : GM had strong pricing and mix again in the second quarter even as supply and inventory for the industry are gradually recovering and borrowing costs for consumers are higher. You talk about how you expect the market environment to evolve in the second half of the year? And are there any levers for GM in particular in order to help to sustain some of the strong core automotive performance that you've been seeing? . Paul Jacobson : Mark, it's Paul. Thanks for the question. We're still kind of operating somewhat cautiously as we said from the beginning of the year. We're not assuming major increases in pricing or in average transaction prices going forward. So we expect that to continue, and it really starts with the demand that we see for our vehicles. We've tried to keep inventory pretty consistent. We've grown it a little bit to get it to the lower end of that 50- to 60-day range that we're working on. But overall, maintaining discipline on the incentive side as well. So we've really been focused on driving share with margin performance. I think the team has done a good job. As to whether that will continue, we're kind of taking it day by day, month by month. And we're very pleased with the results. But as long as we see demand continuing to be as strong as it is for our vehicles, we think we're going to continue to perform. Mark Delaney : That's helpful. And on Cruise and good to hear all of the updates on the progress that Cruise is making. I recall you mentioned Cruise vehicles being safer by 54%. Maybe you can elaborate a bit on how you're measuring the safety of the vehicles that Cruise has with its AVs relative to a human driver. And are there any specific features on the origin as it relates to safety that you could point out as perhaps drivers of additional improvement going forward? Kyle Vogt : Yes, sure. I'd be happy to. So clarify the 50-some-percent number was a reduction in any kind of collision. And the way that we measure that as we looked at the first 1 million miles of driving across the Cruise fleet and compare that to a human benchmark that we established with leading transportation research institute. And that was based on millions of miles of driving by human drivers then selected a subset of all those miles and matched it to EV drive. So as close as possible to it, apples-to-apples comparison. But beyond that, 50-some percent collision reduction doesn't really tell the whole story because that includes things where the AV was sitting still and just got rare ended by driver. That's not really the fault of AV. When you look at collisions where the AV was the primary contributor, 92% fewer collisions. So most of the time, it's the other vehicle that's the primary contributor towards any collision that we've seen. And then I guess another one we're really proud of is AV is it 73% fewer collisions with meaningful risk of injuries. These are the more severe types of collisions, not just the low-speed fender benders. So all these in aggregate tell a very compelling story. And I would emphasize that this is still -- this is the product as it exists today, and we push out a new software update each month, which targets specific kinds of safety improvements. So I think there was a question early on, on how the AVs do relative to humans. I think our data shows that we're already at least from this data, there's strong evidence of significant safety improvements. And I think it's going to continue improving at a rapid clip as we continue to invest in machine learning technologies and other ways to drive up the safety of the product. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to ask a question like we often do on cap viewed. I mean 102.7 in North America. A skeptic might say, hey, listen, you're running all out and as you bring on more volume, you're going to need to add fixed costs and variable costs. And with the risk of pricing coming down, you can see real compression in margin. But an optimist might say, listen, that's staff capacity, pricing will hold up and you'll just bring on variable costs as volumes recover. I'm just curious where in the spectrum, I think you actually are in sort of that range because it does seem like there's some real opportunity if pricing holds up and you just bring on these variable costs, but there might be some real significant upside to margins over time. . Paul Jacobson : Yes. So certainly, that has been part of what's been working for us for the first six months. And despite that higher capacity utilization, you're seeing inventory remaining pretty much flat with a lot of the inventory growth or inventory still strapped in that in-transit bucket. As vehicles are making their way to the dealers, we see them still turning very, very quickly, and that's allowed us to continue to lean into the pricing and make sure that we've got consistent incentive performance. And I think you've seen some outperformance from GM over the last several months in that space compared to the industry as a whole. So I think we've shown a willingness to balance supply with demand as we did in the first quarter, where we cut some of the capacity utilization intentionally to make sure that we kept margins flat or kept -- sorry, inventory flat and margins strong. So we're going to continue to watch that. But as we've seen, it's provided tremendous benefits for us so far, and we're going to continue to manage it that way. John Murphy : But if you were to flex up on volume, would it be mostly a variable cost that would come in? Or would there need to be some fixed costs that would come along with that step-up of buying with. Paul Jacobson : Yes, it would be mostly variable costs. But when you think about where the company is being utilized, it's at the higher end now, with the demand that we've seen for the higher trim levels on the full-size trucks, SUVs, et cetera. So we might not be able to do it in a linear way. where you've got some mix if you're increasing production on some of the lower-priced smaller vehicles across the board. So we watch that and try to maintain as much balance as we can. John Murphy : Okay. Just a follow-up on fleet. Fleet has been a real good guy for you and the industry. When you think about the durability and resilience of that in the face of even potentially some risk to the economy here, how durable is that. And is there just massive pent-up demand on the fleet that might carry the day even if rates were a little bit higher and we see a little bit of a soft patch in the economy? . Paul Jacobson : Yes. I think you captured it well, John. Obviously, we've got a lot of pent-up demand from the last few years where fleet took the brunt of some of the capacity challenges due to COVID and due to the semiconductor challenges. In fact, if you look at the first half of the year, year-to-date, it was the best fleet performance since 2007, largely fueled by the commercial side of the business. And as we've said before, the fleet business is very different than it was in the past, where it was very, very thin margins in an effort to drive volume. Our fleet business is performing very, very well with margins similar to the retail side. So the business continues to perform, the team is doing a great job, and we expect that to continue for the short and medium term. John Murphy : I'm sorry, just one housekeeping question. The 792 charge for the LG issue, was that contemplated in your initial guidance? Because if it wasn't, it's actually -- the raise today is more like a $1.8 billion raise in the outlook. I'm just trying to understand if you were contemplating that before? Paul Jacobson : It's contemplated a guidance raise itself. It wasn't contemplated as we came into the year. John Murphy : Okay. So the raise is significant today. It's actually more than $1 billion on operating basis if you were to back that out. Is that fair. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Like we said, the business continues to perform going back to what we said in the first quarter as long as the consumer held up and strong, we expected that we'd be able to surpass the guidance we put out and that certainly what you've seen through the second quarter and what we can see July month-to-date has held up very well as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : So a question on the new Bolt. I think in your prepared remarks, you said it will be updated with Ultium and Ultifi technology. Sorry to be pedantic here, but I just want to know, are you using attributes of Ultium? Or is this a full ground-up Ultium platform? Mary Barra : So it will incorporate -- when the new version comes out, we will say it's an Ultium-based product. So we are definitely leveraging that technology because that's going to really help us get costs down. Remember, today's Bolt is our second-generation battery technology and from Gen 2 to Ultium. We saw about a 40% reduction as we started to launch. So that's going to really help drive the profitability of that vehicle. And then with the work that we've done from a software-defined vehicle, Ultifi, it will have latest from that perspective as well. So this is a very capital-efficient quick way to build. And the strong consumer response we have to the Bolt and getting affordable vehicle out into the marketplace. So as we continue to look for ways to drive capital efficiency, this is something we look before. But as we've gotten more experience, the team took a look and frankly, I'm super excited about it. Adam Jonas : Okay. Just a follow-up. Audi announced it's going to use SAIC's next-gen EV platform for China and possibly, elsewhere. Since SAIC is your biggest Chinese JV partner. I'm just wondering, could GM also consider using SAIC's EV platform to address the specific needs of the Chinese EV consumer? Or is the strategy there kind of Ultium only for China? Like are you open to a potential use of another non-Ultium platform even if you could adapt some technology. Mary Barra : Yes, Adam. Great question. I think the Ultium platform is much more efficient. I think they've already indicated that their dedicated platform wasn't competitive from a cost perspective. We're continuing to take costs out of Ultium. But of course, we always look at what the joint venture partner can bring to the party, and we're going to look to make sure that we're competitive from an EV perspective in that market as well. So we are open and always considering whatever is the most cost-effective way to have a vehicle that's going to have no compromises to meet the performance of, in this case, the Chinese consumer. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Dan Levy : First, I just wanted to ask about the commentary on CapEx, which you noted the $11 billion to $13 billion for '24, '25 is under review. You trimmed the CapEx for 2023. Maybe you can just give us a sense of how you're looking at the manufacturing build-out. I think you noted that there's some simplification initiatives. Is that just something that was incremental? Or was that a byproduct perhaps looking at the market a little differently in terms of demand. I guess we're just wondering is that the slowdown in spend just purely the simplification. Or is there something else on the manufacturing side with market demand that's causing you to slow down a little bit the way that you're spending? Mary Barra : As there was no market-driven slowdown, this was really us looking and making sure we had the absolute right portfolio entries. And as I mentioned, for both EV and ICE we're going to -- by 2030, we'll be covering 90% of the segments, but we looked and found ways to do that more efficiently. The Bolt is a good example, instead of doing an all-new vehicle really leveraging the capital that's already there and the benefits we have by having the Ultium platform. And then I think the winning with simplicity, in the past, we've gone in and done complexity reduction. But if you don't do it as you design the vehicle, you drive a lot of capital in vendor tooling and in the plant. And frankly, this is something we've been working on for the last several months. Mark Reuss is leading this initiative with the marketing and manufacturing teams. And we are finding, there's a lot of ways to take cost out of manufacturing and from a capital perspective as well. So it's pretty significant. You'll hear and see more about it. But just the comment I made about getting rid of trims that directly correlates to spending less capital, especially on the vendor tooling side. Dan Levy : And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to pass the question on this -- on the charge associated with the Bolt. And really, this pegs the question, Ultium is a new product, and I think there's a lot of unknowns with the new product. How should we think about the type of warranty expense you may need to accrue on these products, how much more -- I mean, is there a need to be an added level of conservatism as the ramping? Or is there some clear data that you have that shows just early on that the quality will be far greater than the initial Bolt, which was -- you've clearly evolved on your architectures. But just wondering how you need to think about warranty expense going forward on the new vehicles . Mary Barra : Yes. I would say if you go back, the Bolt's been in market for several years now and actually had very good warranty performance. Remember, this was two specific manufacturing defects that have occurred at the same time, caused the issue on the Bolt that was in the LG ES process. We -- our team worked hand-in-hand with them. We understand exactly what happened. When you look at what we're doing at the Ultium plants from a cell perspective and the amount of error proofing and the fact that we're following the quality process and have the traceability that if there were an issue, we wouldn't have to do the whole population. All of that's been put in place. So I think all those lessons learnt. Then when you look at what we've got from an Ultium perspective already and what we're seeing, I think we're very confident that we're going to see strong or I would say, good warranty performance, strong warranty performance on these vehicles because, again, using General Motors manufacturing quality systems and processes across the board. So I don't think that because it's new, I think some of the things we're struggling with to start up with our suppliers is the modules, that's not going to necessarily drive a quality issue. Again, we have quality checks and processes and using the appropriate error proofing to know that when we have a cell, when we have a module when we have a pack, it's measured and checked for quality. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Chris McNally : I wanted to quickly go back to the $30 billion autonomous elephant in the room. And just a quick tech question for Kyle. So Assuming that the San Francisco policy update goes in sort of the industry's favor, do you just have a broad sense for when the 24x7 rollout will happen in San Francisco quarter, the consumer rides, I know there's internal testing where you're blanketing the city, but just curious on the consumer side. And then just how many AVs would it take to sort of blanket a city like San Francisco to have a disruptive service similar to Uber. Can you do it with under 1,000 to 2,000 origin? Kyle Vogt : Yes, good question. So on the San Francisco side, so right now, as I said earlier, a significant portion of our fleet is operating 24x7, and that service is open to employees. So we are not far from opening that up to the general public. I can't give specific dates. But basically, we're operating that service to employees. Things are looking pretty good. So that is coming pretty soon. And as for what it would take to blanket a city like San Francisco, our goal is, as I think I said on previous calls is to make sure that we ramp up manufacturing capacity. We've got a variety of markets to absorb those vehicles. And there are practical reasons to ramp up gradually in the city, just to make sure it acclimates as it's transitioning to a new form of mobility. So it's not our intention just to sort of vehicles and sort of direct them all into a single city. That's our perspective. There's over 10,000 human ride hill drivers in San Francisco, potentially much more than that, depending on how you count it. Those drivers, of course, aren't working 20 hours a day like a robotaxi could. So it does not make a very high number to generate significant revenue in a city like San Francisco. But certainly, there's capacity to absorb several thousand per city at minimum. Chris McNally : Much appreciate it. And then just a high-level question on the strategy for whoever comes to capital funding. Mary, it looks like there's about 3-plus type quarters before you'd have to sort of consider funding Cruise? Just any thoughts on internal versus external funding given the environment. Mary Barra : I don't really have anything to comment right now. We certainly are generating the free cash flow that we can fund Cruise's expansion, and we'll look to see what's in the best interest of our shareholders. . Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC. Tom Narayan : Mary, a question -- maybe a philosophical one on autonomy and how you view Ultra Cruise. In light of what we heard from Tesla and how they are potentially planning to license an FSD product. Just curious to how you view Ultra Cruise, would that be a revenue profit center? Or just a product enhancer. How do you see the kind of Level 2 plus product for you? Mary Barra : We definitely see the Level 2 plus product as revenue-generating and profit-generating and very pleased with what we have with Super Cruise, and we're going to continue to enhance as we move forward. And we'll have more to share about this when we get to Investor Day in the fall. Tom Narayan : Okay. And as a follow-up on Cruise. You made a strong case, obviously, on the safety features. Just wondering if you could give some color on how perhaps you're arguing that on a regulatory perspective, maybe on a federal level, like what are kind of the obstacles? And I mean, is that you see happening more likely now? Is there kind of a greater appeal now that you're seeing all these safety benefits? Is it a stronger case now than maybe it was before? Mary Barra : I think as we continue to grow in miles, but first of all, we're not arguing with the regulators. We're talking to the regulators and sharing the information, which we've been doing for several years now. And so they understand how we're measuring safe with what Kyle referred to with what we did with outside groups and continuing to share the information. I think it's very goal aligned with what the Department of Transportation and NYCTA is looking for us to improve road safety. So of course, we're going to continue that dialogue, share the information, and we're very optimistic of where we're headed. . Operator : Our last question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. It looks like the China equity income in 2Q was similar to 1Q, rounding to $21 billion, down from sort of $0.2 billion a year ago and of course, $0.5 billion quarterly pre-pandemic. What is required, do you think to restore China profitability to where you would like it to be, I don't know, from a sales or a share or perspective? It seems like you've got really great traction in that market for lower-priced EVs, such as for the Wuling brand. How should we think about your strategy for electrifying your high-end brands in China? Is that the catalyst do you think to higher profits in that market? Mary Barra : Well, definitely, we have strong ICE products and performance there are already clear to winning as we go forward is having the right portfolio of EVs for Cadillac and Buick especially. And so we have a lot of those vehicles being launched right now, and we're continuing to work to make sure they're efficient in meeting the customer needs. But let's also remember, right now, we're in the high single-digit market -- market share place right now even with all the -- in fact that there's 100 new EV entries. So we've got to have the right EVs at the right price with the right technology. I was over there I guess, maybe two months ago now and did a full review of our product line and obviously spent time understanding where the competition is. I think we've got the right products coming. We've got to go out there and sell them now engage our team to get that done. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. And then just maybe lastly on the Bolt charge. Is the charge driven more by something differently being done for the consumer versus what was previously communicated? Or is it more of a like rejiggering of the cost-sharing agreement between GM and LG for the previously announced actions? Mary Barra : Well, for a portion of it, obviously, as you announced the recall and then you look what it's going to take, we took some time working with the LG ES team to come up with a diagnostic that then over a period of time indicates that the vehicle can go from the reduction of 80% battery charge to the -- back to the full battery charge. That took a little longer. And so as we did that, we wanted to make sure we were taking care of the consumers, replacing the battery packs maybe faster than what we would have ended up needing to do. And just having attention to them because again, we have a very strong Bolt customer, and we wanted to make sure that they understood we're going to stand behind it. So I think we took the right actions. And as we looked at that, where we were as we were well into having that issue behind us, we looked at what was right from where the costs fell. So we just were doing the right thing. LG is a very strategic partner to us. And like I said, there's a lot of work that we're doing together and individually to continue to improve our cost position. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for closing comments. Mary Barra : Thank you so much, and I want to thank everybody for your questions. As I said at the opening of the call, the success we've had in the second quarter and the first half ties directly to the great new vehicles we've launched and strong execution of our business plan. Our outlook, both for the second half and over the next several years, will increasingly be shaped by our optimized ICE and EV portfolio, our investment that we're making, not only in the vehicles, but also the growth opportunities as well as cost discipline. And -- this will be the focus of our next Investor Day that's going to be held in mid-November. The agenda will include a detailed look at our software strategy, led by Mike Abbott, who joined us from Apple in May. You're also going to have the opportunity to drive our new STBs and experience the expanding capabilities, as I mentioned, of Super Cruise. And one of the most important vehicles you're going to get to drive is the new Chevrolet Silverado EV work truck that we talked about it. I think most powerful examples of the benefits of the investment we made starting in 2018 on the Ultium platform. It offers up to 40% more driving range, faster charging and far greater towing capability than competitors because, again, it was purpose built to be an EV. And that's something that we've made the investments. We were going through the growing pains right now. Others they're going to need to do that as they get to their dedicated platform. So I'm very excited about what we're doing to be able to demonstrate in November and just know that we're going to continue to execute with discipline across all aspects of the business as we are in Q3 and into Q4. So appreciate everyone and look forward to seeing you then and probably talk to most of you before then. So thanks for your participation. And I hope everybody has a great day.

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, Tuesday, October 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations Web site. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also join us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin by thanking the entire GM team for once again delivering very strong results, including $3.6 billion of EBIT-adjusted in the third quarter. Our supply chain team and logistics partners in North America have done great work improving the flow of vehicles from our assembly plants to our dealers. Our U.S. dealers have helped us outperform the market from a share standpoint with strong ATPs, and essentially flat incentives. We were profitable in every region, including China. And GM International is on track to deliver significantly higher EBIT in 2023 compared to a year ago thanks to our operating discipline and the lift we're getting from successful vehicles like the Chevrolet Montana and the Trax. I'd also like to recognize our teams in Canada and Korea. They reached new competitive labor agreements and ratified them with little or no disruption to our operations. Because we are in a highly competitive cyclical industry, we have been laser-focused on four fundamentals to strengthen our position; they are delivering vehicles that customers love and are willing to pay for, a competitive cost structure, marketing efficiency and incentive discipline, and matching production to demand. Driving these fundamentals has been and will continue to be the foundation of our consistently strong earnings. For example, GM has now led the industry in full-size pickup sales for three consecutive years, and we have led full-size SUVs for nearly 50 years. Our overall incentives have gone from consistently above the industry average to consistently below. And we are on track to exit 2024 with fixed costs that are $2 billion lower net of increased depreciation and amortization than 2022. And we're launching several new SUVs this year and next year that will be more profitable than the models they replace. We're also taking immediate steps to enhance the profitability of our EV portfolio and adjust to slowing near-term growth. These steps include moderating the pace of our EV acceleration in 2024 and 2025 to maintain strong pricing. The new launching timing at Orion Assembly also enables us to make engineering and other changes that will make the trucks more efficient and less expensive to produce, and therefore more profitable. Let's dig a little deeper into the steps we're taking with our ICE portfolio to keep margins and EBIT strong in a very competitive environment. Over the last several years, we have bolstered our position in high-margin segments, including full-size pickups, full-size SUVs, and large luxury SUVs. We did this by managing capacity to meet demand, expanding the range of premium trim series that we offer, and with innovations like Super Cruise and the MultiPro Tailgate, and factory-lifted trucks. And we're not going to let up. As I said, we're launching a wide range of SUVs that will have automotive gross margins up to five points higher than the models they replace. The first two are the Chevrolet Trax and Buick Envista. These affordable small SUVs are rapidly gaining market share, and more than 50% of the Chevrolet Trax customers are new to GM. Then, in the first-half of 2024, we begin launching the new Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and Buick Enclave, followed by the next generation of the ICE Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain, which begin launching mid year. Here are the profit drivers. First, they are in growth segments. The larger SUVs compete with in a segment that we expect to grow by 25%, to three million units, over the next three years, and the smaller SUVs compete in the industry's largest segment, which we expect to grow 9% to 3.4 million over that same period. Second, they're outstanding products. They offer more comfort and interior roominess, better cargo space, enhanced safety features, and innovative technologies, including Super Cruise, which will be a segment exclusive in the Traverse. And third, we develop them efficiently. We have simplified the powertrain lineups where we're using 60% of the power and reduce build combination by 80% to 90%. Now, let's look at EVs. Our commitment to an all-EV future is as strong as ever, and we continue to plan to have annual EV capacity of 1 million units in North America as we exit 2025. This will allow us to participate in the EV market upside, but we are also scaling in a way that's consistent with the operating discipline I mentioned. Over the course of 2023, our battery cell manufacturing joint venture in Ohio has made tremendous progress. The plant will be running at full capacity next month, as planned, and they are targeting the production of 36 million cells this year. Next year, production in Ohio is expected to rise to 100 million cells. At the same time, our battery module constraint is getting better, which helped us more than double the Ultium platform production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. And we are now in the process of installing and testing our high-capacity module assembly lines, which will continue into the first part of next year. We are currently challenged getting some of the critical equipment components, but we have a dedicated team working with our suppliers to resolve all issues and get these lines running at rate. By mid-year, we expect that modules will no longer be a constraint, and we will be focused on building to customer demand rather than setting new production targets. Software is another critical piece of the strategy, and Mike Abbott and his team are actively engaged in the early assessment and in each of these launches. Since he joined our team this summer, Mike has been moving aggressively to build a world-class software organization to fully execute our software-defined vehicle strategy while accelerating our vision. We now have executives with experience from Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber, and other leading tech companies heading up our human interface design group, our product software and services group, our software engineering, and our software strategy group. The team is optimizing the software strategy and fine-tuning the plans for our new vehicles to help make sure we executive with the highest possible quality and customer experience, while positioning the company to drive significant revenue growth from subscriptions in the future. To give the team time to do this, we'll move out the launches of three products, the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Silverado EV RST, and the GMC Sierra EV Denali, each by only a few months. This will ensure their success. We believe our products will succeed, and the costs are coming out quickly. For example, our cost per cell has already decreased 45% over the last 12 months as production volume in Ohio has ramped up. We also expect to achieve significant margin improvement on our battery electric trucks through engineering efficiency and improvement, supplier cost, and reducing order complexity, buildable combinations, and manufacturing. Another key launch for us is the next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV. I know there has been some speculation in the market as to why we are developing a new Bolt EV. Our strategy is to build -- is to build on the tremendous equity we have in the brand and to do it as efficiently as possible. Our prior portfolio plans included several newly designed vehicles in the entry level segments and a capital commitment of $5 billion over the next several years. ,: So, now let's turn to Cruise. Since the early days of our company, GM has been defining the future of transportation. And today, that's more true than ever with Cruise. In February, we celebrated Cruise becoming the first company to [eclipse] (ph) 1 million driverless miles. Fast-forward to today and they have logged more than 5 million miles, and they continue to expand. Just last week, we announced that GM and Cruise are working with Honda to bring driverless rides to Tokyo in early 2027. We'll do that with our Origin, the world's first-ever vehicle purpose-built for autonomous driving on public roads. As Cruise continues to push the boundaries of what AV technology can deliver society, safety is always at the forefront. And this is something they are continuously improving. In fact, it's our zero crash vision that keeps us pressing forward. And we know from the data that Cruise AVs are involved in far fewer collisions than human drivers. This remains the focus of their ongoing discussions with government partners and regulators at the federal and state levels. And now, let's talk about strikes. We know we have ongoing strikes at some of our U.S. facilities. I know many of you are concerned about the impact of higher labor cost on our business in the U.S. Let me address this head-on. I'll start with the macro environment. And then, I'll cover how we are positioned to -- positioning the business for success. It's been clear coming out of COVID that the wages and benefits across the U.S. economy would need to increase because of inflation and other factors. This has been playing out in many sectors for some time now. I believe that the offer we have on the table with the UAW is better than the contracts that employees at companies like Caterpillar, UPS, and Kaiser Permanente have ratified. The current offer is the most significant that GM has ever purposed to the UAW. The majority of our workforce will make $40.39 per hour or roughly $84,000 a year in salary by the end of this agreement's term. It also includes the cost of living reinstatement, a 25% increase to the company's 401(k) contributions, world-class healthcare with no out-of-pocket premiums or deductibles for our senior members, and enhanced paid time off, and several other benefits. Since negotiations started this summer, we have been available to bargain 24/7 on behalf of our represented team members and our company. They have demanded recorded contract. And that's exactly what we have offered for weeks now, a historic contract with record wages that have increases that are substantial, record job security, and world-class healthcare. It's an offer that rewards our team members, but does not put the company and their jobs at risk. Accepting unattainably high cost that would put our future and the GM team members' job at risk is simply something that I will not do. Clearly, given the industry's changing pricing and demand outlook and higher labor cost, we have work to do to ensure we achieve low-to mid-single digit EBIT on EV margins targets that we have laid out for 2025. The work has already begun. And I am confident we will achieve our targets and grow from there. So, when you add up all the things we have talked about so far, it should be more clear than ever that we have taken and will continue to take decisive steps to grow our revenue while sustaining strong 8% to 10% EBIT margins in North America through 2025. We are optimizing both our ICE portfolio and our cost structure to continue to deliver strong profits. We are strengthening our EV business. And then, we will accelerate further. And we have assembled a world-class team to deliver new high margin reoccurring revenue streams from software defined vehicles. It does remain a truly exciting time for us. Now, I'll ask Paul to take you through the third quarter financials in greater detail. And then, we will move to G&A. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by thanking our team members for once again delivering strong results in the face of several challenges. To those employees that continue to build vehicles through the uncertainties of the UAW strike, thank you for your focus, your commitment to quality, and passion to deliver great products to our customers. In Q3, the UAW strike had a roughly $200 million EBIT impact, and so far in Q4, we estimate the lost production has had an incremental $600 million EBIT impact. Moving forward, we estimate that the impact of the UAW strike to be approximately $200 million per week based on the facilities impacted as of yesterday. We're not going to speculate on the duration and the extent of the UAW strike, and because of this uncertainty, we've chosen to withdraw our 2023 full-year guidance metrics even though our strong underlying business fundamentals were pushing us towards the upper half of the range prior to any strike impacts. After we have a ratified contract, we will provide an investor update to quantify the final impact of the strike as well as labor costs moving forward. Despite these challenges, we're already working to offset the incremental costs. Mary mentioned the great work the team is doing with the net $2 billion fixed cost program announced earlier in the year, and the winning with simplicity initiative to drive further efficiencies and cost savings. Higher labor costs will make it even more imperative that we continue to focus on the most significant and margin accretive parts of the business. Let's move now to the Q3 results. Total company revenue was up 5% to more than $44 billion, driven primarily by our consistent pricing and higher wholesale volumes, which were up 2% year-over-year. We achieved $3.6 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 8.1% EBIT-adjusted margins, and $2.28 in EPS diluted adjusted, inclusive of the $200 million UAW strike impact during the quarter. Production volumes and pricing were up year-over-year. However, these benefits were more than offset from other parts of the business normalizing, including mix and GM financial, along with our continued investments in EVs and crews, resulting in a $700 million decrease year-over-year. Adjusted auto free cash flow was $4.9 billion, up $0.3 billion year-over-year, driven by the continued strength of our core auto operating performance. North America continued to deliver strong results, with $3.5 billion in EBIT-adjusted. Pricing continued to be robust, and we are starting to see the benefits of our fixed cost reduction program, realizing about $500 million year-over-year savings in Q3 from lower people cost and marketing savings. Expected headwinds from pension income, warranty costs, and mix, along with the impact of the UAW strike, more than offset these tailwinds, resulting in a $400 million decrease year-over-year. As we shared in our prior quarter's update on warranty costs, the quality of our vehicles continues to be strong, as demonstrated by the decrease in claim rates year-over-year. However, we have experienced an increase in the cost of repairing vehicles due to inflationary factors. We are committed to reducing the number of claims and finding efficiencies to minimize costs and are optimistic that year-over-year warranty headwinds will begin moderating in Q4. EBIT-adjusted margin was 9.8%, and at the top of our 8% to 10% target range. In the U.S., we continue to drive profitable market share growth with 0.7 percentage points year-over-year in Q3, growing both retail and fleet share. At the same time, we continue to hold incentive spend consistently low and reduce marketing spend by $200 million year-over-year. We have completely modified our approach to incentives over the last few years. J.D. Power PIN data shows our 2021 U.S. incentive spent as a percentage of ATP was one percentage point above the industry average of 6%. In 2023, we are trending about a half a percentage point below the industry average of 3.7%. This $1,500 per vehicle relative performance improvement from 2021 to 2023 equates to more than $3.5 billion in annualized EBIT improvements and is attributable to our strong product portfolio and disciplined inventory strategy. And as Mary mentioned, new and updated products coming in 2024 will have improved profitability, bold designs, and new technology to help continue our sales and pricing momentum. Total U.S. inventory has remained within our 50 to 60-day range, with a slight sequential increase to 443,000 units at the end of Q3. This is a testament to the hard work of our team who have navigated through the continued logistics challenges and uncertainties related to the UAW strike. GM International had a solid Q3 performance with Q3 EBIT-adjusted of $350 million, which was consistent year-over-year. Despite a decrease of $150 million in China equity income, which amounted to $300 million for the quarter, GM International ex-China EBIT adjusted, was $150 million, a significant improvement from breakeven, in 2022. I want to take a moment to take the entire International team for the work they're doing to deliver profitable results, including the actions in China to help mitigate some of the industry challenges. GM Financial had a strong quarter, with an EBT-adjusted of $750 million, their fourth highest Q3 ever in spite of higher interest rates and lower used car values. This performance was in line with expectations and primarily due to lower net leased vehicle income. We also saw increased finance charge income associated with portfolio growth, and a higher effective yield offset by that increased interest expense. Corporate expenses were $300 million in the quarter, and consistent with the prior year. Cruise expenses were $700 million in the quarter, and we expect a similar quarterly run rate moving forward as they balance expanding operations with further efficiencies. A larger fleet of AVs and additional resources drove the incremental $200 million of expenses year-over-year. I also want to highlight a few items Mary on our retimed EV volume and product production decisions. These actions will impact our previous EV production targets, including the 100,000 EV target we had for the second-half of 2023, and cumulative 400,000 EVs from 2022 to the first-half of 2024. We are not providing new targets, but are moving to a more agile approach to continually evaluate EV demand and adjust production schedules to maximize profitability. We purposely built flexibility into our manufacturing facilities, and are uniquely positioned among our competitors to be able to flex our production between ICE and EVs. For example, our Ramos facility builds both ICE and EV variants of the Blazer and the Equinox, along with Spring Hill, which builds the Cadillac LYRIQ along with existing ICE vehicles. These actions prioritize Ultium profitability versus volume, which helps solidify our North America EBIT-adjusted margin target of 8% to 10% through 2025, and the cash flows funding our future in EVs, AVs, software-defined vehicles, and other new businesses. Given a more agile approach to our EV transition, we now expect to retime at least $1.5 billion of capital spending at our Orion plant, implement engineering improvements, and improve EV profitability prior to accelerating production of battery electric trucks. We'll provide more detail around EV profitability once we have clarity on labor costs. In closing, I want to emphasize that our EV momentum is building. We see it in everything from cell production, to manufacturing, to software. We continue to install significant EV capacity, and have the agility and decisiveness to make further adjustments to both accelerate or moderate our transition to adapt to customer preferences. Higher labor costs are at the top of everyone's mind, but will likely be another example of the numerous challenges this team has tackled over the last few years. And I remain confident we'll continue to execute and find solutions to grow EPS moving forward. The cost initiatives we're implementing are not one and done, but rather a change in mindset that we expect will drive efficiencies for years to come, fundamentally strengthening the company. This concludes our opening statements. And we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Rod Lache : Morning, everybody. Mary Barra : Morning, Rod. Rod Lache : I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the slower demand growth for EVs. Obviously, GM is just getting started now with mass market Ultium products, still the fastest growth segment within the market. And just at a high level, is this kind of an assessment of the premium that you think EV buyers are willing to pay or are you less optimistic on the IRA becoming a point of sale benefit next year? And just given the investments that you're making, why wouldn't lower volume or pricing assumptions affect the 2025 EV earnings expectations? Paul Jacobson : What I would say is the observation about slowing EV demand growth is something that everybody's been talking about. We've seen it in competitor earnings profiles, et cetera, but I want to be clear, we're not seeing that in our portfolio right now. Now, admittedly, that's in considerably lower volumes than some others that are out there, but we continue to see strong demand for our portfolio, and we're making progress on increasing Ultium EV production, with Ultium products up 2x 3Q versus 2Q. So, we are scaling. But what we've seen here is an opportunity to slow some of that scaling down and take advantage of some of the learning that we've seen through the engineering and manufacturing process in the early stages. And what it allows us to do is to build a stronger foundation before we scale aggressively upwards. So, that's really what we're seeing. I wouldn't chalk it up necessarily to price. And what we're seeing in our portfolio is our customers have been remarkably resilient in the order book, continuing to keep their orders on the books. Rod Lache : Great, thanks, Paul. And just secondly, obviously there's consequences to almost any change that affects the business. At a high level, do you think that GM will need to make adjustments to the company's product strategy to adjust for higher labor costs than some of your competitors? And can you clarify whether this $2 billion net fixed cost reduction contemplates a scenario for UAW costs? Mary Barra : Rod, this is Mary. Yes, we're committed to the $2 billion that we've talked about. And we already have tremendous work underway to continue to take costs out of the business. So, I don't really think this changes our product portfolio. As Paul said, as we get further into the transformation to EV, it's a bit bumpy, which is not unexpected. And so, what we're moving to is something that we can react in a much more agile way to make sure that we have the right vehicles. And I believe our portfolio that we have that looks at the most important segments, and make sure that we have the right entries. We're already seeing strong demand for entries when we have EVs that people actually want to buy. So, I think there is a lot of focus in the portfolio to have the right cells, but just to give ourselves more flexibility. And I think the Bolt EV versus the previous [AV] (ph) that we had in the portfolio was a great example. We were able to get the Bolt EV more quickly. As we've mentioned, it will require a lot less capital deploy. And frankly, we're leveraging the strong customer enthusiasm that people have for the Bolt EV. So, it's decisions like that where we're still going to have the right portfolio but do it more effectively from a cost and timing perspective. Rod Lache : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone. So just first going back to the Ultium targets in 2025, could you just review the factors that are allowing you to maintain that low-to-mid single-digit EV margin target? Given the lower volume, maybe you could touch upon any changes to the LG relationship, from maybe recent changes there? And also, if you could quantify a bit some of the engineering changes you alluded to that can enhance profitability? Mary Barra : Sure, thanks, Itay. And exactly as Paul said, we're taking steps to better position ourselves as we expand. But we are very much committed to the low-to-mid single-digit margin target in 2025 for our EVs. And it's not one thing, it's multiple things. So, first, as I mentioned just a minute ago, it's having the right products in the right segments that have the right features, the right range, the right functionality, et cetera. That's number one. And I think the Silverado EV is a prime example when you look at the range that vehicle has in bidirectional charging. So, also, the feedback that we're getting on the Blazer EV is outstanding as well. So, those are just two examples. It's also the fact that we'll be well into the scale of the battery cells at that point in time. And I already mentioned how much the cost has come down just from having one module to virtually having, by the end of the year, on plan, we'll have the Lordstown plant fully ramped. And then we're on track for the other plant. So, getting the Ultium battery cells scaled will be another important piece. I talked about, last time, what we're doing with winning with simplicity. And really honing in and going to market in a simpler way that, frankly, we think is better for the consumer because they're not overwhelmed with the number of choices they need to make. And taking that kind of order complexity and build combination complexity out drops a tremendous amount of cost to the bottom line from designing it, engineering it, sourcing it, and planning for it to get [lineside] (ph). And then we've seen product improvements. With the Ultium, it was our first generation. We learned a lot from the Bolt that went into how we designed this first round of Ultium product, but we're already seeing improvements we can make in Ultium, and then improvements we can make beyond the EV platform in these vehicles that will make them more efficient. And it's appropriate application of things like [giga-castings] (ph), which is already on the C8. We learned a lot on the CT6. It will be a part of CELESTIQ. And there's other vehicles that we haven't announced yet that it will be an important part of. So, it's, frankly, looking at fundamentally everything. But we remain committed to get there. And, frankly, where lithium prices are trending is another enabler. Itay Michaeli : That's all very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, maybe wanted to touch upon Cruise, with Cruise really scaling now to multiple cities and making a lot of progress, any just thoughts on funding going forward, as well as any strategic thoughts you can share as Cruise goes into the next stage of growth? Mary Barra : Well, we're going to have a lot more to say about Cruise in the latter part of this year. Paul will be at a Barclays Conference. We also will have fourth quarter earnings, and then our Investor Day. So, we do believe that Cruise has tremendous opportunity to grow and expand. Safety will be our gating factor as we do that, and continuing to work with the cities that we're deploying in. So, we'll have more to say about that at a later date. But rest assured we do have funding plans that will support Cruise's expansion. Itay Michaeli : Perfect, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to follow up again on the Ultium strategy and some of these changes here. How flexible are you finding that program is to be able to make these changes? And are some of these learnings you talked about that you plan to implement on Silverado also scalable to the other products or should we think that -- basically, should we think about there being a need for like an Ultium 2.0 platform in the couple of years versus what we're seeing today in the market? Mary Barra : As we've already said, the Ultium platform is chemistry-agnostic. And so, we will continue to look to make programs. And as we go forward, we will adapt. There'll be, I think, Ultium 2.0 as we get into the latter part of this decade, as well as many other parts of the vehicle. Again, I think it's hard to really explain without being in person. And we'll do this when we're together at our Investor Day, of the simplification that we can do to the vehicles that makes them easier to build. And, frankly, the mindset change we've had from a complexity perspective is pretty significant. So, again it's yes, there's going to be improvements. We'll continue to drive efficiencies in the Ultium platform. But it's also, broadly, across the entire vehicle. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then, Mary, on the -- there was a comment about the Ohio battery JV being able to be at full capacity by the end of this year. I think that's like 35 gigawatt-hours if I recall correctly. So, how does that JV, which I know you're only part owner, plan to balance that with GM's own EV demand? Is there going to be a continued ramp there and produce, and maybe build some stock or look for additional offtake? And also, does this revised EV timeline impact any of the other battery JVs coming online? Mary Barra : No, we plan on having the ramp at Lordstown will continue as it is. And the plant in Spring Hill comes online next year. And then we have plant three in Michigan that follows, and then the work with Samsung. We'll keep all of those on track because we believe strongly that we need those cells. Now, obviously, if we have to evaluate and slow something down, but at this time we don't see a need to do that with the plans that we've outlined here. Joseph Spak : Okay, thank you. Mary Barra : Hey, Joe, just on that, again, I want to reiterate. We're going to respond to demand. And we're going to make sure we have the right products at the right time, but we're not overbuilding. Joseph Spak : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning everybody. Mary and Paul, when you think about the capital commitment that's going on in the business lobby, it's always very large, but with EVs and things that are shifting on technology and products, product plans, it seems a little bit more uncertain, a little bit more dynamic, and it has historically. Do you think about returns on capital as we shift into this EV world? Can they potentially be higher and shorter-dated? So, they give you more flexibility to make changes like you just did with the vault, or are we still thinking about sort of seven to 10 year decisions like we did on the ICE side? I think there's a lot of folks that think this is a real risk, but it sounds like it also might be an opportunity to be more flexible? Paul Jacobson : Yes, good morning John. Paul, I think that's what we're aiming to and I think creating the foundation of reducing complexity and buildable combinations and more simpler engineering design manufacturing, I think is going to give us that agility going forward. I think the other thing that you're going to see us, and I think the Orion announcement is a good example of this, is we're also engineering improvements on the fly. So, I think if you look at the historical record, it would be you produce a vehicle, you would identify some improvements in customer features, profitability, et cetera and you'd wait for a mid-cycle model improvement to actually go in and implement those changes. It's really more of a mindset that's, I would say more conducive to software that says, here's an opportunity to really improve the profitability, the capability of the vehicle, let's go ahead and put it in line. So, the Orion decision represents an early application of that where we've seen a slowing in the demand growth create the opportunity to go in and build these from the ground up as we expand and scale up. And I think it's going to make us more nimble in the future and ultimately lead to more consistent ROIC. John Murphy : And then just one follow-up on the strength in sales year-to-date, the U.S. market really seems to be buoyed by fleet sales more than retail at the moment and you guys usually have a better line of sight and visibility into orders from your fleet customers. So, one, if you can confirm that strength has really been driven by fleet relative to expectations at the beginning of the year. And two, is there visibility that this is going to last kind of like it did in '10, '11, and '12 sort of as a consistent driver of the upside of the cycle early in the cyclical recovery? Paul Jacobson : Well, I think, John, we've been consistently talking about pent-up demand from the last couple of years, and that's been really evident in the fleet customers. But I would say that the retail share gains and the performance of the retail customer has been strong as well. In fact, we've seen gains in market share pretty consistently this year, both from fleet and from retail, while we've increased production, while we have kept incentives down, and while we have reduced marketing spend. So, I think it's a real testament, especially to the North America team for what they've performed through and what they've done in the face of that strength. And while we hear reports out there in the macro that consumer sentiment might be weakening, et cetera, we haven't seen that in demand for our vehicles, and we've been pretty consistent about that on the retail side as well. So, we're continuing to enjoy that, and I think we're operating from a much more disciplined lens around margin improvement as a result of what we've seen in that transformation. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. Good morning. First, a couple of clarifications on the 2025 targets for the EV business, so, low to mid-single-digits margin. I think when you initiated that guidance, this was excluding the IRA sale manufacturing credit, but I think including them, you could have gone to mid to high single-digits. Is that still very much the case, or are you saying that now including IRA, you would be at the low to mid-single-digits? And then on the volume piece, or I guess the capacity piece, to the extent that your capacity is flexible between EVs and ICE, would you consider reducing the 2025 EV capacity target in the future of the industry dynamics or demand that was weaker than expected? Mary Barra : Well, first on the first question, we remain committed to low single-digit margins IRA. Nothing has changed there. And so, as you said it would be similar to ICE like margins with what we believe we know the IRA to be. We still are waiting for final clarification from Treasury on a couple aspects of that. And then, again, as Paul outlined, with the flexibility we have in Ramos, with the flexibility that we have in Spring Hill and our plants, I don't think it's that we'll adjust down the amount of capacity that we'll have. It's just that we're going to be able to respond very quickly to EV or AV depending on where the customer is and what they demand. So, I think we're going to need the capacity and again the flexibility that we have is I think going to be one of the ways that GM is going to be better positioned to serve the market for both ICE and EV as we move in this transition period. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess more broadly for the overall business, just clarifying your net cost reduction target of $2 billion. This is, I assume this is before any labor cost inflation expected from the new contract. But can you please clarify this? And assuming that this does not include that inflation in the net reduction, what sort of actions are you contemplating to try and offset that labor cost inflation? What could be done above and beyond the $2 billion to offset any additional cost increase? Paul Jacobson : So, good morning, Emmanuel. It's Paul. What I would say is that the $2 billion is around controllable fixed costs and we remain committed to being able to do that. The implications of the UAW contract when it is agreed to and ratified will flow significantly and largely through cost of goods sold in our margin performance. So, when you look at the ways that we have to offset that, those are things that affect the EV profitability, et cetera going forward. So, what we've got to do is make sure that number one, we sign a contract that we know we can compete in the global marketplace because we want to make sure that these are good jobs and they are good jobs for the next people as well that are going to taking over. We are protecting the brand, the company, the franchise, and the future. So, we are going to have to look at potentially reducing fixed costs further. We are going to have to look at efficiencies across the board in engineering and designing the vehicles. And that's a little bit of trying to get ahead of some of those inflationary pressures that we saw with the steps that we have taken earlier this year. So, we are going to continue to look at doing that. And we've got some work cut out for us, but we are committed to making it work. Emmanuel Rosner : Great, thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Jonas : Hi, good morning. Mary, you've acknowledged for some time that the General Motors share price is not really getting any credit for the cruise business. I think many would argue that at $29 a stock might even be implying a negative value for cruise, which I think you'd reckon would be pretty ridiculous. So, my question is, besides continuing on growing and executing on the business, I know we're going to learn a lot in the next year. Is there anything else that your management team or board could possibly do to unlock value for the cruise business? Mary Barra : Adam, first of all, I completely agree with you. I think the stock is undervalued. Even if it was just an ICE EV and software company, I think the cruise piece of it is further. I think as we continue to expand cruise in a very thoughtful way, focused on safety, I think people will see and start to unlock. I mean, just last week we announced the opportunity that we have with Honda and Cruise and General Motors in Japan. And so, to be able to be involved in driving expansion, not just in the United States, but globally, I think it's going to be an important part of Cruise's mid to longer-term future of success. So, we do believe in the technology. As I said in my remarks, it is safer than a human driver and is constantly improving and getting better. And that's what we're focused on doing. Adam Jonas : It's really amazing to see the growth in San Francisco. I know people that use it every day. Just a follow-up for Paul, you guys have been very specific, I think within a range at least of a 2025 EV target of the mid to high single digit without IRA. You're obviously not disclosing where EV margins are today. So, I'm not going to press you on that because you would have disclosed it. You're choosing not to. But I think in some of your comments, if I heard you correctly, Paul, you said you're not doing it today because of the labor situation or you know until you get the clearer picture on labor but when we get through this standoff with the UAW, can we expect that you will be specific of what the starting point is in the next year? So, we could understand the delta from how loss-making the EVs are today clearly they're loss making but had to put a number on it, so that investors can have greater transparency the delta. Is that something you can commit to please? Paul Jacobson : Yes, good morning, Adam. First of all just to clarify in your comments the target is low to mid-single-digits ex-IRA. I think you said mid to high in your question. I just want to correct that for the record. But yes clearly look as we said repeatedly this year the margins in EVs are just relatively nonsensical mainly because we've got a big scaled infrastructure with limited production across the board. So, we are absolutely committed to presenting that roadmap and we'll do that at our Investor Day and the decision to push out Investor Day was really we've got a lot of good strategic data points to put out there. We want to make sure that it wasn't something that was dominated by the UAW. So, when the weather gets a little bit warmer in Charlotte in March, we'll have that Investor Day. We'll provide that roadmap including kind of where we've come from and where we're going to get to that low to mid-single-digit margin target, and we're making good progress internally. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Absolutely. Thanks for your question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hi, good morning everyone. I'm curious to get your thoughts on incentive spending for the fourth quarter and just the overall pricing backdrop in North America, I mean obviously we have there are production limitations type of strike right now. But just how are U.S. inventory data supply trending, today relative to quarter-end and just any color there would be great. Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes, good morning, James. So, in terms of incentive strategy, like I said in my prepared remarks, I think the team deserves a lot of credit for really transforming the approach and the go-to-market strategies, not just around incentives, but how we market the vehicles and really across the board that has been a huge contributor to some of the profitability that we've had on the backs of the strength and the consumers and the products that we're producing across the board. So, I expect that strategy to continue. Certainly as we looked at quarter-end, inventories had trended a little bit higher, and of course this varies on a product-by-product basis. And we're watching that very closely in partnership with our dealers to try to make sure in light of the work stoppage that we are getting vehicles to market where we have them. So, we're going to continue to manage that very tactically across the board, but everything that we're seeing in the demand set right now is pretty strong for our vehicles, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the year. James Picariello : Okay, that's helpful. And then, my follow-up, can you just confirm the materials and freight impact in the quarter and just at a high level as we think about next year based on current commodity spot pricing, any visibility you might have in supplier costs, just how we can think about this cost bucket for 2024? I believe the 2023 guide, the prior 2023 reflect for an expectation of neutral, any color there would be great. Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes, it's a little early to get into that. We're in the midst of our budget process right now, but what I would say is we have seen some logistics and delivery pressure that we've talked about before, particularly with vehicles coming into North America from Mexico with rail challenges, et cetera. So, I expect there will be parts where there's some inflationary pressure, but as we've said over the last couple of years, the amount that we spend on expedited logistics, et cetera has been coming down as the chip shortage and some of the supply chain shortages have been tempered from the peaks in 2021 and 2022. I will say that there's a bit of concern on my mind in terms of the supply chain's ability to ramp up after the work stoppage. Obviously, we're focused on getting this finalized as quickly as we can. But it's important that we don't end up in a situation where we can't ramp up to full production because the supply chain has to rebuild, et cetera. So, we're watching that closely and making sure that we're in a position, but more to come on 2024 as we work through that and work through the budget. James Picariello : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start first with just a question on the volume versus price mix interplay. Pre-COVID, you were at, call it -- anywhere from 3.2 million to 3.6 million units of annual volume. And this year on some of the consensus numbers, strike aside, will be closer to call it, 3 million units. Now you're absorbing more in the way of labor costs. I think we're waiting to see what happens with EVs, but most would view EVs to be a cost challenge. So, you've already done a really good job showing us the benefits of mix and pivoting to profitable units. I think that was something you alluded to in your prepared remarks and really a business that in a way, shown slight pivots away from volume. How much more do you think the business can focus more on mix and profitable units and relatively reduced focus on volume? Mary Barra : Well, Dan, I appreciate the question. We really want to focus on both, but it's got to be profitable growth. When you look at the EVs and even our ICE vehicles, I just mentioned that the Trax 50% of the customers for the new Trax are new to General Motors. So, from an EV's point specifically, we think that along the coast where EV adoption is higher, that's going to be a growth opportunity for us over the next several years. And we're going to just focus on continuing to have winning ICE and winning EV products that people want to buy. And so, I don't I felt like your question is saying, are you just going to shrink? And the answer is no. That's not our intent. Our intent is to be profitable and then grow and expand, and we think we have the opportunity to do that. Paul Jacobson : And Dan, I think I'll add that, I think the challenges of the last few years, I think have taught us a lot about ourselves and about the quality of our products. And it all starts with that when you create products that customers love. You have an opportunity to think about the business. So, while the profitability and the margins have gone up. We've been really focused on that. But some examples of that are what we're doing with buildable combinations, what we've been doing with marketing spend, et cetera, it's really focused on driving at the unit level, the margin improvement across the board. So, focusing on those premium mixes where we know the demand is focusing on the premium vehicles where there's supply constraints. Those are lessons that we can take into the future going forward and are going to help us not just with ICE profitability and margins, but also help pave the way for an EV strategy that is really focused on consistent margin performance going forward. So, incredibly proud of what the organization has done, and certainly think there's more to come. Now we've been doing all of this in a lower SAAR environment and feel really good about our ability to continue that should we get back to more historical normal levels at higher volumes across the board. So, I think it's been good lessons learned, and you never let a good crisis go to waste. And I think that's where we've seen some really good long-term permanent learnings for the organization. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. And then, second question, I wanted to just go into the dynamics behind the battery plants. Thank you for the commentary earlier that you're starting to run at capacity on Lordstown. Spring Hill that sounds like that's a slight delay. I think that was just the launch this year staying at 2024. Lansing is after that. Maybe you could just give us a sense on where the other two battery plants stand? And to what extent is the gating factor more on supply versus more so listening to the near-term demand. And if you need to, you can delay some investment to ramp on the other two battery plants? Mary Barra : So, as I mentioned before, we will have the Lordstown plant up full capacity at the end of this year, which then allows for it to have a full-year next year. The Spring Hill plant will start early next year. There was a couple of weeks, it was supposed to originally start at the end of this year. There was a couple of weeks due to some construction delays but it now is on track, and it will ramp with all the benefit of the learnings. And we fully believe we're going to need all the cells from both of those plants. And then, when you get to the Michigan plant, again, we think that there's going to be demand there as we continue to though be agile and resilient and build to where customer demand is, we can obviously make some changes there. But right now the cadence I talked about is when those plants start and that the fourth plant will be likely very early '26 having good, good progress with Samsung. So, we're not slowing the ramp of the battery plants down at all. I think as you know, battery cells are the constraint of the industry. And so, we're going to -- we think we're going to need all of those even with this ramp change that we've made with Orion and some of the other programs I mentioned it's just -- it's a couple months in most cases. Dan Levy : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. The UAW made a big announcement -- big deal about the concessions at the battery plant. Just wondering if you have any color there because I was a bit surprised because that's in a joint venture, so I wasn't sure how you actually could give concessions. Any color on what the nature of that agreement is and how you're able to kind of come to terms with them there? Mary Barra : Right now the Ultium team that is a separate company is negotiating, that the employees at Lordstown voted to unionize, and so that local leadership team is negotiating with the UAW to have their own agreement. We did have some conversations and we did put an offer on the table that would put the Ultium cells under the scope of the master agreement and we believed at the time that it would allow for which it must have benchmark economics and also operating flexibility because the battery cell plant is very different than some of the traditional operations we won right now, but at this point that offer remains open, but the focus is on Ultium getting their own agreement. Colin Langan : Got it. Just we're still in early days at EVs. There seems like demand is eased already and it's great that you have the flexibility to kind of switch between EV and ICE, but the regulations in the U.S. kind of push easy at least at some point in the future, do you think there's any change in the tone of Washington of potentially pushing out some of those targets, doesn't it become a bit of a challenge of consumers aren't interested in buying EVs and you're just the only way to sell them would be to hit your margins, right? Mary Barra : Yes. I mean, obviously, we provide regular input into the administration and the regulatory agencies. I've been very clear and on the record that the regulations can't get in front of EV demand at some of which is will be enabled by having a robust charging infrastructure. So, we regularly have those conversations, and we'll do what it takes to meet the regulatory environment as well. Colin Langan : Got it. All right, thanks for taking my questions. Mary Barra : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. I very much appreciate the plan to be flexible on the cadence of the EV ramp and the opportunity for GM to implement some incremental cost reductions, but given that scale was one of the key inputs in EV profits, can you just better understand if there is a certain minimum amount of volume that you may need to be yet in order to reach your load to mid-single-digit EV margin target in 2025? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Good morning, Mark. So, what I would say is it's a little bit of a step function, right? So, as we build a plant or transform a plant, we've got to fill that up to maximize efficiency, so the decision to defer Orion is really an example of not rushing to build that full infrastructure before we know that we can fill it up. So, ultimately it leads to more of an efficient transition. So, what I would say is we've got good capacity at the facilities that we've already transformed and we're working to scale those to that capacity as quickly as we can. So, it remains a big part of it but I think you're going to see a little bit of step changes through the transformation as we bring that incremental capacity online, but that's part of our plans, it's all rolled into the targets that we've outlined on our ability to hit the load of mid-single-digit margins on EVs in 2025 and then grow from there. Mark Delaney : Thanks for that Paul. And then, on the international business, the company was profitable including in China, despite what's been a difficult market backdrop. Can you speak in more detail on how you think the international market will progress from here? Thanks. Mary Barra : Well, if we first start with the GMI market X China, again, we see a really strong improvement across all of the countries that we're in from South America to the Middle East to Korea et cetera. We're going to continue to focus on and the -- one again it's operating disciple. It's also having the right products for those markets and understanding in some cases especially in markets like South America where we price for what's happening from a current foreign currency exchange perspective. And we are seeing the products because of the strength of them hold up. So, very pleased with where the GMI markets are. And as you focus on China, China is still -- we are looking for potentially a modest recovery continuing into Q4. But the real focus for General Motors in China is to make sure we get our Ultium products out there from a Buick and a Cadillac perspective. And then, also focus on the right products from an SGM Wuling perspective. And then, remember we are also expanding for premium import. And we think those three initiatives are going to position us well even in uncertain market that we are facing in China that gives us a lot of optionality at the -- I'll say the entry level on value part of the market, the mid part of the market, and then at the top part of the market. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to -- back to Mary Barra for closing comments. Mary Barra : Great. Well, thank you, Amanda. And thanks everybody for joining the call today. It's clear that we are dealing with a lot of near-term uncertainty. And then, also the -- I'll say the transition that -- to EVs that will have ups and downs. But I hope it's equally clear that we are going to be acting with purpose. We are going to remain agile. And we are making sure we have a system that has the ability to respond to where the market is. And our commitment is to deliver a strong and profitable ICE business as well as a strong and profitable EV business for our future. In addition, I think if you look deeper into the organization that Mike Abbott has built from a software perspective, this is really foundational for us to be able to capture additional revenue with a very different margin profile than some of the aspects of the vehicle and the business that we have today. And then, finally, we see tremendous opportunity with Cruise. And we'll continue to work across not only this country working with our regulators to make sure we can deploy Cruise safely. I know the UAW contract is one of the biggest sources of uncertainty right now. But I want to remind you with what I said earlier, we will not agree to a contract that isn't responsible for our employees and for our shareholders. We need to make sure we have a contract that is going to allow us to compete and win in what is a challenging market for EVs and also allows us to support the business that we have with strong margins in our ICE business. When we do reach an agreement, we will schedule an event shortly thereafter to discuss the economics and our strategy for managing them. And as Paul said, we will host our next Investor Day in March to go even deeper into the ICE, EV, AV, and specifically our software plans. When you look at our growth businesses especially Cruise and software, we are at an inflection point right now. And see tremendous upside opportunity and growth. And so, we look forward to discussing each of them with you in more detail as we move forward. So, make no mistake, GM is very committed to all EV future. We are not changing any of our goals there. We are just trying to make sure the company is more agile and resilient so that we can be successful as we manage this transformation. So, want to thank you again for joining us. Thanks for your questions. And I hope everyone has a good day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

During the open remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the open remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, January 30, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thank you, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2023. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the Safe Harbor Statements on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. As we begin 2024, I believe GM is well positioned for a year of strong financial performance that builds on everything we accomplished and importantly learned in 2023. Consensus is growing that the US economy, the job market, and auto sales will continue to be resilient. At GM we expect healthy industry sales of about 16 million units. We have an unmatched ICE portfolio in North America, rising EV production on the LTM platform and GM Financial continues to perform well. We're building on a foundation of products that our customers love. In 2023, GM sold more vehicles in the US than anyone else. All of our US brands grew their sales year-over-year and gained US market share with healthy margins, thanks to stable pricing and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. The Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV had record sales. We led the industry in initial quality for the second year in a row according to J.D. Power. And we now have led the industry in combined pickup, full-size van, and full-size SUV sales for 10 consecutive years, making us the leader in the highest ATP quadrant of the market and helping us lead the commercial fleet market. And we have passed Honda and Toyota in the most affordable quadrant, thanks to attractive and profitable vehicles like the Chevrolet Trax, which is one of Car and Driver's 10 best trucks and SUVs, and the Buick Envista, which is winning with younger buyers. In fact, more than one in four Envista customers are between the ages of 18 and 35. The broad-based momentum we have today is important for our future because our customers are the most loyal in the industry. All of this success contributed to full year EBIT-adjusted of $12.4 billion and adjusted auto-free cash flow of $11.7 billion in 2023, which brings our total to more than $22 billion for 2022 and 2023. Almost two-thirds of that cash is being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in November. Through the ASR, we immediately retired 215 million common shares in the fourth quarter. Our current share count is less than 1.2 billion and we are working to reduce this even further to less than 1 billion common shares outstanding, which would be about 600 million fewer than at our peak. As we look ahead, our priorities and our commitments are clear. They are to maximize the opportunities we have with our winning ICE portfolio, grow our EV business profitably, deliver strong margins and cash flow, and refocus and relaunch crews. Across the enterprise, we are taking important steps to deliver on each priority. Let's start with our ICE portfolio. Chevrolet's crossover lineup had record sales last year, and this year we're enhancing two of its most important models which compete in growing segments. For example, Super Cruise will be available on the Traverse for the first time and we will introduce a new premium Z71 off-road model. The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox that we unveiled last week is another great example. It has more standard safety equipment, new truck-inspired styling, and a strong focus on technology. And importantly, both the Traverse and Equinox will have higher projected margins than the outgoing model. Buick and GMC are also launching new crossovers this year to keep our momentum going. In our EV business, we expect our US portfolio to be variable profit positive in the second half of the year based on our current expectations for EV demand and production growth. Strong interest in our vehicles, lower commodity prices and other factors will support this. Our plan is to produce in wholesale 200,000 to 300,000 Altium-based Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and BrightDrop EVs in North America this year, but we will be guided by customer demand. It's true, the pace of EV growth has slowed, which has created some uncertainty. We will build to demand and we are encouraged that many third party forecasts have US EV deliveries rising from about 7% of the industry in 2023 to at least 10% in 2024, which would mean another year of record EV sales. We believe our competitive position will improve throughout the year based on higher production of the Cadillac LYRIQ, the GMC Hummer EV, the Chevrolet Blazer EV, and the Silverado EV work truck. We're also excited to have the Chevrolet Equinox EV and the Silverado EV RST, the GMC Sierra EV Denali, and the Cadillac Escalade IQ arriving in showrooms over the course of the year. We are confident in the design and performance of these vehicles. For example, the LYRIQ is driving growth at Cadillac. Its sales have increased sequentially every month since September and January deliveries should be in line with December despite winter storms across the country. We also have more than 10,000 -- excuse me, 100,000 reservations and orders for EV pickups that we expect to fulfill in 2024 and 2025. However, if demand conditions change, we'll take advantage of our manufacturing flexibility in Spring Hill and Ramos to build more ICE models and fewer EVs. We can also mix between different EV products at Factory ZERO. Ultimately, we will follow the customer. The supply chain, manufacturing, and software changes we have made will support our growth. On the battery front, our Ultium Cells joint venture is at full production in Ohio, and the new plant in Tennessee will begin shipping cells this quarter. In addition, our supply chain team has moved very quickly to resource two minor cell components after the US Treasury published its updated IRA guidelines in December. This change means that new production going forward of the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ will qualify for the full $7,500 consumer credit. We work closely with our dealers to ensure consistent pricing for our customers, which we estimate will impact no more than about 25,000 vehicles. Our battery module production is on schedule. The team has improved the automated equipment at our assembly plant used to build modules and installation of new high capacity assembly lines should be complete by mid-year. Our software and services team is also in the process of resolving the stability issues some customers have experienced with the Chevrolet Blazer EV that impacted their screens and charging experience. And they are working with a huge sense of urgency to lift the stop sales soon. We disappointed these customers and we know it. We are determined to get the software right and we will. We have made several organizational and process improvements that will help us deliver the best possible customer experience going forward. Among several important organizational realignments, we established a software quality division within the software and services team that has been performing a retrospective on the Blazer EV and has improved the current software development and test processes across the enterprise. Outcomes of this activity are getting applied to all programs going forward and they include improved standardization of the software development and release process, increased focus on test automation at the vehicle level, and additional quality gates and metrics for software at the vehicle level. From a margin and cash flow perspective, we are making good progress on cost reduction and capital efficiency. Compared with 2022, our fixed cost net of depreciation and amortization will be down $2 billion as we exit 2024, which will offset the higher impact -- the impact of higher labor costs. We are also beginning to see savings from winning with simplicity, and all of our current and future programs have embraced this very important way of designing products. Each team is responsible for creating trim series that make vehicles easy to order with the content customers want and far fewer standalone options. By making more equipment standard in trim series with logical price swaps, we can eliminate literally thousands of unique part numbers and dozens of software releases. For example, we have eliminated over 1,000 selectable options across our current and near-term product programs, which is reducing hardware, software, ordering and manufacturing complexity, and importantly, all the costs associated with them. In 2024, the savings are expected to be about $200 million. To be clear, we're talking about $200 million of savings to execute the same product plan. These savings will grow over time as we apply the discipline to future products like our next generation full-size pickups. We're also continuing to balance capital priorities and consistent free cash flow generation. We expect that our 2024 capital spending will be in the $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion, which is roughly flat year-over-year and down considerably from the $13 billion top of our end initial 2023 guidance. Our forward plans include bringing our plug-in hybrid technology to select vehicles in North America. Let me be clear, GM remains committed to eliminating tailpipe emissions from our light duty vehicles by 2035. But in the interim, deploying plug-in technology in strategic segments will deliver some of the environmental benefits of EVs as the nation continues to build its charging infrastructure. We are timing the launches to help us comply with the more stringent fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards that are being proposed. And we plan to deliver the program in a capital and cost-efficient way because the technology is already in production in other markets. We'll have more to share about this down the road. Moving to Cruise. Last week we released the results of the third-party reviews and we've already begun to implement significant changes to build a better Cruise. We are committed to earning back the trust with our regulators and the public through our actions. Our plan 2024 investment in Cruise reflects our more deliberate and cadence go-to-market strategy and we are developing new financial targets and a new roadmap. Spending will be down considerably this year, but we will continue to invest in the people who are advancing the software, specialized hardware, and AI capabilities. This reflects our commitment to our vision, which is to deliver the safety benefits of self-driving technology and a scalable, profitable business. I look forward to sharing our timetable for returning Cruise EVs to the road soon. To summarize, we learned a lot in 2023, and those learnings are helping us build our strengths and addressing our challenges. Everyone on the team is committed to building on our momentum and creating shareholding value. You'll see in our proxy statement this spring, executive compensation is tied even more closely to delivering our comprehensive ICE, EV, AV, and software plans, while meeting our financial targets. So our goals are truly aligned with yours. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I would like to share some thoughts about our next Investor Day. Because of the significant changes that are underway at GM and Cruise, we think it makes sense to wait until later in the year to host an event. This will give our software team the time to focus on software for our upcoming launches, and we will be able to share more tangible proof points on all four pillars of our strategy, ICE, EV, AV, and software. When we do get together, we will show you what we've done, not just tell you what we're going to do. In the meantime, we've already provided a roadmap for EV profitability in 2025, and we'll share updates on Cruise as we finalize the technology and relaunch plans. With that, I'll turn it over to Paul to go through our 2023 financials and provide more details on our 2024 outlook. Then we'll take your questions. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'd like to begin by recognizing the entire GM team for what they accomplished in 2023. When you look back over the last couple of years, the results show an impressive trend in revenue growth, EPS consistency, and cash generation. For the full year, our EBIT-adjusted of $12.4 billion came in slightly above the midpoint of the range we guided to in November, thanks to the continued strength of the core business. We grew revenue by 10% year-over-year to a record $172 billion and generated $7.68 of EPS diluted adjustments. A key focus has been profitable growth. And for the full year, we demonstrated this by growing U.S. market share by 30 basis points, while keeping incentives well below industry averages. It's important to mention the 2023 actions we've taken to reduce fixed costs and the progress made on the $2 billion net cost reduction program. For example, automotive engineering was reduced by $400 million, driven by portfolio simplification, realizing the benefits from winning with simplicity as well as our drive to virtual engineering. Marketing spend was reduced by $500 million and we expect another $400 million this year. And we saw approximately $500 million from lower BrightDrop and other growth business spend, along with the impact of the voluntary separation program across the enterprise. These $1.4 billion of fixed cost reductions were partially offset by $400 million of higher depreciation and amortization, meeting our target to achieve half of the $2 billion program in 2023. We began 2023 with $24 billion of auto cash and marketable securities, generated full year adjusted auto-free cash flow of $11.7 billion, and returned approximately $12 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, including the impact of the $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program initiated in Q4. Coming into 2024, we are well positioned with roughly $20 billion of auto cash and marketable securities and will appropriately balance our capital allocation priorities with the plan to continue to return capital to our shareholder through repurchases and our new higher dividend rate. Let's get into Q4 results. Total company revenue was $43 billion, consistent year-over-year, despite the impact of the strike. However, we did have a number of cost items that we do not expect to reoccur in 2024 that impacted our margin performance in the quarter. We achieved $1.8 billion in EBIT adjusted, 4.1% EBIT adjusted margins, and $1.24 in EPS diluted adjusted. These results were also impacted by the strike, which had a $900 million EBIT adjusted impact in Q4 and a $1.1 billion impact for the full year, primarily from losing an estimated 95,000 units of production. Additionally, we increased our inventory valuation allowances by $1.1 billion to remeasure battery cell and EV inventory held at year end. This adjustment was significantly larger in Q4 versus prior quarters, driven by a combination of increasing cell production in preparation for our 2024 EV acceleration and holding more EVs in company inventory. Adjustments for the full year totaled $1.7 billion. We expect this to be substantially lower in 2024 as we continue to make progress toward our EBIT margin targets on EVs. North America delivered Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $2 billion, down $1.6 billion year-over-year, driven primarily by the $900 million strike impact and $1 billion of inventory adjustments I just discussed. The performance was also driven by higher pricing and lower fixed costs, which more than offset mixed headwinds. North America margin of 8.7% was within our targeted 8% to 10% range for the full year and included a 1.6 percentage point impact from the strike and the inventory adjustments. Part of this performance is from proactively managing our inventory levels, helping to minimize incentives. I'm pleased that we ended the year at 50 days of U.S. inventory, which is at the low end of our 50 to 60 day target range, and incentives that were more than 20% below the industry average. GM International had another solid quarter with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $300 million, which was consistent year-over-year. I want to thank the entire international team for another year of good execution and delivering $1.2 billion of EBIT adjusted. GM Financial also performed well with Q4 EBIT-adjusted of $700 million. down slightly year-over-year. Full year results were $3 billion at the top end of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. Portfolio credit metrics continue to be strong, in part due to a predominantly prime credit mix with net charge off up slightly due to moderation in credit performance. GM financial has consistently been an integral part of the business supporting our customers, supporting our dealers and paying dividends of $1.8 billion to GM in 2023. Cruise expenses were $800 million in the quarter, up $300 million year-over-year and similar to the spend level in Q3. So let's look ahead to 2024. We expect EBIT-adjusted in the $12 billion to $14 billion range. EPS diluted adjusted to be in the $8.50 to $9.50 range, including an estimated $1.45 per share benefit from last year's accelerated share repurchase based on the current share price, which will be partially offset by roughly $0.50 headwind from a higher tax rate and lower interest income on lower cash balances, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8 billion, $10 billion range for the year. I want to summarize a few items in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat and will help to contribute to our higher outlook for this year despite some of the potential macro headwinds. These include the $800 million EBIT-adjusted impact from the LG agreements. And as a reminder, this will save us an additional $1,000 per vehicle going forward on our path to EV profitability. $1.1 billion EBIT adjusted impact from the strike and a substantial amount of the $1.7 billion of net realizable value adjustments as we work through the sell inventory, improve EV profitability, and benefit from lower lithium prices. In light of the current macro environment, we anticipate a market similar to 2023 with total US industry volumes of around 16 million units. We expect wholesale volume to grow as we rebound from the impact of the strike and continue our track record of market share gains, primarily from higher EV volumes. However, we do assume mixed headwinds from our ICE production driven by anticipated actions to proactively manage full size truck inventory levels. We also assume a 2% to 2.5% pricing headwind year-over-year, but overall we remain confident in our ability to balance production, inventory levels and profitability, while growing revenues and sustain our North America margins in the 8% to 10% range. We are on track to realize the remaining $1 billion of net fixed cost savings with the benefits coming from similar areas to last year, including marketing, engineering, and the full year benefit of the actions we took in 2023. We expect $1.3 billion in higher labor costs, along with logistics being a slight headwind year-over-year, primarily driven by higher finished vehicle shipping costs. Cruise expenses are expected to be around $1 billion lower, given the new operational plan Mary mentioned earlier. In November we gave an update on our path to EV profitability with an estimated EBIT margin improvement of more than 60 percentage points and a lower overall EV loss in 2024 compared to 2023, even when you exclude the impact of the inventory adjustments. This will largely be driven by higher EV volumes and fixed cost leverage from both EV and battery cell manufacturing, along with the benefit of all of our North America volume being on the Ultium platform. We are already seeing an improvement in cell cost today, driven by significantly lower raw materials prices and better pricing on cells produced at our first battery JV plant from higher capacity utilization. For GM International, we expect relative stability in our South America and Middle East operations, however, we anticipate ongoing pressure in China, including the plan to reduce production in Q1 to balance dealer inventory levels. These actions will likely result in Q1 China equity income being a slight loss, with a return to profitability starting in Q2. For GM Financial, we expect EBIT-adjusted again in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range with credit performance and used vehicle prices returning to normal throughout the year, along with earning asset growth from retail loan originations and the commercial loan portfolio. We are forecasting another year of robust automotive adjusted free cash flow, but we anticipate modest year-over-year headwinds from 2023 working capital benefits that we assume will not repeat and the timing of payments associated with accruals recognized last year. For example, warranty, tax, and higher assumed inventory levels. From a modeling perspective, remember that Q1 is our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter of the year. We expect our capital spend to be similar to 2023, inclusive of $500 million to $1 billion of investments in our battery JVs. Our 2024 effective tax rate is assumed to be in the range of 18% to 20%, up from last year, primarily due to the global mix of earnings and lower R&D credits primarily due to lower Cruise spend. And our full year EPS guidance assumes the weighted-average fully diluted share count of slightly below 1.15 billion shares. This includes the impact of the remaining shares to be purchased through the ASR, which we expect will reduce our fully diluted share count to below 1.1 billion shares once completed. The actual share count will depend on several factors that impact the final ASR settlement, including the average share price during execution and excludes the impact of any incremental share repurchases beyond the ASR. In closing, we know the EV market is not going to grow linearly and we are prepared to flex between ICE and EV production, given our unique manufacturing capabilities to balance inventory levels and to build customer demand. This will help support pricing and our continued incentive discipline. While we have faced some challenges in our EV transition, we are actively working to address them and remain excited about our future and look forward to a successful 2024. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody and congratulations. Just a couple questions on the outlook. First, maybe can you share what you're assuming for end of year US dealer inventory day supply. And in all the pricing, Paul, you mentioned 2%, 2.5%. can you maybe talk a bit of what you're assuming per individual segments there? Paul Jacobson : Yes, good morning, Itay, and thanks for your comments and your questions. First on the inventory question, what I would say is, we're continuing to pursue our targeted range of 50 to 60 days on hand of inventory. I think the team has done a really good job of balancing that, and I think that's provided some of the ability to be disciplined with incentives, and clearly is, I think, resulted in a competitive advantage for us that we've utilized for the last couple of years. As we think about that 2% to 2.5%, similar to what we've done for the last couple of years, I would call that a planning assumption rather than an expectation of where we see pricing. We want to make sure that we do that to make sure -- to ensure that we can hit our targets, generate the cash flow that's needed for investment and drive the free cash flow performance. So, as similar to years past, if we don't see that, I would expect that we can get some upside into the numbers that we've talked about. So, we haven't gone through and assigned an expectation to any particular categories that's just something top-sided we do in the planning process. I hope that helps. Itay Michaeli : It does help. Thank you. And a quick follow-up, on the second half target on EV positive VP per unit, can you just talk about what you're assuming for the broader competitive environment and how much cushion you have on the price mix side and still be able to hit those targets? Paul Jacobson : So without getting into very detailed specifics, because, obviously, it can get quite complicated. What I would say is, we feel confident about hitting that variable profit positive target in the -- in probably the low 200,000 units of the range that Mary mentioned. That's based on a pretty consistent demand profile, so as we've seen the demand for the vehicles that we're producing and the way that customers have received them, we think we can keep that up. So to the extent that we see any pricing softness or demand retreat we might have to revisit that, but we feel very good about the trajectory that we are on right now. Itay Michaeli : Perfect. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. You may go head. Rod Lache : Good morning. Hey, Mary and Paul. I wanted to first ask -- from the outside at least, it looks like there's a lot more scrutiny being applied to capital allocation. I'm thinking about the posture that you're talking about for Cruise and BrightDrop and the adjustments to EV spending. So my question is, just on the surface it looks like the pendulum has moved a little bit from growth to cash flow. Are these kind of temporary changes or are you kind of thinking about adjustments to GM strategy? Mary Barra : Hi Rod, thanks for your comments. I wouldn't necessarily say change in our strategy, I think as we've continued to progress in the EV transformation we have found more ways to be much more efficient with capital. And I do want to correct a statement I made earlier where I said, we'd eliminated 1,000 selectable options across our portfolio. It was really a hundred. Although, I think I have a new stretch target for the team as we take the initiative global. But its initiatives like that of continue to look for ways to optimize the capital. When you look at our ICE portfolio, the investment that we made in the last part of the last decade really sets us up well to have all new products coming off the existing platforms, whether it's full-size trucks, full-size SUVs, mid-size SUVs, etc. And so, we're looking to continue to be very focused with capital to make sure it's going to generate the right return. And I would also say we are prioritizing, continuing to return cash to our shareholders as we go through this transformation, because we think the strength of our business, especially our ICE business allows us to do that. So it's not a change in strategy. I would say on some of the business you mentioned like BrightDrop and others, as we look at the business. I think it\u2019s important is we started them to give them some room, but as we got clarity on where the real opportunity for GM was, we could make those businesses much more efficient. And we're going to continue to do that to work on our cost structure to make every dollar a capital count. But we still see growth opportunity. I mean, we had a revenue growth of 10% last year. So we still have many initiatives in which to grow. We're just going to do it in a very optimized way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Your line is open. Dan Ives : Yes, thanks. So can you just talk about Cruise? What are some of the targets for this year that we should think about that would just give more confidence that we've turned the corner there? I mean, from an investor perspective. And how you look into that long term, you are committed to Cruise, right? That's the best way to think about that once get through some of these situations. Mary Barra : Yes, appreciate the question, Dan. We are committed to Cruise. When we look at the technology, the foundational technology is sound. We had already demonstrated and validated externally that Cruise technology is already safer than a human driver. One of the things we've learned is, humans expect technology computers to be much more safe than they -- their expectations than they have for other people. And with that knowledge we are already working on what the level of the technology needs to be to meet the consumers' expectations. We think we can do that, so we are committed. And we are working on the detailed plan right now of how we'll go forward. We're also looking -- the other big learning was, as you roll out technology that is as transformative as this and has incredible benefits to safety, you have to do it in a way where you're really working with the regulators at the local, state, and federal level, as well as first responders. So as we roll out anywhere, we are going to make sure we build the right relationships, they understand the technology, they understand what\u2019s the benefit of the technology, and that's what we'll do. But we have confidence in the underlying technology and you\u2019ll hear more about our plans for Cruise as we develop the plan in the upcoming weeks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just back to the EV's, Mary and Paul. I mean, you talked about the positive variable profit. It sounds like the [LC and RV] (ph) charge going lower is a big portion of that, but you also mentioned some other factors. So I was wondering if you could give a little bit more detail there? And then is this something that you will continually give us on a quarter-by-quarter basis to sort of track the progress you're making towards that positive variable profit. Paul Jacobson : Hey, Joe, it's Paul. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Probably just to digress for a second on the lower of cost or market adjustment on the EV inventory. So a couple of things. Number one, that's not in any of the metrics that I think are important. Clearly it is a year-over-year benefit for us on our journey. But when you think about the two metrics that we're looking at, there isn't an impact from that. So first is variable profit positive. This relates a lot more to sort of EBIT, how we think about that going forward. But variable profit is mainly benefiting from scale and lower material costs going forward. So not a contributor to that. And then when you think about getting to the mid-single digit margin target in 2025, we would expect that there isn't really going to be inventory that\u2019s necessarily carrying that. If there is, we will call that out as we go forward. But it's not in our calculations. They are not a part of what we think our journey is going to be. So I appreciate the question and not surprised by it, but we're continuing to march along. When you think about the -- sorry, the second part of your question was on -- apologies, what\u2019s the second part of your question. Oh, on tracking? Yes, on when we'll disclose. We'll continue to talk about our journey and give confidence as far as specific data points. Not sure that we're going to do it quarterly yet, but we'll continue to update on our progress. Thanks. I'm sorry for that hiccup. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Jonas : Thanks. Just one question and one follow-up. I want to follow up on Rod's question first on strategy. Can you confirm what portion of your forward year CapEx and R&D is dedicated to EV battery, AV projects, the Auto 2.0? Any reason to think that this -- that you may have scope to dial back the vertical integration, given the changing market? And then my follow-up, and again, because I think in the past where you've talked about well over half, I think you said in recent years of your spending was on that, but I just wanted to know if that was changing. And then the follow-up was on Elon Musk recently said that in the absence of trade barriers that China will demolish most of the Western EV players. Curious your reaction to that comment, whether you'd agree? Thanks. Mary Barra : Yes. Thanks, Adam. So from a capital perspective and to build on what I said with Rod, the majority of our capital spend is toward EV. Remember, from an ICE perspective, we have the foundation, already built the plants. And as I mentioned, all of the architectures for our really strong ICE portfolio, that capital has already been deployed. So this is really an opportunity for us to just continue to do great vehicles with very optimized capital from an ICE portfolio as mentioned with the Traverse, the Equinox and the full-size truck, just to name a few. To your point on capital deployed from an infrastructure perspective, as the market evolves and as battery technology evolves, we will continue to evaluate our level of vertical integration. I think with the work we've done on LTM and the work we've done on electric motors and the joint ventures with plant one, two and three, and then four -- our fourth plant is with Samsung, that gives us a different form factor with prismatic and cylindrical cells, I think we're well positioned. But as we move forward, we'll evaluate that. So I think there's options there. And as you can see, with all the initiatives we have, we are really working to take overall capital down, but still get the number of programs that we need. So Adam, I hope that helps. Happy if you have additional questions there. And then on Elon's comments about China, I think, look, I don't discount any competitor. We need to make sure we have beautifully designed vehicles that have the right features, the right safety and the right customer experience. And we have to do it at a competitive cost base, and that's why we're focused so much on our cost base. Now when you mentioned the Chinese consumers, we do need a level playing field. I mean there comes a point where if it's not a level playing field between tariff and nontariff barriers, any industry is going to struggle to compete. So give us a level playing field, and I'll put our products in our cost structure that we continue to improve up against any. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Mary, I just wanted to follow up on the strategy line that Adam and Rod have breached here. I mean we're seeing fits and starts in technology, and it will eventually get there. But at the same time, we are seeing this tectonic shift in competition, particularly coming from China, as Adam alluded to. You made sort of pronouncements on how the business strategy will be set up for a few years not too long ago. But these shifts have been pretty extreme more recently. So I'm just curious, as you think about strategy and the position of the company, you haven't been shy from making big changes in the past like exiting Europe. Can we think about the potential for real shifts in strategy of focus where the highest margin and highest return is sort of in the business truly five to 10 years down the line, which might include things like exiting China, which sounds like heresy, but might be the best move to make for five years out, maybe rebranding Cruise and really kind of taking a new sort of approach to where the company will land in five to 10 years. It's really protect profitability and cash flow from a position of strength instead of maybe a position in five to 10 years where it might be a weaker position. Mary Barra : Hi, John. Thanks for the question. And we continue to evaluate the strategy on a regular basis. We have very robust strategy discussions with our Board and with the leadership team. And as you mentioned, the world is changing quickly whether it's EV, whether it's software, autonomy, et cetera, and we're going to continue to respond to that. I do agree with you that we're doing that from a position of strength. And we'll evaluate where we have the opportunity to deploy capital and generate an appropriate return. And like we made the decision for China -- excuse me, for Europe, when we looked at that, what we said actually has happened. We said it would be a win-win-win, a win for the Opel team, a win for at the time, PSA and a win for General Motors because we participate in the warrants, and we did just that. So we're not going to shy away from making tough calls or maybe calls that people wouldn't expect if we think it's the right thing to do for the business to ensure we're here, we protect our strengths in the markets that we have, whether it's North America. I mentioned on the earnings call, in the top quartile, we've been leading that for several years, and now we profitably have taken the most affordable segment. And we have a strong business in South America and many of our international markets. China, as Paul mentioned, there's tremendous changing not only from a technology point of view but a competitive point of view. And so we're evaluating China. We think there's a place to play. It is a tremendous growth opportunity if we can do that well, and that's our goal. But nothing is off the table in ensuring that GM has a strong future to generate the right profitability and the right return for our investors. John Murphy : And if I could just sneak one follow-up on the plug-in hybrid comment of potentially bringing those here to the U.S. to fill sort of maybe this interim gap. What kind of capacity or volume could you hit there here in the U.S.? I know the dealers are clamoring for those vehicles. Mary Barra : Yes. We are going to be bringing those in at a time where we need them from a compliance perspective. This year, we're very focused in -- I think as we are able to get the delivery to our dealers, they are going to see the strength of the EV portfolio. So I'll have more to share on the hybrid capacity. We'll adjust the capacity because, again, we have the technology. We know the targeted segments that we're going to apply it to. So we'll have the ability to flex and do what we need to from a hybrid perspective. But I think for calendar year 2024, EV is our focus. And we think we've got tremendous growth opportunity as we free up getting the availability of the products to customers. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Obviously, the 2024 outlook is far stronger than investors expected. How much of the higher outlook versus consensus do you think stems from different industry-related factors that are a matter of debate, such as expectations for volume or pricing in different markets versus how much do you think stems from company-specific factors that you would naturally have a better handle on internal to the company such as lower Cruise spending, a potential for more structural cost reduction, the magnitude of guidance [indiscernible] you may be more positive on industry factors, but your pricing comments also seems pretty in line. So not really sure. How are you thinking about like how much of your meeting this great guide in 2024 will come down to factors under your control versus out of your control? Paul Jacobson : So Ryan, thanks for the question. I'll take a shot at that. When you look at the macro backdrop, I think we're approaching it pretty consistently to what we have for the last few years. So we've talked about a 16 million SAAR, about 2% to 2.5% of sort of total pricing pressure across the board. A lot of it is, I would say, a testament to what we achieved and overcame in 2023 that we don't expect to repeat. Of course, there will be some things that pop up as there are every year. And I think the team has done a good job of knocking those things down and overcoming some of those challenges going forward. So against the macro backdrop, that feels a little bit consistent with some conservatism in there on the pricing side of it. I think a lot of it is on our ability to execute. And we have had a lot of challenges, as Mary mentioned. I think 2023 was a big year of learning for us. But as she talked about with the work that we're doing on the module assembly and where we see EV ramp as well as the customer response to the EVs that we're producing, I think this is a year of our executing. And a lot of it is in our control. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. I just wanted to ask on Cruise too, starting with whether the guided $1 billion of lower spending in 2024 versus the 2023 full year $2.7 billion figure or maybe the 4Q run rate of $3.2 billion. And then what has the response been so far? I realize there hasn't been a lot of time passed, but from the regulators to the recently released comprehensive review. Previously, I think you've guided to potentially significantly less than the non-Cruise, maybe on the business update call, but then followed a day or two later at Barclays by saying several hundred million, now it's $1 billion. So of course, you were still waiting for the review at that point. Is there anything to read into the $1 billion being higher than several hundred million? Is that maybe the reception of the review could lead to a more prolonged suspension of commercial operations? And then just finally, the outlook for the EBIT loss in 2024 or whatever is $1.7 billion [indiscernible] it's greater than the $1.3 billion of cash that Cruise had at year-end, right, on, I think, Slide 26 or so. So it\u2019s that just capital raise, curious on the thoughts there? Mary Barra : So, Ryan, there's a lot in there, but let me first by saying the response from regulators has been positive. So -- and we'll continue to have that outreach and build that relationship and be transparent with them. You shouldn't read too much into what we said shortly thereafter we learned of the situation. We went in and did a lot of work. And I got a -- I have to give our co-presidents, Craig Glidden and [indiscernible] credit for going in and really staying focused on the technology, making sure we keep the very talented software engineers that are doing incredible work and have allowed us to already clock 5 million miles of driverless miles. So it was really just going to look a lot of where the opportunity to cut costs came from, the change in strategy to really focus on one city to demonstrate it as opposed to -- you remember at one point, they were talking about 20 cities this year. And so, there were a lot of people who had been recently added more from an operational standpoint that we were able to exit those employees. But clearly a focus on the technology. And the way I look at this is, we're going to make sure we do it right from a regulatory, a consumer, a customer relationship perspective, get the technology where we think it would be. And then once we're informed by doing it well in the cities, then we'll have the opportunity to go quickly and scale from there. So don't read anything into the $1 billion other than we went and did the work and saw the opportunity. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions on cash. One is, you're guiding to $8 billion to $10 billion of free cash. And that pro forma gets your cash balance on the balance sheet to something like $28 billion to $30 billion at the end of 2024. To what extent are you willing to put forward another share buyback plan beyond what you have -- if the target is to have cash balance of $20 billion? And the second question is on Cruise on cash. They're at roughly $1.3 billion. I think that gives you a little less than a year of runway on cash. So what's the plan on further funding for Cruise? Thank you. Mary Barra : So on the further funding at Cruise, I'll take that, and I'll have Paul answer -- excuse me, the other question. As we get the detailed plan of how we're going to relaunch Cruise in the road map, then we'll evaluate the overall funding needs. And we'll determine is it internal or externally sourced. Paul Jacobson : And Dan, on your question on cash, I think the simple math is correct. We would obviously see a sizable increase in our cash balance. Our capital allocation stance remains the same, which is to invest in the business. And we've talked about $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion of CapEx this year. We have been streamlining that and making that efficient and a priority to drive free cash flow. And as we look at the balance sheet, I think the balance sheet is in really good shape. And there's no change to our stance of, call it, $18 billion or about $20 billion of cash on hand. So clearly, we've demonstrated a renewed commitment and prioritization of returning cash to shareholders. And we'll maintain that flexibility going forward. Dan Levy : Just to clarify, the $18 billion, $20 billion, is that a target or is that a floor? Paul Jacobson : That's kind of been our floor/targeted range. Obviously, we've carried quite a bit more than that over the last few years as we dealt with some of the uncertainty. But as we imagine -- or as we said in November when we announced the share repurchase with a lot of that uncertainty behind us, lower CapEx spending, we felt comfortable operating at that lower balance. So $18 billion to $20 billion feels very comfortable as the targeted range. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. First of all, I was hoping to ask you about the scale required to achieve the profitability goals. So I think when you shared those goals back in November, in particular, the 60-point EBIT margin improvement this year, I think 60% of that came from scale. I'm curious if the 200,000 to 300,000 units you're planning for this year, is that enough to get you that scale? So are you counting more on like lower battery costs and maybe a bit of a shift in terms of some of the savings? And then similar question on the mid-single-digit EBIT margin target for next year. I think some of it was going to come from scale. What kind of unit volume you need to get the scale piece of -- to get to these targets? Paul Jacobson : Good morning Emmanuel. Thanks for the questions. On the 2024 numbers, I think they're wholly consistent with the 200,000 to 300,000 range that we've articulated here. And as I mentioned earlier in response to a question around EVs, the low 200,000 is kind of what gets us to the point where we feel comfortable about getting the variable profit positive from there. Obviously, growth is a component, but it's a much smaller component of the walk from 2024 to 2025 than it is from 2023 to 2024. But it will require some growth. We're not going to commit to that other than just to say kind of that's where we stand, and we'll see where customer demand is going forward. And the other point, if I didn't make it earlier on the lower battery raw material costs, keep in mind that we don't start to see meaningful benefit from that until we get to the middle part of the year, because a lot of the cells that we have in inventory were built with higher raw materials costs. So while we're producing cells today, we're going first in, first out on the cells. So we have a little bit of a lag before we realize that. That lower battery raw material cost of about $4,000 a vehicle that we articulated, we'll also have some annualization benefits in 2025 since we're not getting the full benefit here in 2024. I hope that's helpful. Emmanuel Rosner : Yes, very helpful. Thank you. One very quick follow-up on Cruise. The spending, $1 billion lower for this year. Is that -- could that be considered sort of like a new run rate for spending? Or is it sort of like a temporary situation as a result of some of the parts currently in the testing and rollout? Mary Barra : Emmanuel, I would consider it right now it's our best estimate for this year. Obviously, as we develop a much more detailed plan that will inform over the next couple of years what the spending needs to be, so more to come. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open. Chris McNally : Thanks, team. Great numbers. Mary, I just want to shift gears and talk maybe advanced ADAS and software really quickly. Super Cruise, you introduced in 2018. You don't put out too many usage numbers, but I think in the middle of last year, you talked about almost 100 million miles [indiscernible]. Even if we double that for time passage, it's not many vehicles, tens of thousands. We also read Ultra Cruise has now been installed. Just high level, isn't this a very slow pace for Level 2+ product? Tesla has been providing for a decade charging anywhere from 6,000 to 12,000 for top versions. I guess the question is, isn't this becoming a big miss opportunity for GM at this point for additional revenue? Even Slide 7, I think, only shows one of the ICE launches, the Traverse highlighting Super Cruise. So just a broad update when we could start to see what is a technology probably everyone wants at more sort of mass deployment scale across your fleet? Mary Barra : Yes. Chris, appreciate the question. I think back in the 2018 time frame, I think we should have, in hindsight, put it across the portfolio much more quickly. It's not a number of models. I don't have it off the top of my head. Ashish, we can provide that. But it's on a number of models across the portfolio right now. As we launch the Traverse this year will be added to the Traverse. Again, we're seeing extremely strong response from customers where I think it's over 80%, 85% of customers once they experience the technology say they would never -- they would not want a car without it or they would strongly prefer it on their vehicle, which, in my experience, is a pretty high interest rate for a single technology. So we're committed. We're going to continue to develop. And we have been, along the way, adding more roads and adding more capability, whether it's lane change, whether it's trailering. So there's a robust plan to continue to improve Super Cruise, and we'll stay on that. And we are seeing the profitability benefits. And the more vehicles to your point, we get it on, the better it will be. And we're committed to do that. And frankly, have done quite a bit already. And we can provide that. Chris McNally : No, that's -- and just in terms of the evolution of the speed, is it a technology bottleneck? Or is it more just marketing? Meaning, like you thought of it as a premium product, you charge sort of a premium rate compared to other GM add-ons? Or is it just like you said, there's a cost to putting it on every vehicle on the RD&E. So that could increase, but it would obviously be an engineering cost to get it on more vehicles. Mary Barra : Yes. No, we are committed to getting it on many vehicles as possible. In some cases, we had planned to make it standard. The semiconductor shortage kind of slowed us down on that because if [indiscernible] building a vehicle at all or waiting to build it with Super Cruise. So we are very committed to getting across many vehicles. We've dramatically taken the cost down on the technology. So it's a really good value. And in my opinion, we're deploying it as quickly as we can. And it's really just with -- there is engineering required and some sensors required when you add it to a new vehicle, but we're doing that in a very cadenced but as quick as possible fashion. Chris McNally : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open. Gautam Narayan : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to kind of make sure I got all the good points here on the bridge in 2023 to 2024 -- sorry, a boring question. You have, I guess, price down 2% to 2.5%, $200 million cost savings, Cruise down $1 billion, higher labor 1.3. Three items not quantified were market share gains, you guys called out in the slide, EV margin improvement, and the third is lower mix. Just curious if we could get a sense of order of magnitude for those three last buckets? Paul Jacobson : Tom, I'll suggest that we take that off-line, work through any modeling details. But at the end of the day, clearly, the commercial market, as we talked about, we expect to be relatively stable and pricing down 2% to 2.5%. Not going to get into the specifics about how we're thinking about market share gains other than to say, fairly consistent about what we've been doing for the last few years going forward. And then on EVs, a lot of that, we will continue to talk about as we come to sort of later Investor Day and subsequent calls going forward. I think we've given good detail on the overall walk on vehicle program level. Gautam Narayan : Okay. Sure. And as a quick follow-up, typically, when -- if an OEM, let's say, changes production levels, so in this case, EV, if you move to plug-in hybrids or what have you, there are monies that get paid to suppliers, right, for that, let's say, they have to cut production of EV components. Just curious if those supplier concessions if you were to, let's say, reduce EV production or shift to plug-in hybrids with -- are those something that you've envisioned in the 2024 guidance? Paul Jacobson : So Tom, I think our -- we've got great relationships with our suppliers and a team that works very, very closely with them. They have been, I would say, very patient with us over the last few years, because we've had a lot of volatility. And in those situations where we need to help, we've been willing to do that going forward. And we always look at both efficiencies and any challenges in our annual budget process, and this year is no different. Gautam Narayan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing remarks. Mary Barra : Thank you very much. And thanks, everybody, for your questions. I'd like to share just a couple of thoughts before we close. Fundamentally, we believe we are well positioned to have a strong year, thanks to our success in high-margin and growing ICE segments, our expanding EV portfolio, our cost discipline and our continuous improvements to design, engineering, supply chain, manufacturing and marketing process improvements. In addition, we are prioritizing the return of cash to our shareholders on a consistent basis as we execute the plan. We know we must execute in every part of the business in 2024, not just ICE. And I can assure you we will. So thank you for your continued support and for joining today's call, and please stay safe. Operator : That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. We are asking analysts to limit their questions to one and a brief follow-up. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, April 23rd, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the Safe Harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. In January, we outlined clear priorities for 2024 that are designed to build on our strength and learn from the challenges we faced in 2023. I'm very pleased to share that the team is executing well against all of them. Around the world, we are very focused on growth and profitability, which means taking full advantage of our winning product portfolio to grow share without chasing unprofitable business. In North America, the fundamental strengths of Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac truly stand out. The team delivered a 10.6% EBIT margin in the quarter, thanks to our industry-leading full-size pickups, the momentum we're building in midsized pickups, the growth we are seeing in our SUV business, profit improvement in our EV portfolio and our overall operating discipline. We again grew retail shares and market share in the US during the quarter with incentives that remained well below the industry average, especially in our truck business. We grew our combined Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickup sales by 3% year-over-year and grew our retail market share 1.8 points to 43.8% with much lower incentives than our closest competitors whose sales were down. In March, we doubled sales of the GMC Canyon year-over-year. And the Chevrolet Colorado was the fastest-growing truck in the midsize pickup segment, thanks to its purity of function, simple elegance in execution and value. Those are MotorTrend's words, not mine. We also continue to gain market share and grow EBIT with our new small SUVs, including the Chevrolet Trax and the Buick Envista. These vehicles are helping us win new customers, and we will continue to excel at customer retention. During the quarter, S&P Global Mobility announced that GM has now had the highest loyalty of any OEM for nine consecutive years. That's a powerful competitive advantage. In our EV business, we are building momentum in production and profitability. For example, we have increased battery module production by 300% over the last six months. Quality is very good and continuing to improve. And the installation and validation of our new high-speed module assembly lines is on track. We are projecting to double our current capacity by the end of the summer. EV production rose sharply during the quarter, and our dealers translated that into a 21% year-over-year increase in EV retail customer deliveries. For example, the Cadillac LYRIQ outsold all of the EVs from European luxury brands in the first quarter. And since mid-March, we are now delivering Chevrolet Blazer EVs with updated and improved software. All of our product programs are benefiting from the end-to-end improvements we've made in software, including the increased rigor we have instilled in our quality and validation processes. More importantly, the talented executives and engineers we've hired from the tech industry are raising the bar for software design and execution, which will help us truly differentiate our customer experience and the suite of software-driven products and services we offer. We're also making progress at Cruise. The team is back on the road in Phoenix updating mapping, gathering more road information. This is a critical step for validating our improved self-driving system and building upon the more than 5 million driverless miles we've logged before the pause. We are engaging frequently with regulators and stakeholders and building trust as we regain momentum. Safety will remain front and center and will guide our progress. I am pleased with our ICE performance, our progress in EV execution and growth, our new software organization's performance and the steps we're taking to regain momentum at Cruise. In addition, I'm very proud of the GM team and all of our stakeholders for really leaning in to keep our momentum going. Their commitment and tenacity helped give us the confidence to raise our full year 2024 EBIT, EPS and automotive adjusted free cash flow guidance. In our ICE business, the redesigned Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Chevrolet Equinox are all launching in high-volume segments starting this quarter. So are the Chevrolet Spin and the S10 in South America, and they have higher margins than the outgoing models. Then this summer, the stunning new Buick Enclave will arrive. It's the first Enclave to offer Super Cruise. Later in the year, we will make important design and technology upgrades to our best-selling GMC Yukon, Chevrolet Tahoe and Chevrolet Suburban full-size SUVs. They include redesigned, tech-focused interiors, safety and security features that include a suite of connected cameras, riding handling improvements, styling enhancements and more. Mark and our performance team also have the unbelievable Corvette ZR1 coming and we can't wait to put customers behind the wheel. And we've already begun installing equipment at our Fort Wayne assembly plant to produce our next-generation full-size ICE pickups. In our EV business, the Ultium Cell plant in Spring Hill is shipping sales and scaling production through the year. The Chevrolet Equinox EV will arrive in showrooms this quarter, and we're very excited because it will be the most affordable long-range EV in the market. It will also offer Super Cruise like all of our Chevrolet GMC and Cadillac EVs on the Ultium platform. We will then introduce more affordable trim series for the Chevrolet Equinox EV, the Blazer EV and the Silverado EV in the second half of the year, which will help grow volume and share. Also in the second half of the year, Cadillac will expand its EV lineup to include the OPTIQ and the Escalade IQ. This is important because EV adoption in luxury segments is higher and more resilient than in the broader market. Two of our most highly anticipated launches are the GMC Sierra EV Denali and the Chevrolet Silverado EV RST. They are best-in-class in ways that truly matter to truck customers. By optimizing the battery, aerodynamics and other systems, we were able to increase the range of the RST and the Denali by 10% to an estimated 440 miles, which is about 40 miles better than the median range of ICE vehicles on the road today. No EV pickup on the road today even comes close and it's possible to go even further. A few weeks ago, two road testers took the RST on a drive from Las Vegas to Phoenix. And they drove it like customers do on paved and gravel roads at freeway speeds at different temperatures and different elevations. At the end, they managed to travel 460 miles on a single charge. It's the same story for towing. One journalist drove a Silverado EV work truck and three competing battery electric trucks on a 500-mile trip over the Rocky Mountains while towing trailers. It wasn't even a competition. The Silverado EV stopped once to charge, while every other truck had to stop four to five times. Chevrolet and GMC are also the only pickup brands that allow drivers to tow while using Super Cruise, our hands-free driving technology. That's just one of the several features that uniquely differentiates our products. This is exactly the kind of design and engineering functionality that excites people, motivates them and turns them into customers. It's the same formula for Chevrolet and GMC have filed with ICE trucks, and those results speak for themselves. Based on the feedback we're hearing from customers and dealers, the early sales momentum we are seeing, we're confident that continuing to scale EV production is the right move. We know that transparency matters in every transformation. So Paul and I will give you regular updates throughout the year, including at our Investor Day we're planning for this fall as we achieve our EV production, sales and profitability milestones. All of these great ICE and EV products were made possible by the investments we made to drive transformation and growth. As a result, our spending was above historic levels for several years. Now that the foundation is largely built and we're starting to see results, our focus has turned back to driving free cash flow through enhanced profitability and capital discipline, finding ways to spend less for the same results and with an unwavering focus on the customer. You're already seeing some examples of this. Our winning with simplicity discipline is a great example of how we're improving capital efficiency and lowering costs. The next-generation Ultium-based Chevrolet Bolt EV is another. It's a profitable and capital-efficient program that will deliver one of the most affordable electric vehicles around when it arrives in late 2025. There will be many more examples as we move forward. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Paul to take you through our results and our new higher guidance for the calendar year. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning. We're off to a good start to the year and I'd like to thank our team for all their hard work in helping deliver another strong set of financial results. We experienced consistent pricing trends during the quarter, below the 2% to 2.5% headwind we built into our full year guidance. For Q1, pricing was down only about $200 million year-over-year driven by demand for our products and a disciplined go-to-market strategy that prioritizes profitability and margins. And so far in April, we've seen pricing remain relatively consistent. That said, our comparisons get tougher as we lap price increases taken in Q2 of last year. The US retail industry experienced a slight mix shift away from the full-size truck segment during the quarter. However, we increased our volume and share with lower incentives than our competitors, which speaks to our strong truck franchises and our customer loyalty. Retail sales were up 6%, while fleet sales decreased more than 20% driven by two main factors. First, we encountered some production constraints impacting the timing of fleet deliveries on our commercial van and midsize pickups. We expect to recover most of this volume in the second half of the year. Second, we made the strategic decision to produce more retail full-size SUVs compared to last year to satisfy our strong customer demand. Retail sales on our full-size SUVs have a higher trim mix that earned us more revenue per vehicle. We are committed to growing our strong and profitable fleet business, but we'll continue to balance fleet and retail customer demands with a focus on profitability. We generated healthy cash flow during the quarter, helping support $600 million of year-to-date open market stock repurchases incremental to the ongoing ASR, retiring another 14 million shares since the beginning of the year. We now have approximately $800 million remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization. In addition, we completed the first tranche of the $10 billion ASR last fall, retiring 4 million shares in Q1. Our fully diluted share count at the end of the quarter was 1.16 billion, down 17% from where we were just one year ago. Given the strong momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the 2024 outlook, we are raising full year guidance to EBIT adjusted in the $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted to the $9 to $10 range and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $8.5 billion to $10.5 billion range. Now let's get into the Q1 results. We grew total company revenue by 8% to $43 billion driven by higher wholesale volumes in North America. Over the last 24 months, we've achieved consistent revenue growth, resulting in a CAGR of more than 15% over that period. We also achieved $3.9 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.0% EBIT adjusted margins and $2.62 in EPS diluted adjusted. EBIT adjusted was up year-over-year and well above consensus driven by our continued strong ICE performance, improving EV profitability and our strategic cost actions, mitigating the effect of higher labor costs. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.1 billion, up materially versus being flat in Q1 of 2023 driven by improved working capital benefits through inventory management and production timing. North America delivered Q1 EBIT adjusted margins of 10.6%, driving $3.8 billion of EBIT adjusted, up $300 million year-over-year primarily from higher wholesale volumes combined with steady pricing and ongoing cost containment. During the quarter, we continued to benefit from our fixed cost reduction program, realizing an incremental $300 million from lower marketing and engineering spend. Our fixed cost base is at its lowest since Q1 2022 and we are on track to achieve the full $2 billion net of depreciation and amortization by the end of 2024. Dealer inventory levels ended the quarter slightly above our 50 to 60 day end-of-year target at 63 days. However, we believe we are well positioned from an inventory standpoint as we head into a seasonally stronger part of the year and incur a few weeks of planned downtime in Q2 on our full-size pickups to prepare for future launches and to install new equipment. GM International Q1 EBIT adjusted was breakeven, down $350 million year-over-year. China equity income was a loss of $100 million, down $200 million year-over-year as we lowered production to balance dealer inventory levels. This was slightly better-than-expected due to a continued focus on cost efficiencies. Having made progress reducing inventory levels, production is normalizing, and we expect to return to profitability in Q2. EBIT adjusted in GM International excluding China equity income was $100 million, down $150 million year-over-year driven by lower volume in South America and strategic decisions to protect margins. We anticipate new product launches and further cost efficiencies will help drive profitability improvements beginning in Q2. GM Financial continues to perform well with Q1 EBT adjusted of $700 million, in line with last year and tracking well within the full year $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance range. They continue to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter. Cruise expenses were $400 million in the quarter, down from $800 million in Q4 '23, reflecting our cost reduction activities and a more focused operational plan. As Mary mentioned, Cruise is resuming operations in Phoenix, along with testing in simulated environments and on closed courses while they work to earn trust and build partnerships with regulators and customers. We expect full year Cruise expenses to be around $1.7 billion. Let's move now to one of the most important metrics we're focused on, EV profitability. We continue to see sequential and year-over-year improvements in variable profit and EBIT margins as we benefit from scale, material cost and mix improvements. Since last year, we have significantly reduced cell costs with a large driver being lower battery raw material costs, especially for lithium. We ramped our first battery JV plant last year, and as they increased production and made other efficiencies, the cost of cells came down significantly. And cell plant number two in Tennessee is ramping even faster based on the learnings from plant one and is expected to reach full installed capacity by the end of the year. Collectively, these factors are helping improve vehicle profitability. For example, we have seen more than $12,000 of year-over-year cost savings in the LYRIQ alone. As we continue to ramp, we expect to see the benefits from the production tax credit continue to grow and our fixed cost absorption to improve meaningfully. We wholesaled 22,000 Ultium-based EVs in Q1, up from less than 2,000 in the first quarter of last year and remain on track to achieve our 200,000 to 300,000 unit production and wholesale volume target for 2024. We will share more on EV profitability as we progress through the year. I would also like to touch on EV pricing, which we recently adjusted on the 2024 Blazer EV. This action has been well received by our dealers and customers. And as Mary mentioned, the vehicle is gaining momentum. We assumed some pricing pressure for both ICE and EVs in our business plan and guidance for 2024, but we continue to work on finding additional offsets through cost performance and other efficiencies. Importantly, this pricing action doesn't change our expectation to achieve positive variable profit for our EV portfolio in the second half of the year or our mid-single-digit margin target in 2025. We remain confident that when consumers see our new EVs and get a chance to drive them, they will appreciate the unique combination of design, performance, range and value that we offer at multiple price points. And because of our supply chain efforts, customers are well positioned to leverage the $7,500 clean energy consumer purchase tax credit. In closing, I want to reiterate our capital allocation framework along with our intention to be much more consistent in how we deploy capital. We are generating strong cash flow, which is funding our EV transformation and growth opportunities. These efforts include investing in future products, transitioning manufacturing capacity to EVs and deploying resources into cutting-edge battery technology. At the same time, you've seen us adapt to the dynamic market, particularly for EVs and made bold decisions to be more efficient with our capital spend, something we will continue to do moving forward. Our balance sheet remains strong. And on shareholder returns, we executed the ASR last November and the response has been overwhelmingly positive, with GM stock outperforming its peers and being up nearly 50% since the announcement. We have seen about a one turn improvement in our P/E multiple since the ASR, but we are still significantly undervalued relative to our historical average as well as our competitors and other industrial companies. Obviously, we're not satisfied and know that we have a lot of work to do on our valuation and remain committed to improving it. As we move forward, we believe the strong cash generated by our ICE portfolio along with improved execution on our EV strategy as well as tangible progress on Cruise will help generate significant returns for all GM stakeholders. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Spak with UBS. You may proceed. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Mary Barra : Good morning. Joseph Spak : First on the guidance, Paul, I just want to understand the pricing assumption. Is it now just 2% to 2.5% negative for the remaining three quarters? And then you mentioned a couple of things on mix. So you've got higher EV sales, smaller crossovers. Both of those seem like they should continue through the year. And then I think you also mentioned some potential trim headwinds in pickups. But then on the other hand, you have the EV variable profit turning positive in the second half. So I guess I just want to understand a little bit better how those all intersect. And should we actually see some maybe net improvement in mix as we move through the year? Paul Jacobson : Good morning, Joe. You're right that at the end of the day, 2% to 2.5% for the rest of the year is in our assumptions. So essentially what we have done with the guidance is taken the outperformance that we saw in Q1 and built it into the full year. So really not much has changed on the assumption going forward. So when you look at seasonality and you look at trend lines, keep in mind, in the second half of the year, we've got more EV volume coming in. And also we've got some of those pricing headwinds that we've built in. So we feel like this is a good move to go ahead and take it up from where we are. But we're still sort of guided by the same principles as when we put out our initial guidance for the year going forward. So as far as mix goes, we've talked about that a lot. We've obviously been trending fairly strong. We are lapping some price increases that we took last year. So as I said, the year-over-year comps get a little bit more difficult. But overall, I think the market is holding up fairly well. And as we said before, if we see pricing continuing with this momentum, we expect that we'd be in a position to take up guidance again. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. As a second question just on Cruise, with the re-launch, I understand the manually operated and mapping. But Mary you emphasized an improved system. So maybe you could just give us a little bit more color on how much of the existing technology stack is really sort of being leveraged and what's been redone. And then just on the financial side, does the guidance assume any further steps towards that re-launch? And what about capital need with the cash bounce down to $700 million? Mary Barra : Sure. Well, first, Cruise, we're very excited that they're back on the roads in Phoenix. As we said, it is manual, but then we'll progress to supervised and then to unsupervised. And the core tech stack, what we've been doing since we made the decision to pause is continuing to work and improving it. So we've actually strengthened the safety of the system by continuing to make sure we comprehend, I would say, a low probability but higher severity type issues. Because what we recognized in October although I think mainly it was an issue of not having built the right relationship with the regulatory agencies at all levels as well as the public and then being transparent, but we also realized even though we demonstrated and externally validated that the technology was safer than an average human driver, we need to do more. And so that's what we've been focused on. That's why we're -- as we're going back to Phoenix, we're making sure we're up to date. But very excited about where we are in the technology and very much believe in it. For what we plan to do this year of getting back on the road and demonstrating that the model works in one city, as I've said in the past and then expanding from there. We believe it's comprehended in the budget that we have. And then as you look at how we plan to fund the business, we're exploring quite a few options right now, including potentially outside -- taking outside investments as well. And so we'll have more to say about that as we move through the year. But I'm very excited to be back on the road. We believe in the technology. We're making it even better. That didn't stop through this whole period since last October. Joseph Spak : Thanks for the color. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good morning everyone and congrats. Just two questions for me. Maybe first for Paul. Just can you remind us how we should think about the volume mix of your new and refreshed ICE crossovers that the next couple of quarters and how you're thinking about the prior margin improvement targets that you spoke about, I think, it was last quarter? And then maybe for Mary hopefully you can kind of go back to the software strategy and maybe talk about some of the goals that we should be expecting for software and the Ultifi platform over the next six to 12 months? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Good morning, Itay. Thanks for the question. On our crossovers, we've talked about the new Chevy Trax and Buick Envista, both of which are significantly improved from their prior profitability of the -- before the upgrades. And we've seen, particularly the Chevy Trax, really take off. Sales were up 500% in the quarter, and it's really performing well for us. So some of the trends in average transaction prices, I think, are muddied by the fact that the volume on those crossovers are going up considerably. But we've still seen strength in our truck pricing and our SUV pricing as well. So we continue to think that, that's accretive and additive to the portfolio and it's built into our strong guidance that we're updating today. Mary Barra : And then as it relates to the software strategy as we move through the year and beyond, first, as Mike stepped back over the past year, though, he did an incredible job of re-evaluating and changing our software development process as well as our validation process and brought in an incredibly strong team of probably more than a dozen people at the senior level to really focus on having the right software strategy as we move forward. So I'm very confident. We paused at the beginning this year with the Blazer as we saw a limited number of consumers had an issue where we've moved past that now. And that's allowed us to strengthen the software of all of our upcoming vehicles. And so the goals for the next couple of months are to launch with quality on time, and we're on a path to do that. And then as we go forward, as the new software goes across multiple vehicles then that gives us an opportunity to focus more on growing subscriptions and services. But I'm very pleased with where we are, with the team that we have and the progress they've made. And it's showing in our ability to launch with quality. Itay Michaeli : Perfect. That's all very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, everybody. Mary, I just wanted to ask one strategic question on China. At this point, it's really not a moneymaker for you. And there's a lot of, obviously, noise on a geopolitical basis and sort of our relationship or the US relationship with China. I'm just curious, is it time to really start thinking about strategic alternatives over there to potentially closing or selling the business? How do you kind of think about that in the context of sort of the broader portfolio over the next few years? Mary Barra : Yes. Just in general, with everything that's happened over the last several years with COVID and then with the supply chain issues around the chip shortage and then just broad supply chain issues, we have worked and really strengthened the resiliency of our supply chain, and we'll continue to do that. But over the long-term, we're committed to China. We believe that it's a market that, over the medium term, will have substantial growth. We're continuing to draw on not only our global solutions, but in some cases, local solutions as we advance our electrification strategy. Right now, NEVs account for about 30% of GM's total China deliveries from a Q1 perspective. And we're going to build on that through this year because we have an intense NEV launch cadence. From Q2 then moving forward, we have several PHEVs we'll be launching and moving with full EVs as well. So we also have established the Durant Guild, and that allows us to focus on some niche segments in China that are premium and more lifestyle-oriented. And for instance, the Tahoe and the Yukon will be available for pre-order later this year. So we think, clearly, that market has shifted and the landscape has shifted from -- with the capability of the Chinese OEMs. But we still think there's a role in a place for GM to play with luxury premium. And again, as I mentioned, leveraging not only our global solutions but local solutions. So that is our focus, but we've done that while focusing on supply chain resiliency as well. John Murphy : Okay. And then I just have one quick follow-up on pricing. Saying 2% to 2.5%, I understand is your best estimate right now. But calling pricing is difficult. So I'm just curious, maybe, Paul, if you could give us sort of a high level how you think about pricing because there's a lot of cross currents. I mean there's EV price cutting, but there seems like there is resilience on the ICE side. When you look at your cap, you're at 100% capacity utilization, which means you're kind of tight on your sort of structural supply. Look at zero to six-year old vehicles, they're going to continue to shrink through the next two years probably. So like the used vehicle market is going to stay relatively tight. So I mean I think people are looking at this dealer inventory and saying, hey, things are getting a little bit toppy. There's risk on pricing. But when you look at some of the structural aspects of supply, they're reasonably constrained. And it seems like even in a Tier 2 and 3 supply base, they're constrained and on labor. I mean I just -- it just seems like its resilience may be with us a little bit longer than people are fearing. I mean the Colorado Canyon as well as your vans you said you were short on some stuff that you're getting to fleets that you'll catch up later in the year. So there's \u2013 and there's just all these kind of pockets of shortages that still persist. And it seems like the kind of things going to last for longer than people are fearing. How do you really kind of concoct or come up with that estimate of 2% to 2.5%? And where do you think things will kind of land over the next couple of years? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Well, look, good morning, John. As we've talked about, the 2% to 2.5%, I want to be very clear, is not an expectation. That's an assumption that we've put into the guidance and provided for people to run their models from that standpoint. But as we've seen with the first quarter outperformance, we weren't there. And April is actually holding up quite well for us with ATPs actually trending slightly higher than where they did coming out of the quarter. So not really an expectation as much as we've built an assumption in recognizing that there may be some macro headwinds out there. We do know that our comps get tougher as we lap our price increases that we took in the summer of last year. But overall, the commercial environment continues to be resilient. And I think this is a very common theme that we've had now for more than a year worth of quarters of -- there's a lot of sort of downward bias, but we're continuing to manage commercially month-to-month and producing in line with demand. And I think with that balance, it's been very favorable for us on both pricing and margins. John Murphy : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, John. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. First quarter EBIT was strong and annualizing at about $15.5 billion. I think guidance for the full year on EBIT is now $12.5 billion to $14.5 billion for the year. So I'm hoping to better understand some of the factors that temper EBIT over the balance of the year compared to the first quarter run rate. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Good morning, Mark. So I would say it comes down to a couple of things. One is there's still the assumption in there of the down 2% to 2.5%. And as we scale up EVs and we continue to make progress about getting them to variable profit positive, the margins on those are not as strong as ICE, obviously. So we see a little bit of pressure in the back half from that. But overall we'll remain consistent. And as I've said, if we don't see that pricing softness, I would expect that there's an opportunity to outperform these numbers. Mark Delaney : That's helpful, Paul. Another question on EVs and on the pricing topic. The company spoke to good demand and feedback for its EVs, but the broader market has been quite competitive for EV in terms of pricing. Hoping to better understand if you think GM is going to need to take additional pricing actions this year to reach the 200,000 to 300,000 outlook that you have in North America? Or did the demand signals you have from the market suggests you can hit that kind of volumes this year with relatively firm pricing going forward? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Sure. Well, obviously, the early results here as we're ramping up Ultium are pretty strong with retail sales up about 20% year-over-year despite the fact that the Bolt, which is sunsetting the prior generation was down about 60% during the quarter. So retail demand remained strong. We've obviously seen a lot of softness in fleet, particularly on the rental side for EVs, but we see customers responding. Now these are on admittedly lower volumes as we scale up, but we're building that momentum that I think we need with the products to be able to show consumers what our capabilities are. When you look at the statistics that Mary cited in the script about the range and what's in our earnings deck, you see that the purpose-built EVs are actually better in terms of performance, range, charging speed, towing capabilities, et cetera, than many of the other products that are out there on the market. And I think as consumers continue to see that, we'll be well positioned as EV demands at the retail side continue to trend. So we're obviously going to watch it closely, but the early indications are strong. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Your line is open. Daniel Ives : Yes, thanks. So does it -- and for Mary and Paul, does it feel like now like the UAW in the rearview mirror, why the EV strategy now coming to fruit that the company is just in a strong position, which is less uncertainty? I mean could you just maybe compare today even six to nine months ago internally? Mary Barra : No, I think you make a really good point, Dan. We do -- I feel much better of where we are, as I mentioned. We now have -- we're ramping up and the module issue is behind us. All the additional lines that we were scaling are all on track. So we feel very good about that. Obviously, we're pleased that we were able to get an agreement with UAW. We continue to work with them on a number of fronts and build the relationship with the new leadership team as they were named pretty close to when we started negotiations last year. So I feel that we're continuing to talk, raise issues with each other and problem solve where we have challenges. So I feel much better about that. And as Paul said, we're seeing good progress with our Ultium-based EVs because they are purpose-built and they do have -- there's -- customer's not making a trade-off. And we also see the charging infrastructure get better every quarter. So I feel very good about where we are and I think we've got momentum. And believe me, we have a very aligned team across GM that is going to seize all these opportunities. I would also add, Dan, that I feel very good, as I mentioned earlier, about where we are with software. The work and the talent that is in the company now and the progress that we've made gives me confidence we're going to be in a good position there as well. So from last year to now, much better, much more positive. Daniel Ives : Great. Congrats. Mary Barra : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Just thinking about wholesale growth for the full year. Global volumes were up almost 4% in the quarter. Can you help dimension the impact for this current quarter's full-size pickup downtime? And just what the full -- what the first half versus second half split might look like for the Ultium volumes relative to that 200,000 to 300,000 units targeted? Thanks. Mary Barra : Well I can -- let me just comment on full-size pickups. We have taken -- announced that we have some down weeks to start installing equipment, so we can have a seamless launch as we get to the next model. And we're just going to stay focused on where the customer demand is at. We feel we've got really strong products that, as Paul mentioned, we're growing share. We grew share in the first half with strong pricing. So I think that speaks for the strength of our product. But we're going to be customer demand, and we're going to make sure that we don't overbuild because I think it's important to manage residuals and to make sure that we're managing our inventory. I think that's one of the things that we've done that allows us to continue to be strong with pricing and with our products. And as it relates to overall wholesale growth, I don't know, Paul, if you want to talk about that from an EV perspective. Paul Jacobson : Yes. So on the EV growth, obviously, supply is going to increase throughout the year as we ramp up to the 200,000 to 300,000 units of production that we've talked about. Spring Hill is coming online in -- came online in Q1 and we're ramping up production pretty steadily and that's Ultium Cell plant too. And as module production kicks up, we see an exit rate that's significantly greater. Now of course, we're all going to be paced -- we're going to be paced by where the consumer is from that standpoint. Early indications are that the ramp is going well, and we should expect to see that consistently growing throughout the year. James Picariello : Got it. And then just to hit on the quarter's China JV losses. Is the expectation to see profitability the remainder of the year or could this take another quarter or two? And then for GMI consolidated, can you just shed any light on the profitability actions that are taking place in South America? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes, sure. So as China -- I think it's progressing as we articulated at the initial guidance range. We did trend slightly better than what we expected, but we foreshadowed the loss in Q1. We do expect that to reverse and be profitable for the rest of the year. And we said results that were similar to slightly down from last year in China. So the rest of the year is we'll have to manage it. But like I said, Q1 was a little bit ahead of expectations, but generally in line, so we'll be profitable. For the rest of GMI, we had some downtime in South America in particular. We're watching Argentina fairly closely as we continue to see the reforms that are going on there. But overall we see that improving from kind of where we were and not overly concerned about that just yet, but that's a market that we're continuing to watch. James Picariello : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. You may proceed. Alex, you may need to unmute your line. Alexander Potter : Yes. Hi. Can you hear me? Operator : We can hear you now. Mary Barra : Yes. Paul Jacobson : We got you, Alex. Alexander Potter : Okay. Very good. So first question on Ultium. You talked to the 200,000 to 300,000 production guidance, which is good to see. But at the same time, you talk about how you're going to use consumer demand as sort of a gating factor. Would you say that the 200,000 to 300,000, is that something that you're going to stick to sort of come hell or high water and then gauge consumer demand from there or is it something that you could slow walk maybe towards midyear toward the second half if it doesn't seem like the consumer demand is materializing? Mary Barra : We're never going to build -- just build products come hell or high water because the number is out there. We're always going to be responsive to the customer. But we do believe that we're going to be in that $200,000 to $300,000 range with the number of EVs that we have launching off of Ultium. We're seeing strength with HUMMER as we're ramping that up. We're seeing strength with LYRIQ and Blazer is just now ramping up. We've got the Equinox coming and there's several more. So I think when you look at the fact that these are all going to meet customers exactly with the performance and functionality that they need, we think we're well positioned there. So I would also say though as you look across our portfolio, we are well positioned, whether it's ICE or EV from a -- with the strength of our ICE portfolio. So we're well positioned to respond to the customer. Like I said, we are very focused on making sure that we don't overbuild, that we're able to maintain our price, our margins. And we think we've got the strength. And specifically, if you look at Spring Hill, we can build EV or ICE in that plant. So I think we're well positioned. We think we're going to be in the 200,000 to 300,000 range by customer demand, and we'll just continue to adapt. Alexander Potter : Okay. Perfect. And then second, we talked a little bit about competition within China. I'm interested in hearing sort of your updated views on competition from the Chinese outside China. What's, I guess, GM's stance on this? Do you think protectionism is necessary? Are you more of a free market sort of philosophy from a company standpoint, competing against the Chinese globally particularly in places like South America? Yeah, any comments on China. Thanks. Mary Barra : Yes. I think it's a great question. And first of all, I think in general, we want to have our best products. And if there's a level playing field, then it's -- we want to compete based on products. I think you have to look at where is there a level playing field, and what's happening around the world. But there's a lot that can happen from a regulatory or a trade perspective, but we're focused on is making sure we have great vehicles at the right price, so what is going to help GM maintain its share around the world. When you look at South America, the Chevy brand is incredibly strong. And we're going to continue to focus on having great designs with great product portfolio with the right features and functions, and we're constantly working on taking cost out of the system. So it's a -- there's value there as well. And that's the way we're going to compete around the world. But I think the focus has got to be on a level playing field. Alexander Potter : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Bruno Dossena : Hi. This is Bruno on for Rod. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to understand the key assumptions you're making in your EV margin outlook for positive contribution margins this year and positive overall margins next year. Based on the hints you've given us, we think you need to improve contribution margins per EV by like 10,000 to 15,000 in 2025 compared to '23. I think if I heard correctly, that's about in line with what you're seeing on the LYRIQ year-over-year. But if you could just help us understand the key buckets of lower cost and what's driving that and your underlying assumptions around pricing and costs. Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Good morning, Bruno. Thanks for the question. So if you go back to a presentation that we did back in November, we kind of highlighted the road map for 60 points of EBIT improvement in 2024 with about 60% of that driven by scale benefits. So if you think about where we are, we've invested a lot into the infrastructure, battery plants and manufacturing facilities, supply chain, et cetera, to ramp up production. So some of our EBIT losses are really driven by the fact that we need to grow into what we've built. And so that's about 60% of that 60 points improvement. The rest is really kind of split evenly between trims and launches and also material cost reductions. So we've gotten off to a good start as we've seen battery raw materials start to come into the cell costs this year. We've done a good job of reducing cell costs. And as we said, the LYRIQ is down $12,000 in cost year-over-year. So that's the type of progress that we expect. And then as we get into 2025, scale becomes a lower driver, and we get into more of material cost reductions in the vehicles that we're producing as they get out of their early years and we start to harness savings in each vehicle line in the second, third year of production, et cetera. So there's a pretty good road map there. Pricing, obviously, we're going to continue to watch and see where the market is. As we talked about, what we did on the Blazer was built into our expectations. So we're not changing off of those targets. And we're just a quarter in on the Ultium ramp, but the early indications are positive. Bruno Dossena : Okay. Thank you. And then just stepping back, we wonder if there's multiple paths to the EV losses that are currently being incurred eventually reversing. Specifically if the demand or pricing environment for these EVs is softer than expected, how much flexibility do you have to lower costs in the EV business, including as it relates to battery plans? I think your plans for 160 gigawatt hours eventually over 2 million units. Is there flexibility to rationalize that if the demand differs from your expectations? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Well, I think you've seen us take steps before. We had a delay in the Orion plant where we've really kind of taken advantage of some of the slowdown to put improvements into that plant that are going to help us lower the cost that came out of some of the early learnings from production at Factory ZERO and things that we can do going forward. So I think you're going to see us be very nimble. And we're trying to build as much flexibility as we can to navigate from here to significantly higher EV adoption going forward. But when you look at our portfolio across both an ICE, EV, it's probably the best portfolio in our history and customers are responding to that. So we're going to meet the customer where they are and continue to endeavor to exceed their expectations and really reward them for that loyalty that they have to us going forward. And we think that, that can translate into the EV market as well. But as Mary said, we're going to continue to be guided by demand for our products and our vehicles. And the early indications are that it's going quite well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open. Christopher McNally : Thanks so much team. Just wanted to dive into some of the questions on seasonality following on to some of Mark's questions prior. Paul, could you talk about the seasonality in wholesale? I think you've talked about full year being up sort of mid-single-digits, which would imply somewhere in the low to mid-800,000 range for the rest of the year. But if you could just help us with just a little bit of the cadence, given some of the downtime you mentioned in Q2. Paul Jacobson : Yes. There was probably a little bit of pull forward from Q1 to Q2, particularly with the trucks as we prep for that downtime and that retooling that's going to happen for a few weeks. But generally, seasonality, we expect to be very similar with Q1 and Q4 being slightly lower than Q2 and Q3. So nothing has dramatically changed. But around the edges, maybe a little bit of pull forward from Q2 into Q1. So as we look at the second half, I just want to caution that we've got to continue to be guided by the assumption that's in there on pricing, which obviously has a bigger second half impact, given the performance that we've already booked in Q1 and certainly where April is looking right now. And then with the EV volume ratcheting up in the back half, that's where we see a little bit of front half loading in the guidance that we've provided. Christopher McNally : Perfect. All makes sense. And then maybe just on the actual production side, should we think of sort of truck T1 production as maybe at a tight end in Q1? Do we get back to this level in Q4, just looking at the overall yield and inventory build? Paul Jacobson : I think that, obviously, we're going to continue to watch demand where it is. The inventory, while we built in March, we're still -- we came out of the quarter about 63 days of inventory across the system. So some of that was intentional knowing that we were going to have this downtime. So once we get through that, I think we could see third quarter production trend a little bit higher, but we're going to be guided by where demand sits. Christopher McNally : Okay. Great. Thanks so much team. Mary Barra : Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Good morning. Thanks for all the detail on your planned upcoming BEV launches in the US. It does seem likely you will gain share there with the number and attractiveness of the offerings. I'm curious if you have a similarly aggressive EV rollout strategy planned for China, including because it seems your share in China has declined amidst the industry transition there to EVs. I heard you citing earlier the increased competitiveness of the domestic Chinese automakers as another contributing factor. And there may be still other factors. But would a blitz of new EVs be sufficient? Do you think at this stage to stabilize the share trend in China? Do you have such a blitz planned over the next one to two years? And would that be a pathway to improved financial performance or given some of the recent pricing trends represent maybe more of an investment with the payoff some years further out? Mary Barra : Yes. I think we do have, I think, some strong NEVs coming in China this year. We're repositioning the Buick Velite. We've got the Cadillac OPTIQ launch coming. You'll see that at the Beijing Auto Show. And we also have PHEV entries in the Buick GL8 and the Equinox. And then for our ICE vehicles, we do also have like, for instance, a lead with the GL8 and there'll be more upgrades coming there as well. So -- and then on SGM, we're also -- we have a new -- excuse me new NEV launches as well. So I think we're going to be better positioned and that's just going to continue as we move through this year into next year. And that's why I think we can play in the NEV market both plug-in hybrids, hybrids and ICE vehicles as well as EVs. And then, as I mentioned, with the Durant Guild in the niche segment. So I think there's a place for GM to play and grow share. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. Thanks. And with all these questions about the new vehicle operations in China, maybe just highlight some of the attractiveness if it is that you can draw from the installed base of vehicles there, the OnStar, the financing, sales service, GM Goodwrench and sort of how do you feel about that element of the China business? Mary Barra : Well, you mentioned all of the things that come together to allow us to be successful in the market. But I would say one of the other things is last year, we also established in China dedicated software and digital business organization. And that is going to allow us to continue to improve and compete on a software basis and also on a services basis, along with what we have from a GMF perspective, financing as well as OnStar. So we'll continue to build that. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open. Tom Narayan : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Paul, just a follow-up on that comment on the EV margin. So 60% of the 60 basis point improvement is coming from scale benefits. So if BEVs were kind of closer, let's say, to the 200,000 versus the 300,000, is that a net negative or positive to overall margins? Presumably BEVs come at lower margins, but if you're selling a few of them, then there's a negative impact from less scale benefit. So just trying to understand that like how do we think about that volume number impact to the company's margins. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Good morning, Tom. What I would say is that, obviously, based on just where we are in the journey, scale matters quite a bit when you built the infrastructure that we have. So certainly, in the short run, lower volume would have a negative effect on that trajectory. But I think what we're looking at is kind of breakeven on the variable profit side around low 200,000. So we still are tracking to be able to get that goal. But I look at that as more of a little bit of timing of when we grow into what we've built. And I think from a strategic perspective, growing capacity slightly ahead of adoption to make sure that we can pace and meter ourselves on this journey. Remember, we're playing a 10, 15-year plus game from that standpoint. So we've built the flexibility in to be able to respond to ebbs and flows. And we're at a phase right now where we've got to grow into that scale we've built. But those are all really, really sound investments. And we feel good about where that's going to go in the short to intermediate term. And then we're going to continue to watch that going forward. Tom Narayan : Thanks. And a quick follow-up. On the battery raws, obviously, we've seen lithium down like something like 80% or since the peaks. Just curious how your contracts work. When -- have we seen the best of that reduction or is there -- is kind of a lag where you see the -- is there more benefits to come given the lag in your battery raw mat contracts? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : So what I would say is there's still some goodness to come in '24. So while we saw battery costs come down, remember, we exited the year with a pretty sizable inventory of cells as we ramp up our module production. So as a result of that, there's still some historical costs in there from last year. But that will flip pretty much, I think, by the time we get to mid-summer. And in the second half of the year, we'll see cells that have much closer to current prices. And then as you look at kind of vertical integration and investment steps that we made, most of that capacity is in 2026 and beyond. There isn't anything that we've done that I would say we regret because we locked in higher prices et cetera. Everything that we've done has been done with a portfolio approach to make sure that we get value for our investment either through floors and caps or discounts to market et cetera. So we haven't done anything that would have locked in sort of historically high prices. And that should be a benefit for us as we roll forward into 2026 and beyond. Tom Narayan : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra with her closing comments. Mary Barra : Thank you, and thanks, everyone, for your question. As we've talked today, we are making extremely good progress across the board. We're driving revenue growth. We've got great margins, our free cash flow is strong, and that's enabling us to reinvest in the business and our employees. So we plan to efficiently invest between $10.5 billion and $11.5 billion in capital this year to leverage the strength of not only our ICE business but also grow our EV business profitably. And we're also advancing our software-defined vehicle capability. So I feel very good about the key areas of focus and how we're doing there. In addition, we've set aside more than $160 million in profit sharing for the first quarter to recognize the contributions of the manufacturing team members in the US, which were significant, both in terms of production volumes and quality. And our shareholders are also benefiting from the progress too, thanks to our improved execution, a higher dividend and the value-enhancing benefits of the ASR we launched in November. We are on track to reduce our shares outstanding to fewer than 1 billion. So I can say to everyone with confidence and conviction that our team is very much on point. We're focused and we're going to do everything in our power to keep this momentum going. 2024 can be a very strong year for GM. So thank you all for your time. Operator : That concludes the conference for today. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, July 23, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the second quarter of 2024. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's investor relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the Safe Harbor Statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin today's call by thanking the GM team, as well as our dealers, suppliers, and other business partners, for helping us deliver strong second quarter and first-half results, including record revenue in both periods. There are four key drivers to our performance and our new hire guidance that I'd like to highlight. First, our past investments have created a consistently high-performing portfolio of ICE trucks and SUVs from a volume, share, and margin standpoint. Next, our EV portfolio is scaling well and gaining market share. In fact, our U.S. EV deliveries grew 40% year-over-year in the second quarter, while the industry grew at 11%. We're encouraged by these early results because disciplined volume growth is key to earning positive variable profits from our EV portfolio in the fourth quarter and maintaining strong ICE margins. Third, we continue to deliver stable pricing and our incentives on average have been more than 100 basis points below the industry average for four consecutive quarters. And finally, with our new investments, we have even greater focus on margins and capital efficiency. Great vehicles and better execution will continue to differentiate us. In the first-half, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra volumes in the U.S. were up a combined 5% versus a year ago, and we gained 3.5 points of market share with disciplined production and consistent pricing. In addition, sales of our redesigned Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon mid-sized pickups were up 31% year-over-year with ATPs up 9%. And SUVs were executing a full court press with eight all new redesigned compact, mid-size and full size models that began arriving in showrooms during the second quarter. They include some of our most profitable nameplates, like the Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia, and the Buick Enclave, which will be available with Super Cruise for the first time. We designed Super Cruise to let customers drive hands-free for hours at a time on far more roads and with far fewer disengagements. Road testers at Edmunds.com rated Super Cruise the top hands-free driving system because it's confidence-inspiring, and its technical differences between our system and others explain why Super Cruise is so smooth. The Chevrolet Equinox, our highest volume SUV, will also be all new, and we expect it to be more profitable than the outgoing model, just like our family of mid-size Buick, GMC, and Chevrolet SUVs. This is a function of several strategic decisions we've made. First, the styling is bolder and more truck-like for the Chevrolet's and GMC's, while the Buick Enclave adopts the brand's sophisticated new design language. Next, we elevated the comfort and technology features to make them even more desirable. Then we leveraged our proven platforms and component sets for lower cost and greater efficiency. Winning with simplicity, which is our drive to eliminate unnecessary complexity in the way we engineer and equip our vehicles, will help ensure that we can continue to sustain and even improve our margins in the future. For example, through smarter contenting and optimizing selectable options, we have been able to eliminate more than 2,400 unique parts on 10 vehicles we're launching through the first quarter of 2025. On the 2025 Cadillac LYRIQ alone, we've reduced the part count 24% from the 2024 model year with no compromises to performance or features. The list of parts or subsystems that we no longer need to design, engineer, source, install, and warehouse is extensive and includes complex and relatively costly seat assemblies, consoles, door trims, and [fascias] (ph). A crucial element is reducing the number of buildable electrical combinations, which is delivering hardware and software quality improvements as well as savings. The work is helping us meet our $2 billion fixed cost reduction program this year and the savings will be even greater in the future. As I said before our EV portfolio is growing faster than the market now that our module issues are resolved and we are scaling production. Our early sales are mostly incremental about 54% of customers are new to GM and we're working to increase our conquest rate by raising awareness and launching new models. Our best-selling EV so far this year is the Cadillac LYRIQ and it is now the market leading luxury EV in 22 states including Florida, Texas, and Michigan. The GMC Hummer EV and the Chevrolet Blazer EV are also building momentum. To unleash the next cycle of EV growth we're scaling production of the Chevrolet Equinox EV with its unique combination of performance, technology, range, and affordability. We delivered our first 1,000 units late in the second quarter and the reaction from customers, dealers, and the media is very strong. One product reviewer said, Chevy seems positioned to grab a piece of the pie that no one else has quite grabbed onto yet, and we think that is spot on. Then over the next several months, GMC will launch the Sierra EV, and the Cadillac LYRIQ will be joined by the OPTIQ, Escalade IQ and CELESTIQ. We're especially excited about the OPTIQ. Car and driver said it nails the compact luxury SUV formula. Then next year, when we follow with the CELESTIQ, Cadillac will have a beautifully designed EV in every global luxury SUV segment. We're going to focus on winning new customers with these nameplates, as well as with the next generation Chevrolet Bolt EV because they represent the largest growth opportunities for us. But we've also made adjustments to ensure we have a balanced approach as the market develops. This includes deferring Buick's first EV which had been planned for 2024. As we're expanding choice, other barriers to EV adoption like public charging access are also improving. We are working to finalize commercial agreements with Tesla to give our customers access to their charging network. The IONNA fast charging venture we joined is expected to bring its first chargers online before the end of the year, and customers are telling us the drive-through plazas we're rolling out with Pilot company are the best public charging experience out there. As excited as we are about our portfolio, we are committed to growing responsibly and profitably in any demand environment. Over the next few years, third-party forecasters now see the EV market growing steadily, but more slowly than it did over the last few years. As a result, we are adjusting our spending plans to make sure we're capital efficient and moving in lockstep with customers. For example, our Altium cells joint venture continues to ramp up domestic battery cell supply this year, which is helping drive profit improvement in our EV portfolio. As we go forward, we're going to bring additional capacity online in a measured cadence. This will enable us to better optimize our battery chemistry and form factors to meet our customers' needs on cost and range. We've also decided to reopen the Orion assembly as a battery electric truck plant in mid-2026. The new timing is six months later than our plan heading into the year. We're confident that we can meet customer demand for standout EV trucks in the interim by leveraging the production capability and flexibility we have in factory zero. We will also continue to take advantage of the flexibility we have to mix production between ICE and EV at key plants. Next I'd like to discuss our results in China. As you know, the market has significant excess capacity, and many startups and established competitors continue to prioritize production over profitability. We have been taking steps to reduce our inventory, align our production to demand, protect our pricing and reduce fixed costs. But it's clear the steps we have taken, while significant, have not been enough. We had expected to return to profitability in China in the second quarter. However, we reported a loss and we expect the rest of the year will remain challenging, because the headwinds are not easy. We are working closely with our JV partner to restructure the business to make it profitable and sustainable. I'll close my opening comments by recognizing the progress Cruise has made over the last several months. As you know, Cruise has returned to the road in Houston, Phoenix, and Dallas, and we recently provided them with bridge financing to support their operational cash needs. We've also made several significant leadership appointments, including hiring Marc Whitten as CEO. Mark has decades of experience on the front lines of technology transformations, which will be crucial as we move forward. Our vision to transform mobility using autonomous technology is unchanged. And every mile traveled and every simulation brings us closer, because Cruise is an AI first company. We have some of the best engineers in tech building a cutting edge AI platform, harnessing the power of large scale foundation models to continuously improve safe AV performance. The Cruise team will also simplify their path to scale by focusing their next autonomous vehicle on the next generation Chevrolet Bolt EV instead of the Origin. It's a win-win for both GM and Cruise. It addresses the regulatory uncertainty we face with the Origin, because of its unique design. Per unit costs will be much lower, which will help Cruise optimize resources and enable them to deliver AV tech at scale as quickly as possible. And the change will help GM fully leverage our investment in the Bolt EV with a major new customer for the product. We think all of these are important steps that will help us attract those who believe in the Cruise mission and see the incredible long-term business opportunity of autonomous driving. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul to walk you through our financial results. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning. Our second quarter results were driven by ongoing strong performance from our ICE business and stable pricing across the portfolio that once again outperformed our guidance assumptions for the quarter. And I'm pleased to share that pricing has remained relatively consistent thus far into July. As Mary mentioned, sales have been robust. We launched our new mid-sized SUVs supporting stable pricing and generating stronger profit margins than preceding models. Highlighting our focus on profitable growth, recent JD Power data showed that our U.S. Incentive GAAP compared to the industry average is expanding. In the second quarter we ran roughly 150 basis points below the industry. While at the same time our U.S. retail market share increased by 70 basis points, more than offsetting the lower fleet volume to rental companies. Our EV portfolio is gaining momentum. In the second quarter, our U.S. EV deliveries were up 34% sequentially from the first quarter, driven by the Chevrolet Blazer EV and the Cadillac LYRIQ. And moving forward, we'll also benefit from the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which delivers more than 300 miles of range and will be sub $30,000 after factoring in the consumer tax credit. On capital allocation, we repurchased $1 billion of stock in the quarter, retiring another 22 million shares. And in early July, completed the prior $5 billion stock authorization. We ended the quarter with a fully diluted share count of $1.14 billion, a reduction of 18% from a year ago. The open market share repurchases supplement the ongoing $10 billion ASR that is projected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year, bringing our share count down to 1.1 billion. As a reminder, on the ASR, we paid the $10 billion upfront in December of last year and immediately retired 215 million shares. In the first quarter, the first tranche was completed and we retired another 4 million shares. In the second quarter, no additional shares were retired under the ASR as the banks continued to cover their positions in the 215 million shares they borrowed at the outset of the program. In the fourth quarter, we expect to retire another 20 million to 30 million shares depending on several factors, including the average share price during that period, bringing the total number of shares retired under the ASR to around 250 million. On top of these measures, last month the board authorized an additional $6 billion for share repurchases. Considering our belief that GM's share price is still undervalued, you should expect us to remain active in future share repurchases, continuing the great progress we have made towards our goal of driving our share count below 1 billion outstanding. Getting into the second quarter results, revenue was up 7% to $48 billion driven by higher wholesale volumes and stable pricing in North America. We achieved $4.4 billion in EBIT adjusted, 9.3% EBIT adjusted margins, and $3.06 in EPS diluted adjusted. Recall that in 2023 we had inventory valuation adjustments of $1.7 billion for battery cell and EV finished goods inventory. We expected the allowance to be substantially lower in 2024 as we improve EV profitability and reduce our inventory levels. We made good progress in these areas during the second quarter and therefore reduced about $300 million of the allowance. And our guidance includes a similar benefit in both the third and fourth quarters, totaling around a $1 billion benefit for the full-year. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $5.3 billion during the second quarter, similar to last year and driven by our strong core operating performance coupled with our capital discipline. North America delivered second quarter EBIT adjusted margins of 10.9%, which resulted in $4.4 billion of EBIT adjusted, up $1.2 billion year-over-year. This was driven by higher wholesale volumes, stable pricing, ongoing cost containment, EV valuation allowance benefit, and a non-recurrence of the $700 million LG expense that we took last year. Pricing for the quarter was up $300 million year-over-year and better than what we assumed in our guidance, supported by new products like the Chevrolet Traverse. Moreover, our HD pickups and full-size SUVs continue to drive robust demand, while maintaining low incentives. We also benefited from our fixed cost reduction program, realizing $100 million from lower marketing spend, compared to last year. We remain on track to achieve $2 billion of net fixed cost savings by the end of 2024. Dealer inventory levels ended the quarter at 66 days. This is temporarily above where we were tracking earlier in June, as we believe some sales for dealers using the CDK platform were delayed until the third quarter. We will continue to monitor our inventory and adjust production as necessary to maintain our targeted inventory levels of 50 days to 60 days. GM International second quarter EBIT adjusted was $50 million, down $200 million year-over-year. China equity income was a loss of $100 million, down $200 million year-over-year. Mary already touched on the difficult China market and the immediate steps we have taken with our JV partner to return it to profitability as soon as possible. EBIT adjusted in GM International excluding China equity income was $150 million, flat year-over-year, but improved more than $50 million sequentially from the first quarter. GM Financial has consistently performed well with second quarter EBT adjusted of $800 million, up $50 million year-over-year and tracking in the range of $2.75 billion to $3 billion for the full-year. They continued to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter. Cruise expenses were $450 million in the quarter, down $150 million from a year ago, reflecting a reduction in operational activities and a technology improvement focus intended to meet the high performance bar expected for AVs. We're very conscious of spend while at the same time efficiently expanding operations across Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston. In addition, Mary explained how utilizing the next generation of the Chevrolet Bolt EV will aid in scaling our robo-taxi business to create a more cost-effective and scalable option. However, the decision to pause the production of Cruise, Origin triggered a charge of roughly $600 million, which we recorded as a special item in the second quarter. Let's move now to our updated guidance. Given the positive momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising full-year 2024 guidance to EBIT adjusted in the $13 billion to $15 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $9.50 to $10.50 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $9.5 billion to $11.5 billion range. Our cash flow guidance increases larger than our EBIT increase, primarily due to production alignment to market demand and further working capital benefits over the balance of the year. I'd also like to address why the implied second-half EBIT adjusted is around $2.5 billion lower at the midpoint of our guidance range, compared to the first-half. There are three main reasons. First, we are assuming a bigger pricing headwind. Our guidance assumes pricing to be down 1% to 1.5 year-over-year in the second-half versus essentially flat in the first-half, which is a substantial improvement from where we started the year. Second, roughly $1 billion of costs are second-half weighted. This includes about $400 million higher marketing spend to support more launches in the back half of the year. The remainder is related to higher commodity prices, particularly copper and aluminum, and the timing of other EV costs, which we do not anticipate to be ongoing. Third, EV volumes are expected to build sequentially every quarter to achieve our full-year target of 200,000 to 250,000. We produced and wholesale 75,000 GM Ultium EVs in the first-half of the year, and expect this number to accelerate as we launch and ramp our new vehicles. As a result, mix will be a bigger headwind in the back half of the year, as EVs have a variable profit lower than the portfolio average. We continue to monitor EV demand and inventory levels very closely. We acknowledge that Ultium wholesales outpaced customer deliveries by about 2% to 1% for the first-half of the year. This however is common when introducing a new vehicle given the need to build availability, options, and customer awareness. As time goes on, if customer deliveries were to continue lagging wholesales, we will take proactive steps to balance production levels. The last item on EVs is that I'm pleased to report that we are making good progress towards achieving vehicle variable profit on our EV portfolio in the fourth quarter. Key drivers to reach this goal include improved manufacturing scale and efficiencies, including module and pack assembly; reduce cell costs from improved scale and performance at our Ultium cells JV, including working through our inventory of cells produced with higher battery raw materials. This has helped reduce our average cell cost by roughly $30 a kilowatt hour, sequentially from the first quarter, and we expect further improvements in the second-half of the year. And finally, improved vehicle mix as we scale our electric full-size trucks and SUVs. In closing, we are committed to maintaining the strong financial performance we accomplished in the first-half of the year and consistently adhering to our capital allocation framework. It is underpinned by a focus on cost containment, capital efficiency, and agility in navigating the complexities of our business. We are differentiating ourselves from our peers with superior product offerings and improving execution. We are market leaders in the truck and full-size SUV segments. Growing market share in affordable SUVs and our refreshed mid-size SUVs are some of the fastest growing vehicles in the segment, while yielding higher profitability than the preceding models. At the same time, we are growing and improving profitability on our EV portfolio, along with developing a world class software organization and making steady progress at Cruise. As always, our customers and their safety will be at the center of everything we do and is fundamental to our continued success. This concludes our opening comments and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start first with a question on pricing. If you could just provide a bit of context on the pricing strength we've seen, not only in 2Q, but in 1Q, if you just look at the incentives, the incentives are clearly up, but your pricing has actually been net flat, any color behind this? And then maybe you could just talk to the sustainability of this in light of the fact that we've seen some inventory normalization, but prices held in, do you view this price as sustainable beyond this year, factoring in that there is going to be some increase in incentives as inventory ticks up further from here? Paul Jacobson : Yes, good morning, Dan. Thanks for the question, first of all. So what I would say is that obviously we've been very disciplined about our commercial strategy in going to market, and despite the fact that we've seen a little bit of pressure year-over-year on incentives, we've actually widened the gap in the quarter against our competitive set. So demand for our vehicles is strong. I think some of the offsets are our truck sales were up 5% in the quarter where we continue to pick up share. And that's helped to offset some of the lower ATP vehicles and we've seen in the growth in the tracks, for example. So I think we've been saying for a long time that our consumer has held up really well and it's been resilient. And we expect that to continue to be the same way. I think a big part of that is the strategy that we've undertaken about being very disciplined in inventory and the more data flow about producing the vehicles that we know that customers are demanding. And when you combine that with the incredibly strong portfolio we have, I think this is the result. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. And a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your EV strategy, and this is in light of maybe some of the potential changes we may be seeing in the regulatory environment given the upcoming election. You know there is obviously one candidate in the U.S. Presidential election, who talked about pulling back the EV mandate and maybe there's some implications on things like IRA or EPA mandates? So to what extent, if we see pullback in some of these standards, does that modify your EV strategy? Is your EV strategy one that is, you know, driven more by regulations? Or do you view your EV strategy as a bit more fixed given the long-term strategic goals of GM and also just the longer planning cycles for products. Mary Barra : So thanks for the question. Our strategy is to offer our consumers choice. We've got an incredible portfolio of vehicles, both EV and ICE, and we've got flexibility. So we know we can win more customers as they embrace EVs. We're seeing that right now with 54% of the EV sales being customers that are new to GM. And so we do think the market for EVs will continue to grow and we've got the performance, the technology and the range that customers want, especially when you look at our portfolio with the Equinox coming out right now, the affordability of that vehicle along with when we have the Bolt next year, if we're giving consumers that choice. And as I've said, EVs are fun to drive, instant torque. I think our EVs have beautiful designs, the right range, the right performance. So again, we'll be guided by the consumer and regardless of what the regulatory environment is, regardless we're going to work to maximize, because we've got that flexibility between ICE and EV. So I think we're in a very strong position. I think we also have to look at though, the investments GMs made in EVs, we're creating 1,000s of jobs all over the country including Ohio, Michigan, and Tennessee. So I'm pleased with where our strategy is. I think regardless of what happens from a regulatory perspective, we're going to be well positioned with our ICE and with our EV portfolio. Dan Levy : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter. Maybe a first question for Paul back on the second-half, and thank you for the color. On the 1%, 1.5% negative pricing assumption, how does it compare to what you're assuming for the industry in the second-half? And also, how should we think about the high level sensitivity to EV volume target second-half of the year? The volumes that come in lower, I think about the puts and takes in the model for that? And secondly, maybe for Mary, on Cruise, how do you think about strategically taking Cruise to market as a ride share operator, as opposed to maybe finding partners to deploy on the next generation boat? Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Itay. I'll go ahead and start with the first questions. On the second-half, we tend to stay very, very focused on what we see for pricing for ourselves. Obviously, there's a lot of noise going on with different incentive strategies, different inventory levels, et cetera. So that's an assumption that we bake in based on what we're seeing in the market and making sure that we're projecting the right amount of conservatism against our cash flow targets and plans. So we started the year saying down 2% to 2%. We got through the first-half of the year essentially flat. And what I would say is July to-date looks very similar to June. So we're going continue to push through month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter on the portfolio that works for us. So we've managed to do that through various incentive strategies and various inventory pushes that we've seen from our competitors. And we're going to just be focused on meeting our customer demand the best way we can. Mary Barra : And Itay on -- as it relates to Cruise, we've worked very hard. As you look at what's happening with artificial intelligence applications across many industries, customers have an expectation of higher performance from technology than they necessarily do in our case for other human beings. And so our target now instead of being better than average driver is to be better than a role model driver. And tremendous work has gone on over the last few months. So as we are rolling out now in the three cities I mentioned, the technology is much more advanced to be better than a role model driver. We've also expanded our safety metrics to make sure it measures across many scenarios. So I'm very confident as we now have vehicles operating and we're on the path very quickly to get to -- back to driverless with much safer technology, again, getting to this better than a role model driver. So when I look at that, we can provide an exceptional driver experience as we continue to grow. Now when you talk about what is the right balance between expansion, capital demands and partners and/or investors, we're very open, and we're seeing significant interest in Cruise. So as we move into this next phase, we're going to be looking at what's the right efficient way to go forward with Cruise from a robo-taxi business from a Cruise perspective. But also we are seeing very laser-focused on the personal autonomous vehicle opportunity for GM. So we think we're well positioned. We'll share more as we go through the year, but we have significant outside interest from a partner and investor perspective. Itay Michaeli : Perfect. That's all very helpful. Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Itay, let me just go back. I think I missed the second part of your question on the sensitivity to EV volume from that. So you saw when our -- we originally gave our guide on production, we were at 200,000 to 300,000. We talked about being able to get to variable profit positive in the low 200,000. We're still holding to that, although with the 200 to 250, we pulled that from the second-half to the fourth quarter. So I know it doesn't give you a specific answer, but directionally, obviously, scale is a big part of what we're doing. A lot of the battery costs, cell cost improvement that we've seen has just been driven by efficiency and scale at the plant. So it's something that we continue to watch, and we're continuing to strive for it. But nothing more specific than that. Itay Michaeli : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Paul, thanks for all the additional color on cost and back half. I guess to counter some of those higher costs you mentioned, right, you still have the fixed cost savings program, you're on track for the $2 billion. If we're sort of tracking this, it looks like you did maybe $1 billion last year and maybe $400 million in the first-half, so another $600 million in the back half. I just want to make sure that's sort of ballpark correct? And if it is, just maybe some color on why it's actually accelerating or higher because I think like if we think about last year, the costs also were more back-end loaded. So it's sort of a tougher comp. So what else is being done here to drive the cost savings higher? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Good morning, Joe. Thanks for the question. So I would say directionally, your math is pretty accurate on about the $1.4 billion of the $2 billion. I would look at the biggest cost increase that we highlighted on the call is about $400 million of marketing spend, and that is first-half to second-half. So marketing spend overall is still down significantly, and the team has done a great job of driving more efficiency into what we're doing. But obviously, with the launches that we have in the second half of the year, there's a significant lean in to drive that customer awareness. And we think that's actually an opportunity for us to help us scale and to help us see us outside share gains in EV. So I would say it's timing within the larger pool of significant savings initiatives out of that category. That's the biggest piece of it. But we're continuing to work on it. And we believe that we'll be successful in that $2 billion cost reduction target that we laid out, and we're not going to stop there. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thanks for that first-half, second-half clarification on the marketing. And then, Mary, just on the Origin decision, obviously, some cost savings. But I guess, is there also -- and I know I think you're still undergoing the strategic review for Cruise. But does this also indicate a change in go-to-market strategy and sort of not having that purpose-built vehicle? Like what were some of the other considerations? Is sharing just not really, you think, viable for that business model? Or are there other use cases versus what you're originally planning for? Mary Barra : I think the main reason is with going -- switching from the Origin to the Bolt is we extinguished the regulatory risk. Remember, because the Origin doesn't have steering wheels and some other motor vehicle safety standard components, it doesn't meet motor vehicle safety standards. There's -- that requires a legislative change. We've been working on that. It's been difficult to get done. And with that, if we don't get that legislative change or authorization from a government perspective, we're limited in the number of Origins we could put out. So as we looked at this, we thought it was better to get rid of that risk. And then when we look at the Bolt, it's been, I think, a very good product for the initial rollout from an AV perspective where we have over 5 million miles traveled. And it allows us to be more capital efficient and get better scale on the Bolt EV as we roll out next year based on the LTM platform. So I would say it was mainly driven by the uncertainty that we have from a regulatory perspective. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Roeska with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Daniel Roeska : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions, Dan from Bernstein. Maybe following on, on the EV questions we've had. Could you elaborate a bit on your outlook for emissions compliance? Kind of if we stay within the current EPA framework, kind of what level of drivetrain mix credit would you expect to need to have to achieve the 2027 target? And then following on from Dan's question earlier, if any administration or either administration should decide to revisit the EPA targets, could you outline what you would expect, what the timeline would be to actually be effective for 2027? So what is the latest point in time when an administration then EPA would need to kick off kind of that process to revisit the 2027 target? Thanks. Mary Barra : Sure. Well, for General Motors to comply with the existing regulations, we have many levers that we can pull, including how we plan our portfolio, the technology that we use on the vehicles. We can utilize credits from prior and future model years and purchase credits as well as have a robust EV portfolio. And so we look at this on a regular basis based on what's happening with EV adoption, what's based on what's happening with the regs and make those decisions. So it's something we have a lot of flexibility. And obviously, we intend to meet the regulatory environment. It's really hard for me to predict what the timeline would be if something is going to change. I would though that we just -- we look at our portfolio on a regular basis with not only what we know the regs to be and make sure we have a plan there. And then we do scenario planning for what potentially could happen, and then we have that range of opportunities. So we'll continue with that process. I mean if you think about it for the last several years, the regulatory environment has not been certain. I would say what's really important to the company overall is to have regulatory certainty. And so we'll be watching with interest as we get past the election and look at what the regs will be if they change at all. But I think we have the flexibility to moderate based on what we see. Daniel Roeska : Thanks, Mary. And maybe following up, if the regulations for 2027 kind of stay as they are right now with a more ambitious path, what role could mild or full hybrids kind of play in your portfolio? And if they stay as ambitious as they are right now, would you consider to kind of increase your focus on hybrid drivetrains in the U.S.? Mary Barra : Well, as we've said, we plan to have hybrids in key segments, not across the board, but in key segments in the 2027 time frame because of where the regulatory environment looks to be right now. So we have that opportunity. We can decide what we put on the fleet or what segments we put based on where we see the regulatory environment. So that's definitely one of the technologies that we can leverage. And as we've already said, we plan to have hybrids in key segments in the '27 time frame. Daniel Roeska : Great, thanks for confirming that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, there's the strong performance in North America that is the driver of the total company results. Certainly, congrats on that. I do think to ask, though, on the performance in China, including after it was a little surprising to see the equity loss fairly consistent with 1Q despite a solid rebound in both wholesales and non-consolidated revenue. I know you don't provide a detailed bridge for the nonconsolidated ops specifically. But from the sequential volume change, it would seem to imply in either price or mix or cost headwind quarter-over-quarter. I'm guessing price, given some of the comments from other automakers in that country, but perhaps you can fill us in there? And then I'm not sure if you're able to comment on what actions might be being considered in connection with your partner, but should we expect more that you are readying a portfolio of vehicles, maybe NEVs that you expect could gain greater traction? Or are you contemplating more rightsizing actions or some combination? And if you were to undertake rightsizing actions, I can't really remember you reducing capacity in that country before, at least not structurally. So perhaps you could update us on what kind of flexibility you might have in that market to take capacity out. How does it compare to North America today, for example, or maybe to Europe in the past when you operated in that region? Mary Barra : Yes. First off, we continue to see the challenges in China. Very few people are making money, and a lot of OEMs are prioritizing production over profitability. So I think the work that we have been more disciplined than most in our pricing. We are launching some new vehicles that we're seeing positive traction. But it's a difficult market right now. And frankly, it's unsustainable, because the amount of companies losing money there cannot continue indefinitely. And really, when you get into the type of pricing war that's going on now, it's really a race to the bottom and destroy residuals. There's nothing good that comes from the behavior that we're seeing right now. Having said that, we are taking -- we've taken several steps of getting our inventory right, launching some products that we think are going to be better received in some of the NEVs we had a couple of years ago, especially hybrids and full electric. And then as it relates to the work that we're doing with our partner, out of respect for our partnership, we'll provide more details as the decision is made. But I'm not going to go into detail of all the different items that we're contemplating. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Thank you. And maybe you could comment quickly, too, on the trends in your other international operations, including in the consolidated operations in Korea and Brazil to. I'm curious on the trend there. Thank you. Mary Barra : When you say the trend, you're talking about -- can you say a little bit more what your specific -- specifically... Ryan Brinkman : The trend in the profitability in those markets for you? Mary Barra : I would say in our GM International markets outside of China, we're seeing strong pricing. If you look at South America, for example, Chevy is considered a premium or luxury brand. And we've got a really strong portfolio with great brand loyalty and brand recognition. And we're seeing -- we're able to hold pricing and compete, by the way, because of the value of the Chevrolet-branded products. Again, in different -- we're seeing that across to varying levels across all of the international markets. So again, disciplined execution pays off over the longer period, and this is a long game that we play when we look at managing our brand strength, managing the residuals of our products, et cetera. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Ives with Wedbush. Your line is open. Dan Ives : Yes, thanks. I have a question with -- when you think about new GM customers looking at EVs, and that trend has been high, is that something that you expect to continue or maybe even could accelerate depending on the models and the price points when you look out the next, call, one to two years? Mary Barra : Absolutely, Dan. I believe when you look at the portfolio entries that we have coming, the fact that we have fresh designs, the performance and technology on these vehicles, along with the range is right. So for those that are already EV and tenders that might want to replace the existing EV they have, I mean, the response we're getting from dealers about the new Equinox EV is just outstanding when they say they look at the design of the vehicle, the performance and the affordability, especially with the consumer tax credit. So I think we have an opportunity to continue to outperform where the industry is, and we're going to look to build on that because we really believe in our portfolio. That's why we're spending the marketing dollars to make sure we get the awareness, and our dealers are excited. So I feel like we're well positioned to continue that growth. Dan Ives : Great, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning everybody. I just wanted to follow-up on pricing. And Paul, I mean, you guys updated your guidance and a little bit optimistic -- more optimistic about what's going on in the second half and you had been full-year and had good performance in the first-half? But as we think about pricing, there's two components that are, I think, being left out of the equation. I mean the first is over the last two years, we've seen a 400 basis point increase in loan rates, right? Dumb guys math on $50,000 ATP, that's $2,000 a year, four-year ownership cycle, it's $8,000 headwind to your consumer. And you have dealers earning twice as much as they did in 2019 now. So they have $2,000 to kind of potentially throw in to the equation to help get deals done. So there's -- as rates come down and dealers get more realistic about what they can earn on your vehicles, I mean, is there a lot of room to support pricing where it is and potentially God forbid as rates come down, pricing to go up, right? I think everybody kind of has this view that it's going to fade, but it might be much more resilient and stronger over the next year or two than people are expecting. What's your take on sort of those two points? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks, John. What I would say is it starts with the portfolio. When you look at the refreshes that we've done and what we brought to market and what's still come with the midsize SUVs, I think the team has done really an incredible job. And that's actually held up quite well even as we went to higher interest rates. And despite the fact that payments have gone up, we've seen demand hold pretty steady across the board. So we want to maintain some level of consistency, which is make sure that we approach the plan, the forward calendar with a little bit of conservatism on the pricing side versus what we're seeing in the market today because that's -- it's really all about continuity on cash flow and margin performance. So I think it's a strategy that's worked well for us. Like I said, despite the fact that we've taken that assumption down in the back half of the year from where we started the year, we're still not seeing that in the month of July to date. So I think this helps us be more nimble, be more agile and look around corners. But our commercial team is doing a really good job of go-to-market strategies and really looking at it on a month-by-month, product-by-product basis to drive our optimal margin performance. John Murphy : So we really should think about this as a planning assumption as opposed to an actual forecast. Is that a fair statement? Paul Jacobson : Yes. That's the way we've consistently referred to it. John Murphy : Okay. And then just one follow-up. CAPU when we look at your tables, I always ask about this, is 108% in North America, two-shifts straight time. God forbid, we saw an actual increase in unit volume, up 5% to 10% for you and maybe the industry alike? What kind of cost would flow back into the system? Will we be thinking about mostly variable costs? I mean, I see with that high CAPU, you might think that you might have a little bit of fixed cost that could come in as well. But I'm just curious how you would think about that cost flow if we got a real volume lift of up 5% to 10%. Mary Barra : Well, first of all, we'd be very excited about that because I think it's a huge opportunity. And I think for the bulk of it, it would be variable cost increases as we've got the equipment adding shifts, increasing line rates. So it's always fun to take volume up, and I think we're well prepared to do that, and it would mostly be variable. John Murphy : Super helpful. Thank you so much, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open. Chris McNally : Thanks so much, team. Great quarter. Paul, maybe just a question around the variance that maybe remains in the guide. So as been discussed, just high level, the pricing has gone from 2% assumption for the full-year to sort of 0.75%, given your second-half comment. If I just run that pricing variance of 50 basis points for the -- for just the second-half, about $400 million of variance? Maybe you can go through some of the other aspects that are sort of left to be determined because it seems like there's a lot in your control, so maybe China and any of the cost reductions just how we sort of fill that other $1.5 billion in the variance in the guide? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So thanks for that, Chris, and thanks for the kind words. What I would say is that if you look at from where we started the year, it's about probably $2 billion of trend line improvement from our initial guide. We've taken our guidance up now by $1 billion. The other $1 billion, I would say, is largely China underperformance. We started the year thinking that we were going to be similar to last year's profitability. Obviously, we've taken that down. And then the second area is really on EV volumes. So despite the fact that they come in at a lower contribution, we were projecting on the higher volumes a variable profit contribution in the third quarter that has now been kicked out a little bit on the lower volumes. That explains really the bulk of it. But I'm really pleased that we've been able to take our guidance up now in two consecutive quarters. And we're a full $1 billion at the midpoint ahead of where we were at the beginning of the year. Chris McNally : That's a great summary because that was my second question. Okay. So pricing from the beginning of the year, $2 billion better, $1 billion is now reflected in the guide. And the $1 billion offset is a combination of some China variance that's underperforming. Probably second half is a little bit left to be determined and also EV volumes. Is that a fair summary? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Chris McNally : Perfect. Thanks so much, team. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good morning. Congratulations on the strong results and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned watching EV inventory levels closely and using demand as a guide for how fast you ramp up EV production? To the extent GM does less than the 200,000 EV wholesales this year you're currently contemplating, could the company still be variable profit positive in the fourth quarter perhaps with incremental cost actions? Paul Jacobson : Mark, thanks for the kind words, and appreciate the question. I would say that when we started the year, we were looking at getting to variable profit low 200,000 range. We're obviously continuing to do the work that we need to do on the lower volumes, and we see that. I mean to the extent that we see volumes going lower, we obviously have to adjust to that, but we're really focused on the long-term here. And that is the trend trajectory of scaling up in the business. We're already seeing meaningful cost improvements as we ramp up the battery cell plants and really come off some of the imported cells and things that we were doing last year. So this is a journey for us, and it's one that we're absolutely focused on doing. So we don't want to end up in a situation where we're just producing to a target, and the demand isn't there. We've seen what happens when you do that, and you've got residual value implications, which stay with you for a long, long time. So that balance is what's most important to us and continuing along the journey. So we're focused right now on that 200 to 250 and believe that we can hit the variable profit positive in the fourth quarter. And we're going to continue to work towards that best we can. Mark Delaney : Understood, thanks. My other question was on GM Financial. It looks like you slightly raised the EBIT outlook for the year to $2.75 billion to $3 billion. I think as of the first quarter, you were thinking $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Maybe talk about what's driving the slight uptick in GM Financial. And more broadly on the financial market in auto finance, we've heard and read about some rising delinquencies for the industry more generally. Maybe speak about GM Financial and any change in delinquency rates. Thank you. Dan Berce : Yes. This is Dan Berce. So on the first part of your question with respect to the uptick in the lower end of the guide, we obviously had a strong first-half at GMF earning $1.6 billion, which puts us in a really good position to hit in that range of $2.75 billion to $3 billion. The couple of factors that would be headwinds in the second-half are that we're going to have less lease terminations in the second-half, along with expectations for mildly lower used car pricing. And then the second factor in the second-half is that our credit typically seasonally in the second half is weaker than the first-half, so our provisions will be higher. So that's really the reason for a slightly weaker second half. Now with respect to your question about credit trends, first of all, baseline, our portfolio at GMF is 75% plus prime. And we're seeing very, very steady performance for the prime customer. They still have excess savings. The -- obviously, the job market is strong. And so that piece of our portfolio has been really stable. Now the less than prime, like other lenders, we've seen a bit of deterioration mostly from vintages in 2022 and 2023. More recently, we've seen stabilization, albeit at slightly higher levels. But we've seen stabilization in that part of our portfolio. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open. Tom Narayan : Hi, yes. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on Level 2 plus subscription take rates. Tesla is seeing what many would describe as somewhat disappointing, I think, single-digit percentage take rates of its FSE product. BMW told us last week they're seeing 30% plus take rates on its five series in California, and its pricing is a lot lower than Tesla's. Just curious if you've given your take rates from Super Cruise or if you had any commentary on what you think drives demand there. There's a saying that safety is boring. Perhaps it was all about pricing. Just love to hear any thoughts there, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Mary Barra : Our Super Cruise ramp has been slow because of some of the chip availability that we have. We're now expected by year-end this year to have Super Cruise on 22 nameplates and in some cases, on up trims for instance, on the new Traverse standard. So I don't have the specific take rates because it's -- part of it is it comes with the vehicle, and some of it can be something they can subscribe to. So we can follow up with you after the fact on that. Paul Jacobson : Yes. And Tom, I'll just add. It's just -- it's a little bit too early because we're coming through that trial period in significant volumes. So we should have a lot more color, I would say, over the next 12 to 18 months as we start to see people lapse out of their three-year period and getting to that. But it's obviously something that we're watching in the commercial teams all over it. Tom Narayan : Great, thanks. And then as a quick follow-up, actually, to Joe's Cruise question, I understand the pivot here to Bolt. But I remember the decision to do Origin was largely an economic one. So just curious if you're still in tandem to the new approach, still going to continue maybe lobbying for this purpose-built vehicle to regulators? Thanks. Mary Barra : Yes. We definitely will be looking for, frankly, more than just what the vehicle is, but to have the right regulatory environment to release this technology that we believe definitely improved safety of miles traveled for everyone. So we're going to continue to work hard to continue to allow autonomous technology, both rideshare and from a PAB perspective to continue. And frankly -- switching to the Bolt at this time because of the regulatory environment actually improves Cruise's costs. So we think it's a win-win. But we're in the early, early phases of what rideshare is going to be and how we're going to leverage autonomous technology. I do think in the future, there's going to be opportunity for a vehicle like the Origin. And so that remains open to us at the right time. This was about getting cost down at Cruise and being able to scale without regulatory uncertainty. Tom Narayan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hi, good morning everyone. To follow-up on China, challenges are expected for the second-half. But just to put a finer point on this, is the expectation for JV losses to sustain in the third and fourth quarters? And then just high level, what are the pillars here to GM's China strategy going forward? What should turn this around as we consider next year and beyond? Mary Barra : Well, I think critical is we've got to get the -- our structural cost right to the new realities of this market. And so we are fully recognizing that we -- the ongoing challenges that we have. And so we're going to -- there's a three-pronged strategy we've got to execute the plan to align production to the current retail reality, get rid of the existing higher inventories and then aggressively reduce the structural cost. From an SGMW perspective, we actually maintained a stable market share as this operation is very important and also support some of the global emerging markets through exports from our General Motors perspective. And then as we've talked about in the past and Paul mentioned it, we have the premium channel, where we believe we have an opportunity to export with very low capital investment, very capital efficient, I should say, to take some of our most iconic products and export them into the market at the top end. So I think when we look at the strength of the Buick brand and the China brand, there's a path forward in this market that we do believe over the course of the midterm is going to resume to growth. So that is our plan, and I'm not going to predict where we're going to be exactly in the second quarter. I will just tell you, we're working aggressively to improve that situation and leverage what we have in GMW and also the opportunity that we'll have with the premium channel. James Picariello : Got it. That's helpful. And then just with respect to the second-half versus first-half, can you provide additional color on the $1 billion in additional costs that were referenced in the second-half. What's driving that outlay? And has this number changed versus your prior guidance? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes, James. So the biggest piece of it to be highlighted is about $400 million of marketing spend, which is seasonally weighted towards the second half of the year in conjunction with a number of the launches that we have. We knew that going into the year. The other big piece of it, I would say there are some commodities and EV cost retimes. So these are a little bit new, just as we've kind of pivoted on our assumptions going forward. The commodities, look, we're going to respond to that, and we always do. But those are the 3 biggest categories, I would say, on the second-half. And the team is working through it and feel good about our performance so far. James Picariello : Appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Thank you very much, and I hope everybody can see that from our results and our new higher guidance, we are making the most of every opportunity we have in ICE and in EV and leveraging our core strengths. We're being flexible and opportunistic, but also importantly, we're being very disciplined. A better Cruise is moving forward once again, and there's significant opportunity there. We're going to continue to return significant capital to our owners as we move forward and the opportunity presents itself. So if you look back, this was a great first-half. And we're going to build on it and continue to improve the business, and we have more opportunity to continue to do that to drive our future success. We're going to expand on all these topics at our Investor Day in Springhill, Tennessee. And so I hope you will attend. You're going to have a chance to drive our newest ICE and EV products and see close up our cell manufacturing expertise and our manufacturing flexibility. We think it's compelling, and we look forward to having that session with all of you. So thank you very much for joining, and I hope you have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining. You may disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, October 22, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the third quarter of 2024. Our conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO; and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Berce, President and CEO of GM Financial, will also be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thank you, Ashish, and good morning, everyone. I want to begin by recognizing the incredible job our team, our suppliers and our dealers have been doing all year long. We have been able to grow our retail market share in the U.S. with above-average pricing, well-managed inventories and below-average incentives. Now with our strong third quarter results, we expect our full-year EBIT adjusted to be in the range of $14 billion to $15 billion and EPS diluted adjusted to be in the range of $10 to $10.50, both at the upper end of our previous guidance. And we are once again raising our adjusted automotive free cash flow. I want to be clear, though, we are not mistaking progress for winning. The competition is fierce, and the regulatory environment will keep getting tougher. That's why we are focused on optimizing our ICE and EV margins. We have a very strong record in ICE, and we are on track to produce and wholesale about 200,000 EVs in North America this year and make our portfolio variable profit positive this quarter. This is a first step. We are working with urgency to make our EVs profitable on an EBIT basis as quickly as possible. To get there, we will continue to drive improvements across the business. Apart from our financial performance and the progress we've made growing our ICE business and scaling EVs, one of the things that truly stands out about the quarter is the resiliency and compassion of our suppliers and dealers after the storms that hit the Southeast. We are saddened by the destruction and loss of life and grateful for their significant contributions to relief efforts, which GM and our employees have supported through contributions to the Red Cross. One GM supplier that stands out is Auria Solutions in Old Fort, North Carolina, which makes carpets for our full-size SUVs. They worked tirelessly to support their employees and their community as well as GM. They even drilled a new well to restore water service to the plant and to their neighbors. This is a great example of the steps people in our business are willing to take to support their employees and manage events outside of their control. At Investor Day, we focused on the business drivers for 2024 and 2025 that are within our control. They include a wide range of new and redesigned ICE SUVs that are more profitable than the outgoing models; steadily improving EV profitability as we scale production and expand our portfolio; fixed cost discipline; capital efficiency and improved results in China. We are building momentum in all of these areas. For example, the new Chevrolet Traverse, GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave continue to grow their volumes in retail market share with very strong pricing, and the new ICE Chevrolet Equinox is arriving in dealerships in greater volume. We've seen month-over-month gains in retail segment share for the Equinox, ATPs are about $6,000 higher than the outgoing models, and we are attracting younger buyers. Without a doubt, these vehicles, along with our new full-size SUVs, are some of the best we've ever delivered from a design, safety and technology standpoint. And I can say definitively that one of our other new ICE models, the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, is the fastest car we've ever built. It's a 1,064-horsepower engineering marvel, and Mark Reuss recently drove it at 233 miles per hour on a High-Speed Oval in Papenburg, Germany, a speed that's unrivaled by any current production car priced under $1 million. That wasn't a one-off in performance either. Five engineers also exceeded 230 miles per hour on multiple runs. If you haven't seen the video Chevrolet posted to TikTok and YouTube, please check them out. Like the breathtaking performance of the Corvette, our strategic portfolio of EVs is separating GM from our competitors. As you know, we earned the number two EV sales position for the third quarter. Our total share is approaching 10% of the EV market, and our EV conquest rates are more than 60%. If you attended Investor Day, I hope you have a deeper appreciation for the role our battery manufacturing capabilities and overall cell strategy are playing in our drive to EV profitability. The scale and vertical integration we have achieved with LGES in Ohio and Tennessee is a major competitive advantage that's driving down cell costs, so are the world-class yield rates we are seeing. Because we jointly produce ourselves, we reap the benefits of lower commodity prices, and we are generating significant manufacturing credits at both the cell and module level. It will be years before some of our competitors approach this level of performance. To drive more EV sales growth, all of our brands have been conducting extensive dealer outreach and training. For example, Chevrolet has been meeting with more than 7,000 dealership sales employees to educate them about EV technology and charging and the competitive advantages we have in areas like affordability, range, capability and the total cost of ownership. People are leaving these meetings energized and just as confident in our EV portfolio as they are in our winning ICE products. The training should really pay off in 2025 as we continue to expand our truck portfolio with both lower-cost and longer-range versions of the Silverado EV. Our longest-range work trucks will have the ability to go nearly 500 miles on a full charge. Our most affordable work truck will begin at about $57,000, and both the LT with standard content and the LT premium package are priced so eligible customers may qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit. We will also have our full range of Equinox EV and Blazer EV models in the market starting in the first quarter, including a new more affordable Blazer as well as an expanded portfolio of GMC Sierra EVs. Our Cadillac portfolio is expected to be another driver of volume and share growth, conquest sales and EV profitability improvements as we go forward. EV consideration is much stronger among luxury customers than the mainstream market, about nine points higher, so we expect it to grow faster. These customers want beautiful designs, advanced technology, performance and range, everything Cadillac delivers with the LYRIQ, OPTIQ, VISTIQ and the Escalade IQ. No other luxury brand has so much to offer. Let's turn to China where the team is making progress aligning production to demand. In the third quarter, GM and our JVs grew sales 14% from second quarter for our best performance since the third quarter of 2022. Our growing portfolio of EVs and plug-in hybrids played a key role. In fact, our new energy vehicles outsold ICE models for the first time. Importantly, our dealer inventory has been reduced by more than 50% since the start of the year, which will allow us to better manage our pricing and costs. We will also continue to drive dealer engagement and discipline on fixed cost, inventory, pricing and incentives. However, the operating environment in China continues to be challenging, and there is more hard work to do with our partner. There are a series of shareholder and joint venture Board meetings planned during the fourth quarter that will be focused on restructuring actions to make the business sustainable and profitable, and we will share next steps as soon as we can. We will also provide an update on Cruise when we can share more details about their future funding model. In the meantime, the Cruise team continues to improve their technology and cost structure. Another area where you can expect news in the weeks and months ahead is in capital efficiency. As Kurt Kelty shared, we continue to refine our cell strategy with the incorporation of prismatic cells and new chemistries. We are seeing enterprise-wide benefits from winning with simplicity, and we'll continue to add EV capacity in a measured cadence by converting existing component and assembly plants. And we are making good progress with Hyundai on specific areas of cooperation. We are nearing the completion of our first definitive agreement, and we expect to have something to share soon. I'll close my prepared remarks by reiterating the commitment we made at Investor Day to build on our competitive strengths and deliver the performance that differentiates us from others in the industry. We know that's what investors expect and it's the best way for us to demonstrate both leadership and our true long-term growth potential. Thank you. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Paul to walk you through the quarter. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary, and I appreciate you all joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that our business continues to perform well, demonstrating ongoing discipline and a focus on delivering consistent financial results. And none of this would have been possible if it weren't for the hard work and dedication of our amazing team. A big thanks to everyone. It all begins with our stellar ICE portfolio, where we've been able to maintain strong pricing compared to the industry and our highly profitable full-size pickup and full-size SUVs continue to gain market share in their respective segments. We've been able to achieve these market share gains with significantly lower incentives than our competitors. For example, in the third quarter, our U.S. incentives were approximately 2.4 percentage points lower than the industry average, a gap that has widened from last year's third quarter where we were 1 percentage point below the industry. This demonstrates the strength of our products and our disciplined go-to-market strategy. I also want to highlight our ongoing commitment to financial discipline and that we are on track to meet our $2 billion net fixed cost program by the end of this year. On capital allocation, we repurchased $1 billion worth of stock in the quarter, retiring another 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with a diluted share count of 1.12 billion, down 19% compared to the end of the third quarter last year. We anticipate that the ASR will be completed by the end of October. Our current estimate is that we will retire approximately 25 million additional shares associated with the program in the fourth quarter, bringing the total number of shares retired as part of this program to nearly 250 million. All told, when you compare our third quarter results to last year, you can see that the company continues to execute well. Revenue was up 10% to $49 billion, with year-over-year volume growth in both ICE and EVs. This is driven by having a great product portfolio and offering customers attractive choices in key segments. The higher wholesale volumes are also supported by three consecutive years of retail market share growth along with conquest rates at 60% or above for our EV sales. We achieved $4.1 billion in EBIT adjusted, 8.4% EBIT-adjusted margins and $2.96 a share in EPS diluted adjusted, up roughly 30% year-over-year. Some of the performance during the quarter was timing, including a pull forward of some full-size SUV production to support the ramp of the refresh model during the fourth quarter and prioritizing full-size pickup availability. We estimate these factors had an EBIT impact of around $400 million for the third quarter that would have otherwise occurred in the fourth quarter. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $5.8 billion during the third quarter, up $900 million compared to last year due to EBIT improvements, lower capital expenditures and improved working capital driven by higher production volume at the end of Q3. North America delivered third quarter EBIT-adjusted margins of 9.7%, which resulted in $4 billion of EBIT adjusted, up $500 million year-over-year. This was driven by higher wholesale volumes, strong pricing, ongoing cost containment and the EV valuation allowance benefit. Pricing for the quarter was up $900 million year-over-year and better than what we assumed in our guidance. About half of this pricing benefit was from really strong performance from our mid-sized SUVs, especially the Chevrolet Traverse. The rest was primarily from pricing adjustments that we made on our full-size SUVs and the Corvette in the fourth quarter of last year, which have now been fully lapped. I also want to address another topic of interest, namely how we are addressing warranty costs. The continued inflationary pressures, combined with warranty claims on a few of our high-volume vehicles, led to a $700 million year-over-year adjustment in the third quarter from both reserve and rate adjustments. The primary issue causing the increased warranty accruals has been identified, and the fix was put into production earlier in the year. Despite this expense, as you can see, our financial results remained strong. We are committed to the highest standards of quality and customer satisfaction. Lastly, dealer inventory levels ended the quarter at 68 days for ICE vehicles, along with 10 to 12 EVs per dealer to help increase customer awareness. The seasonally strong fourth quarter sales period, launch timing and lower wholesale due to the holiday season as well as continuing discipline with our production levels puts us on track to end the year with total ICE inventory in our targeted range of 50 days to 60 days and an appropriate level of EVs. GM International third quarter EBIT-adjusted was $50 million, down $300 million year-over-year, driven by the continued challenges in the China market. As for our international business, excluding China equity income, we are seeing stability and consistent results compared to the prior year. Our cost actions and disciplined approach to pricing and volume are driving margin growth in South America and the Middle East, which is offsetting competitive and FX headwinds. GM Financial has consistently performed well with third quarter EBT-adjusted of $700 million, down $50 million year-over-year due to credit reserves within our expectations and still tracking in the range of $2.75 billion to $3 billion for the full-year. They continue to drive portfolio growth and paid a $450 million dividend to GM during the quarter. Cruise expenses were $400 million in the quarter, down $350 million from a year-ago, reflecting a reduction in operational activities. We are continually looking for opportunities to prioritize further expense reductions even as we continue to make progress. Let's move now to the rest of the year. Given the positive momentum we've seen thus far and our confidence in the rest of the year, we are narrowing full-year 2024 guidance too. EBIT-adjusted to the $14 billion to $15 billion range; EPS-diluted-adjusted to the $10 to $10.50 a share range, which are both at the high end of our prior guidance; and increasing our adjusted automotive free cash flow to the $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion range. Our cash flow remains strong, and the increased guidance is driven by the timing of certain accruals such as warranty. For EBIT-adjusted, our guidance assumes lower earnings in the fourth quarter, in part due to the $400 million I discussed earlier, along with lower expected ICE wholesale volume, which can be attributed to two factors. First, we experienced a few days of downtime at our facilities that produce full-size pickups and SUVs earlier this month due to supply chain disruption caused by the hurricanes. In addition, we are in the process of ramping our refreshed full-size SUVs, which will have an impact on production rates as these are our most profitable vehicles, any production changes have an outsized impact on profitability. Second, the fourth quarter is impacted by seasonality as it tends to have about eight fewer production days due to the holidays. We have also incorporated an impact from higher EV volumes and lower pricing in part due to higher seasonal industry incentives. In closing, I want to reiterate a few important points. The anticipated results for the fourth quarter should not be seen as a reflection of the company's full-year earnings potential. In fact, we are expecting full-year results for 2025 to be in a similar range to our robust performance in 2024. We are on track to produce and wholesale approximately 200,000 EVs this year and reach variable profit positive in Q4. Our EV momentum is growing. We continue to invest in the business and create products our customers love and are willing to pay for as this is fundamental to our success. While at the same time, we're finding efficiencies and opportunities to make the business more profitable. Finally, we expect to consistently return excess capital to our shareholders and are making progress towards our goal of reducing the number of outstanding shares to less than 1 billion in early 2025. And by the way, that is just the next mile marker, not the end goal. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Spak with UBS. Your line is open. Joseph Spak : Thank you, everyone. Good morning. I guess just to start, Paul. With the warranty, can you just go over that again? How much was that sort of the onetime reserve release and you also talked about a rate adjustment? By that, I'm assuming you mean an accrual rate? And is that \u2013 I guess, that continues at least into the first half of 2025. Is that how we should think about it? Paul Jacobson : Yes. Good morning, Joe. Thanks for the question. So you're right, it was both. What I would say is we have been pretty clear over the last several quarters that we've seen a lot of inflation, particularly in parts and labor for the warranty claims, while quality has been improved, down \u2013 events are down about 25% over the last couple of years. We are seeing that inflation. We've continued to see that. So we do a review in the third quarter on the warranty accruals, and this is what it was determined. There were also a couple, as I said in the prepared remarks, a couple of quality issues that we had uncovered in prior model years that we've already fixed in the production lines and don't see a problem going forward. So we think that there's some stability there. And hopefully, as we eclipse the largest part of the inflationary cycle, this can be a tailwind over the next few years on comparison. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then maybe just one housekeeping. I think last quarter, you talked about the inventory in line being about $600 million in the back half, maybe $300 million per quarter and it was $600 million this quarter. So is that also a timing thing? Or I know I think all of last year was about a $1.7 billion headwind. So it still seems like there's a little bit more room to run on that. I guess I just want to understand how you expect the remainder of that inventory in line to progress? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So I think this is some of the seasonality that we've talked about and what we alluded to in the difference. So we pulled forward some production here in the \u2013 from the fourth quarter into the third quarter in anticipation of some of the lost production days. So that is about $400 million that we see was kind of a pull forward. But we do expect that by the end of the year as is consistent with our targeted to be back in that 50 to 60-day range. So there's some impact here, and that's why we're seeing some of the discrepancy between third quarter and fourth quarter at the midpoint of our raised guidance. Joseph Spak : Sorry, to be clear, I was talking about the inventory unwind on the EV side? Paul Jacobson : I'm sorry. You're talking about the lower of cost or market adjustment? Joseph Spak : Yes, exactly. [Indiscernible] Paul Jacobson : Sorry, I thought that was an inventory question. So yes, so as you know, that adjustment is a function of both the inventory that we have on hand for finished cells as well as finished products, but also a function of our ongoing improvements in profitability. So we think that slows down a little bit as we get to year-end, but we're going to continue to watch that. But I think it can be a little bit of a tailwind next year, but probably not as much as we saw in 2024. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Sorry for missing that. I misunderstood the question, sorry. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on the 2025 outlook here. You guys are kind of indicating that there will be $2 billion to $4 billion improvement in the EV losses that will benefit EBIT, yet you're saying sort of the total EBIT will be about similar year-over-year, which implies a pretty big deterioration in the ICE business, which seems given the state of where volumes are, pricing, your product intros, it seems like a pretty big drop. It's probably not going to happen. So I think if you look this from an optimism standpoint, you would say there could be $2 billion to $4 billion of upside to your guide. I guess maybe a skeptic would say you're not going to get that benefit from EVs as hard as you may try, there might be $2 billion to $4 billion of downside. But it just seems like the skew or the bias would probably be to the upside as the ICE business holds in close to flat. So I'm just curious what you think in the \u2013 sort of the core business outside of EVs is actually going to deteriorate by that much? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So John, as we said at Investor Day where we gave some high-level headwinds and tailwinds with the most prominent really being the progress that we're making on EVs, we'll give official guidance on 2025 as we get into fourth quarter like we typically do. But there are a lot of things that go into that where you know we're going to see labor cost inflation next year. We're also going to go into the year as we consistently do with pricing assumptions, et cetera, but all of that's a little bit preliminary just because we're in the middle of our budget process as we are setting our targets for 2025. John Murphy : Okay. And then just maybe one follow-up on the comment on Cruise capitalization that you also made at Investor Day. It sounds like you're looking to raise some kind of capital there. But the reality is you have plenty of capital. So what is the motivation for raising capital there? Is it for a strategic partner or maybe getting very low-cost capital or lower cost capital than you may be able to raise in the rest of the business just to fund Cruise? I mean, what's really the motivation there? Mary Barra : Well, I think as we look going forward, we believe in autonomy in general, but I think we want to make sure we're investing in autonomy as efficiently as possible. And there's a number of conversations that we're having with partners that I think just allows us to manage that investment more wisely. So that's what we're looking to do. John Murphy : So probably a partner with low-cost capital is probably both, Mary, right, as a motivation? Mary Barra : Yes. I don't want to speculate on what partner, but I just want to say that we're looking at ways that we can be more efficient. One of the things people say about the auto industry is we don't \u2013 we do a lot of \u2013 all do a lot of different things and don't always leverage where we can partner with other OEMs or with other companies. And so we're really looking to leverage that, especially across the business, as we've mentioned with the MOU that we have with Hyundai, the continuing work that we do with Honda. And as we look at the investment going forward in Cruise and Autonomy, we think it's important to do that there as well. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to start first with a question on the pricing in the bridge, which was up $900 million. I think this is maybe a little bit of a surprise to some folks because some of the third-party data appeared negative. You're now tracking at over $1 billion of positive price, and that's in the face of all of this price normalization. So maybe you could just give a little more color on the pricing piece of the bridge, why it has been so resilient for you and really not \u2013 what we're seeing is a third-party gate is not showing up in your bridge. And I know you've talked about normalization actually, but maybe you can give us some flavor for perhaps how your pricing can hold in even if the industry is weaker, perhaps it relates to just where you are with the product refresh cycle? I know you talked about refresh ICE SUVs, just more color on price in the bridge and its resiliency? Paul Jacobson : Yes, sure, Dan. Certainly, this is an aspect of the business that we've been very proud of, and it starts with the product portfolio. So not only have we been on a pretty consistent refresh cycle with our vehicles, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're also still lapping price increases that we were able to take last year. So some of that, we think, probably stabilizes as we get into the fourth quarter as we lap those \u2013 fully lap those price increases from last year, but it's something that we've tried to hold on to. I think our incentive behavior in the market has been very disciplined from the perspective of doing what is important for our products and our customers. And in fact, that gap to the industry average has been widening even beyond the 100 basis points that we've talked about historically, nearly doubling that in the September quarter. And I think a lot of that has to do with our disciplined approach to inventory as well. So we're going to continue to do that. But like I said, really proud of the products and what's out there, and we're seeing that in the demand for our vehicles. Dan Levy : And can you just remind us, as far as the SUV refreshes next year that comes typically with the price increase? Or\u2026 Paul Jacobson : Yes. Yes, it should. As we come out with the new full-size SUV refreshes, hopefully later this year, early next year. So more to come on that, and we think that momentum is going to continue with these great products. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. Second question is on cash and the free cash flow, just two-part question. One is on the free cash, maybe you can explain the midpoint of the free cash guide was raised by $3 billion even though EBIT was raised by funds, maybe color on that. And then also, your cash now is $27 billion on the balance sheet. You've talked about a $20 billion target. Maybe you can just give us a sense of how you're thinking about the cash position on the balance sheet. If $20 billion is the target or is that more of a minimum level that we should think of? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So Dan, on the free cash flow, what \u2013 when you look at the earnings trajectory this year, and now we're just a touch over 75% done with the year, what we've seen is generally go-to-market pricing has outperformed our initial expectations, while the costs that have come in have really been cash deferred costs. So when you look at warranty expense, for example, that's not a cash cost in the current year, but rather an accrual against expectations of future cash outlays. So because of that, the performance that we've seen and what we've been able to raise our guide has actually had a disproportionately strong effect on cash flow for that. So that really explains that. You're right, we were over $26 billion at quarter end. We continue to work through our capital allocation process, as we've talked about, our CapEx and our balance sheet are both in strong comfortable places. We have been somewhat limited, as we've talked about, in terms of share repurchases just because of the banks working through the tail end of the accelerated share buyback last year. We expect that to be done this month, and we can continue down the path of applying our capital allocation program. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I realized just a couple of weeks out on the Investor Day, where you were only preliminarily looking ahead to next year ahead of the formal guidance introduction next quarter. But I'd be curious if there were anything you could share with regard to your assumption for GM or industry pricing in 2025? I guess it's been a very hard number to forecast, given the track record of the past few years, I\u2019d be surprised if any of us guessed it correctly, I'm really looking for accuracy as much as the context with which to judge your outlook for continued very strong profit in 2025? Paul Jacobson : Well, thanks, Ryan. As we said when John asked earlier to and at Investor Day, we're not giving any specifics on 2025 as we go into it. But we'll have more information as we continue to close out 2024 and look at the new refreshes that are coming out, but we'll provide more detail on our fourth quarter call. Ryan Brinkman : And then just the thinking around that, is it that you're going to make your numbers regardless to find a way, like the $2 billion to $4 billion easy profit improvement, there's a lot of swing there, maybe some swing with China, if pricing does track softer, where would you look to offset that so that you can drive for those numbers? Paul Jacobson : Well, I think what the team hopefully has demonstrated over the last few years is an ability to be resilient and respond to where the market is. We've done that with cutting fixed costs. We've done that with on the revenue side of the equation as well. So we're going to look all over. But what you've got is a management team that is committed to driving results and driving performance and really demonstrating discipline and resiliency in changing conditions. I don't expect that 2025 is going to be any less changed than what we've seen over the last few years. But I think that that's something that we're going to be able to manage through. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. My first question is another one on free cash flow. It's obviously an incredibly impressive performance and outlook raise for this year. In the context of you saying, hey, next year, with our results could be in the same ballpark, do you feel that this applies to free cash flow as well? Or to the extent that there was some benefit this year from maybe working capital, building up, rebuilding inventory stock, et cetera, that free cash flow may be somewhat different next year? Paul Jacobson : Well, thanks, Emmanuel. I mean, clearly, there were a couple of things that were working in our favor this year. As I mentioned, the warranty accruals, which is really cash deferred as well as some inventory build from where we were in 20, we might not laugh. And I think it's more important, honestly, to be disciplined with our inventory than it is to use it as a tool to drive free cash flow. That's just short-term thinking if you're doing that. So I think it's too soon to tell, but we're committed to driving free cash flow performance in the business every bit as much as we are in margins. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. That's great to hear. And then I guess as a follow-up, I think you reiterated your commitment to try and reduce share count to 1 billion shares in early 2025. You would probably need to reduce your share count by like 120 million shares over the next three months or so. Is that like a $5 billion buyback? Is that the sort of acceleration that you're targeting just over the next few months essentially? Obviously, would be significantly faster than what we've seen recently. Just generally speaking, is this the right math? And then how should we think about future pace of buybacks? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So I will agree with your math that it's about 120 million shares to get there. And we've said that we believe that we can get there in early 2025. So no specific comments on when that is or what the velocity might be. But I think over the past year or so, I think we've demonstrated our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Emmanuel Rosner : Certainly. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Jonas : Hi. Thanks and good morning everyone. I had a question on the GM Financial side for Dan Berce. We noticed that the net charge-offs increased slightly to 1.2%, but they're still pretty low, looks very manageable. You mentioned a moderation in credit performance. But just wanted to see if you wanted to flag any other color or potential concerns. And as a follow-up, at GM Financial penetration is around 39%. Is that the right level to assume going forward? Or could we see this rise if the market got more competitive in 2025? Just wanting to see, again, not for short-term movements, but is this kind of dry powder for you to provide a better deal for your dealers and your customers in a more competitive environment going forward? Thanks. Daniel Berce : Yes. Thanks for the question. So with respect to credit, our charge-offs year-to-date at GM Financial are almost spot on what we expect going into the year. So things are really going as planned. We did expect a modest moderation in credit year-over-year, and that's exactly what we're seeing. Our portfolio is heavily prime, and the prime credits have continued to perform very, very strong with good employment levels, good household income and still pretty \u2013 or it's still pretty strong household balance sheet. So all-in-all, credit is developing very much in line with what we expected. And on the second part of your question with respect to penetration levels, we work with the OEM in terms of targeting penetration, a lot of the penetration results from either leasing or supported or subvented loans. Our long-term target is 40% to 45%. So yes, we were slightly below that, but the month of October, for instance, we're right in that range. So that is the strategy there, Adam. Adam Jonas : Thanks very much. And just lastly, on the CapEx, you're targeting stable CapEx, stable on this kind of $11 billion type range. Mary or Paul, I'm wondering how the mix of that CapEx has been changing. If you did like a look back last 12 months between EV, AV, ICE, new products, new capacities, how that might be shifting with the 12 months forward, at least a rate of change or proportion, particularly specifically with respect to some of the AI-related infrastructure that might be coming in? Is that a material number to call out yet? When could it be? And kind of how that mix of CapEx might be changing? Just any color around that without specificity would be very helpful? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks, Adam. I'll try that. I think if you look over the last few years, our CapEx has probably pivoted more towards product portfolio and away from infrastructure. As you know, we went through a big wave a few years ago of plant retooling and getting set up for the foundation to grow EVs. And we're really glad we made that investment because it's putting us in a position to be able to realize the scale benefits as we highlighted at Investor Day down at Spring Hill. So we're still maintaining a balance between EV and ICE as well. Still about 1/3 of our program capital is going into ICE vehicles, and you see that in the performance of the refreshes that we've put out, whether it's the midsized trucks or the small or midsized SUVs and then, ultimately, the full-size SUVs that are coming. Again, so I think we struck the right balance going forward. We do have a lot of a growing amount of capital for what I would call broad efficiency gains that are going to help lower our cost of production, but also deploy technology in everything that we do from building vehicles to the administrative side of the business as well. So that is playing a part. And we think that the $11 billion area of capital spending against what we're earning is very manageable and represents a disciplined approach. Mary Barra : Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Adam, is when we stay at that level approach, it definitely leads to, I think, higher-quality execution because we're not driving product engineering up and down or across manufacturing. So that definitely has been helpful. And then as we look at the mix between ICE and EV, there's been cases where we wait until what's the last moment where we have to make a decision on are we going to do a next generation of an ICE version? Are we \u2013 or what are we \u2013 how are we going to look at it from an EV perspective? And so we're really being led by the customer, and we have that flexibility now that we have that infrastructure that Paul talked about. So we're really trying to respond to the market and be very efficient with our capital. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Thanks Paul. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open. Tom Narayan : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. Paul, so price mix was a plus $300 million in Q3, North America on the EBIT bridge. Price specifically, $900 million, as you guys talked about, mix was a negative $600 million. EV sales coming at a lower mix that increases in Q4 to get to the 200,000 target. And I think you called out some price headwinds in Q4 versus Q3. So should we expect price mix net in North America to be a net negative in Q4? Is that \u2013 am I kind of understanding that right? Paul Jacobson : Yes, I think \u2013 Tom, thanks for the question. I think as you look at some of that lapping, it certainly could be. It's not going to be a benefit like we saw in the third quarter, and that's some of the walk between Q3 and Q4. But I think a lot of that is timing of things that we did a year-ago and so on and which is why we haven't said that and don't believe that fourth quarter is really an indicator of the run rate going forward in 2025. So that was augmented a little bit by some of the timing of wholesale in the quarter that we talked about with the pull forward, but I think you're directionally correct. Tom Narayan : Okay. And then Mary, on China, the color we're hearing from the German OEM, China is pretty put bluntly, is quite concerning even premium brands losing share to domestic. I know things can improve with a higher BEV mix and restructuring, but you're so strong arguably in the best market in the world right now in the U.S. I guess how committed are you to China longer term, especially if these losses persist? Thanks. Mary Barra : Well, we believe that we can turn around the losses, and that's why we have a series of meetings with our partner to make the hard decisions to get the business to be sustainable and profitable. Right now in the business, one of the things that's driving the improvement is the fact that the GLA, which is really our kind of we'd like to think of it as our full-size truck franchise in China, as we launch that new vehicle, it's doing very, very well. We did just cross over that now for more weighted to new energy vehicles than ICE. I think that's an important transformation that frankly, I would have liked to seen happen a little bit earlier. And then when you look at what we have from the premium import channel, that's a very capital-light way to participate in the market with unique products like the Chevrolet Tahoe that we're just starting to take orders for. And again, that gives us more scale. So we're going to be very measured as we go through. But when you look at the size of the China market and the growth opportunity that's in the mid to long-term, we think we can participate clearly in a different way than we did just a handful of years ago with the rise of hundreds of competitors from China domestic companies that frankly don't seem to prioritize profitability, they're definitely prioritizing production. It provides for a very challenging environment, and that's where I think we have to play in areas that are our strength and where we have franchises like the GLA and then some of the other premium products. But we do believe there's a place we can participate in a very different manner, but do that profitably, and that's what we're 100% focused on getting to as quickly as possible. Tom Narayan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Edison Yu : Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions. First, just on Cruise. We noticed that you indicated that the autonomous miles have gone up about 3x. Just curious, have you given any sort of rough framework on when you might return to actually unsupervised testing like you were before? Mary Barra : Yes. We hope to \u2013 well, one, we'll be gated by safety, but we hope and we're working hard to get there by the end of the year meeting the higher standard of role model driver as opposed to, I'll say, average human driver. So that is the goal that the team is working hard to every single day. Edison Yu : Got it. And just a follow-up on China, just in terms of the mechanics, given the losses, do we anticipate at some point having to actually fund the JV in a more material way? Or is the idea that, I guess, the restructuring under discussion would improve that, so we wouldn't have to do that? Mary Barra : I think we're looking to create a sustainable business within country. We have a \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have a series of meetings with the partner, so I don't want to get ahead of that of how that\u2019s going to \u2013 how we're going to go forward. I want to make sure we do that with our partner. So more to follow as we make those decisions. Edison Yu : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. James Picariello : Hi, everybody. I know a sequential bridge is not the easiest exercise. But at the midpoint of the full-year guide, right, we're looking at a $1.5 billion step-down in adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter. Just at a high level, can you help bucket the major factors that inform that quarterly decline, right, we'll see less ICE volume, more EVs? How could we think about pricing in that quarterly bridge? And to what extent are you seeing intensified competitor actions to address their prolonged dealer inventory problem in the U.S.? Is this dynamic in any way influencing GM's assumptions for the fourth quarter? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yes. Thanks, James. You're right, I don't want to get into all the details here. But directionally, as we talked about, there's about $400 million of timing that we talked about. There are about eight fewer production days in the fourth quarter than there are the third due to holidays, around Thanksgiving, around Christmas as well as Election Day, Veterans Day, things like that. So when you combine that with the cutover for the model year on the full-size SUVs, it starts to add up a little bit, so as well as lapping last year. And that's kind of where we are, but we think some of that is isolated to the fourth quarter, obviously, as we have given broad kind of perspective on 2025 going forward. So on the pricing side, I think the team has done a really good job of making sure that we're pricing our products to value for the customer, and we've done that somewhat independent. We've been through periods where one competitor or another is significantly taking up incentive levels. We've stayed pretty consistent in that. And as we've said, widen the gap against the industry. So we're going to do what's best for our customers and our products going forward, and that's been a strategy that continue to work for us. James Picariello : Got it. Just my follow-on would be just on the intensified competitor actions. Are you seeing anything there? And then my housekeep question for the share count, can you just confirm what the final ASR, right, that's getting completed, officially completed this month, what that ASR impact is on the share count? Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Sure. So just as I said, we see a lot of behavior from customers we've seen \u2013 or from our competitors. We have seen that it manifest itself in terms of higher incentive levels. We've managed through that. This isn't the first time that that's happened over our recent performance, and we're going to continue to manage our product portfolio to our demand. And I think that's a strategy that's worked well for us. In the prepared remarks, we talked about 250 million shares. Remember, we got most of the credit in our diluted share count last year when we closed the deal. But this is about another 25 million shares that will be delivered when it's done, and that will be new shares that reduce the denominator on EPS. James Picariello : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Daniel Roeska with Bernstein Research. Your line is open. Daniel Roeska : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I'll ask the companion question to Adam's CapEx question. Paul, could you shed some light on your thinking about the R&D budget and whether kind of the $10 billion run rate from last year is the right level going forward? And maybe has any of that shifted in terms of allocation between EV and ICE in product launches, given that the EVs are launched now and maybe also the broader slowdown of EVs in the market? Paul Jacobson : Yes. So I think when you look at the total sort of product development budget, combined with what we're doing with autonomy and so on. I think we've struck the right balance in terms of our ability to fund and, as Mary mentioned, our ability to drive returns out of our investment. So while we have successfully launched a number of our electric vehicle products. There's still work that can be done in terms of engineering more efficient solutions and the work that Mark talked about at Investor Day around winning with simplicity and removing part numbers and going in and trying to take out complexity from the business is a pretty strong engineering effort that goes into our product development budget. So we're focused on creating a portfolio that's going to win and win for the long-term, and that requires us to constantly be looking at that portfolio, both on the EV and the ICE side. So if we find ourselves in a situation where we're not generating as much cash flow, I think there's a lot of things in there that we can take a look at and we can adjust. But where we've been performing fairly consistently. We think that the total budget for product development and CapEx is very affordable and something that we can implement effectively. Daniel Roeska : Yes. Thanks. And maybe following up for Mary on that, you recently affirmed your 2035 ICE phase-out target. Kind of between now and then, and I get this is a little bit more strategic, but is there the need for a fully new BEV platform kind of before the end of the decade? Or are you confident that with what Paul just said, you can kind of keep on improving on the BEV3 and BT1 to kind of keep up with competition? Mary Barra : Yes, we definitely believe when you look at the core of the dedicated EV platform, there's clearly things that we're doing to drive more efficiency, and that work is going to continue \u2013 will continue different production \u2013 different design and production things that are going to help us take cost out of the business, but it's not a complete melt and repour by any stretch of the imagination. I would think it's more evolutionary. So that's how you should think about it. Daniel Roeska : Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open. Chris McNally : Thanks so much, team. Paul, I'm not trying to beat the dead horse after Murphy and Brinkman's question, but I know it's an important one for investors. Would you be able to even just for 2025, maybe prioritize or bucket the two main tailwinds, one being cost wage and the other one being priced just, which is sort of a larger headwind for 2025, so we can start to sort of make our own assumptions? Paul Jacobson : Well, thanks for that, Chris, and I think that is beating the dead horse. But as we talked about, there's a number of costs that we continue to look at in the business. What we're committed to is making sure that we keep our fixed cost discipline around that. We've talked about rather than flat, keeping it flat, excluding depreciation. So we'll see some depreciation headwinds next year that we expect going into. And we'll go into the year on the pricing assumptions that have served us well, which is to make sure that we set up a budget that is affordable for us and one that if the commercial environment stays consistent, one that we think we could outperform. But it would be irresponsible for us to think about and set a budget that as pricing continuing to grow and continuing to expand off of these levels and then have to adjust the business backwards. So we think that this is a strategy that's worked well for us, and we'll get into specifics when we give our fourth quarter results and our 2025 guidance. Chris McNally : Absolutely. Much appreciated. And then the follow-on question is around the sort of walk of $2 billion to $4 billion in lower EV losses next year. And this is a question I've been sort of surprised that I've been getting from investors, so going to pass it along, which is if EV sales were flat or down year-over-year in 2025, could you still achieve that $2 billion to $4 billion in lower EV losses? It's sort of my way of asking the election question without asking the election question? Paul Jacobson : Well, I'm not sure that's an election question as much as it is what our consumer is looking to do. But we've seen the recent uptick in September month, both in terms of demand, but also us getting share gains. And so I think that there is an element of growth next year for us in EVs as we continue to bring our products to market because the customers are responding to those. So when you look at what we were able to do to give our customers access to the Tesla Supercharger network, we're out there proactively addressing things like range anxiety with vehicles that have over 300 miles of range as well as supplementing that charging infrastructure with a really efficient solution for them. So we think that there's an opportunity to continue to expand that. Clearly, as we've articulated for the last year or so, scale is an important piece of it. But what's more important is making sure that we scale to demand, and we're there with a flexible portfolio for consumers and meeting them where they are. So obviously, if we don't grow as much, those scale benefits aren't going to be as fully realized, but our best estimate today, based on the momentum we see and where we see EV adoption going next year, is that we can realize meaningful savings in our EV profitability. Chris McNally : And so Paul, to summarize, the volume is a component of that, but it's not the only component. I mean, obviously, you're only just hitting positive contribution margins now. So I imagine there's also some of the annualization effect and you've also talked about Z sales and things like that. And so volume is one component of that $2 billion to $4 billion, but there's obviously a lot more on the year-over-year compare. Paul Jacobson : For sure. We're constantly making improvements in terms of the efficiency of production as well as the part number reductions that Mark has talked about as well as we should see some mix benefits coming in with the Cadillac Escalade IQ and some of the other vehicles that are coming to market. So there's a lot going on, a lot of moving parts, but that's just our best look where we are today on our journey. But again, the most important thing that we can do as a company is to get to that positive contribution margin. And I think we've got a good road map. And I think we've proven our resiliency in that even though we're at the lower end of what we projected our production to be at the beginning of the year. So continuing with that kind of scrappiness is, I think, what sets this team apart. Chris McNally : Really appreciate the detail, Paul. Paul Jacobson : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. With GM now selling the entry-level version of the Equinox EV that's priced starting at $35,000 prior to any IRA credits. I'm hoping to better understand if there are strong sales of that particular SKU, can GM still hit its EV profit improvement outlook for 4Q and 2025? Mary Barra : We're going to look across the entire EV portfolio that we're selling. And we talk about some of the different models are really going to be from a Blazer EV and Equinox EV are going to be coming in, in 2025. But we are going to look and make sure we're responding to what the customer likes. We're seeing strong interest in the Equinox with EV with what we have in the market right now. So I think it's doing well. As we go forward and we look to continue to grow, as Paul talked about, that's where additional options, I think, are going to be important. Mark Delaney : Thanks for that, Mary. Another question was just on your manufacturing flexibility. And to the extent there's a material increase in tariffs on vehicles imported into the U.S., can you talk about how much flexibility GM has to shift more of its production domestically and/or potentially offset tariffs with either pricing or cost reductions? Thanks. Mary Barra : I think we're always working on cost reductions. I think it depends on specifically what the tariffs would be. I would tell you, we are paying careful attention to the approach both candidates might take. And I'm not going to speculate on what either might do, but what I will tell you, we have and we'll continue to engage constructively with the policymaking process regardless of the election outcome. When you look at the number of jobs created in the U.S., even with some vehicles that are manufactured outside, a lot of them are in our partners from an ally perspective. So I think it's a very complex situation. When USMCA was formed, there was a lot of input being provided. And I think looking at jobs, looking at the jobs that have been created, especially when we look at battery plants and some of the other facilities that we've leveraged for drive motors or drive units, et cetera, that's going to all be factored in. So we're going to work constructively. And so it's too hard to speculate, not knowing exactly what's going to happen. But to just reiterate what Paul has said, we're going to be disciplined and we'll be resilient and we'll make adjustments to the extent that we can to continue to drive growth and profitability. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Again, I want to thank everybody for your questions. Appreciate your participation. I hope you look and you see our performance this year demonstrates that our focus is on building great vehicles because great vehicles matter, vehicles that have beautiful designs, the right technologies, the right range of their EVs that customer want to buy \u2013 really want to buy. We're going to continue to improve our ICE and EV profitability. We're going to maintain cost discipline, and we're going to continue to drive and look for ways to improve our capital efficiency. So in the weeks and months ahead, you'll see more clearly than ever how we intend to leverage the tailwinds that are within our control to deliver strong results in 2025 that are in a similar range to 2024. As we've said, we'll share more information about Cruise, China and our other new collaborations as soon as we can. And as Paul said, we'll wrap all of this into formal 2025 guidance that we'll share in January. So until then, please stay safe, and I'm sure we'll talk to you soon. Operator : That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to the General Motors Company Fourth Quarter and Calendar Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. During the opening remarks, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the opening remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded Tuesday, January 28, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ashish Kohli, GM's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ashish Kohli : Thanks, Amanda, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us as we review GM's financial results for the fourth quarter and calendar year 2024. Conference call materials were issued this morning and are available on GM's Investor Relations website. We are also broadcasting this call via webcast. Joining us today are Mary Barra, GM's Chair and CEO, and Paul Jacobson, GM's Executive Vice President and CFO. Dan Burse, President and CEO of GM Financial will also be joining us for the Q&A portion. On today's call, management will make forward-looking statements about our expectations. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review the safe harbor statement on the first page of our presentation as the content of our call will be governed by this language. And with that, I'm delighted to turn the call over to Mary. Mary Barra : Thanks, Ashish, and good morning. I'd like to begin by thanking our employees, dealers and suppliers for helping us deliver another outstanding year. A year ago on this call, I said that we were optimistic about 2024 given the choice we would offer customers, including industry-leading full-size pickups, new and redesigned SUVs and an expanding portfolio of EVs. And I stressed that we will be focused on execution and profitability. I'm proud to say that our full year revenue grew by 9% last year. We were #1 in the U.S. in retail, fleet and total sales. We grew our market share, and we distanced ourselves from the industry's pricing incentives and inventory pressures. In our growing EV business, we produced and wholesaled 189,000 vehicles in North America. We doubled our market share over the course of the year as we scaled production, and our portfolio became variable profit positive in the fourth quarter. This combination of compelling vehicles and high volume in growing segments, strong execution and discipline led to record EBIT-adjusted, record adjusted automotive free cash flow and record EPS-diluted-adjusted. At the same time, we continue to allocate capital consistently and in a balanced manner. We invested to drive the business forward and we improved our balance sheet. Our employees and owners are all sharing in our success. I'm pleased to share that our global salaried team earned strong performance bonuses and our U.S. hourly employees once again earned the industry's highest profit sharing, totaling more than $640 million. That's a record payout of up to $14,500 per person equal to more than two months of extra pay for average UAW-represented team member. Investors in GM also earned a 50% total return and we ended the year with fewer than 1 billion shares outstanding, a goal we reached ahead of plan. Throughout the year, we also addressed challenges with resolve. In China, we have been working with our JV partners to drive better performance in the market by right-sizing the businesses, launching new products, reducing dealer inventory and building to demand. We are making good progress and reported positive equity income for the fourth quarter before restructuring costs. To improve year-over-year results and make SGM sustainably profitable, they will be implementing a wide range of restructuring initiatives this year that include reducing capacity to operate within utilization levels of about 80% or better. We are in the process of finalizing details with our partner. Importantly, we believe SGM has the resources to complete its restructuring without additional capital from GM. As you know, we also stopped funding robotaxi development at Cruise. We have a proposed restructuring plan that will refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles. We expect to see a run rate savings of about $1 billion on an annualized basis by ending robotaxi development, and we look forward to acquiring the small number of Cruise shares we don't own and finalizing the restructuring plan later this quarter. The momentum we have in both ICE vehicles and EVs will drive our results once again in 2025. For example, the redesigned Chevrolet and GMC full-size SUVs that we launched late last year are supporting even stronger ATPs than the outgoing models, thanks to their refined exteriors, all new interiors and new models like our GMC Yukon AT4 Ultimate. We also have a full year of our new compact and midsize ICE SUVs, which include some of our highest volume nameplates like the Chevrolet Equinox, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia. They are great examples of our strategy to pair bold designs to drive higher ATPs with discipline and capital efficiency to drive better profitability. As Mark shared at Investor Day, we're seeing EBIT improvements in the 10 percentage point range on some of these vehicles. Cadillac is also very well positioned. Last year, Cadillac had its best full year sales since 2016, thanks to the ongoing success of the Escalade with its refined exterior and stunning new interior, our high-performance V-Series and Blackwing models and the LYRIQ, which is now the country's best-selling midsized luxury electric SUV, according to S&P Global Mobility. This year, we expect the Escalade IQ, OPTIQ and VISTIQ to further grow GM share of the luxury EV market. EV adoption has been higher in luxury segments. We are being guided by the customer and will continue to be. And these new Cadillac stand out with their beautiful designs, advanced technology and customer-focused innovation. Here are just a few examples. The OPTIQ, which is scaling now, and the seven-passenger VISTIQ, which launches in the spring, will be the first Cadillacs to offer AKG audio systems with Dolby Atmos that reveal more depth, detail and clarity in the customer's favorite music. All Cadillac EVs now come equipped with vehicle-to-home capability, allowing them to power a home during outages using a GM Energy PowerShift Charger and our vehicle-to-home equipment package. And with the VISTIQ, Cadillac will be the first GM brand to roll out a new ADAS feature that builds on adaptive cruise control and lane centering. The new feature allows an attentive driver to engage the system and travel on millions of miles of roads with a light hand on the wheel. Then, there's the Cadillac Escalade IQ. With its presence, range, performance, comfort and technology, it's really in a class of its own. One of our New York area Cadillac dealers who has decades of experience with other luxury franchises says it's the most impressive vehicle he has ever driven. Customers are noticing. Since production began late last year, we've sold more than 1,500 Escalade IQs. 2025 will also be a year of rapid growth for Super Cruise across all of our brands. Our customer-focused strategy with Super Cruise is to continuously refine and expand its capabilities to make it indispensable. This is how we are setting the stage for recurring high-margin revenue streams from subscriptions. Since we launched Super Cruise, we have added hundreds of thousands of miles of new roads to its network and introduced features like automatic lane change and hands-free towing. This has helped make about 60% of our roughly 360,000 Super Cruise customers regular users. This year, we expect our Super Cruise equipped fleet to roughly double in size. Subscription revenue is becoming an increasingly important part of the Super Cruise opportunity, now that our first customers have completed their three-year trial. Last year, we saw subscription attach rates of about 20% off of a base of roughly 18,000 vehicles. This year, an additional 33,000 vehicles will end their trial period and we target to more than double subscription revenue. Within five years, we expect to approach about $2 billion in total annual revenue from Super Cruise. These are just a few of the many exciting opportunities ahead of us and we look forward to sharing more details with you as we go forward. Before I turn the call over to Paul, I'd like to mention the projects we're pursuing with Hyundai. As Hyundai has shared, our teams are moving quickly to finalize the first of several product and purchasing agreements that are designed to help us move faster, lower cost and become more capital efficient. The collaborations will be global in nature, targeting specific segments and areas of the business, and we'll be sharing more details very soon. I would also like to address the uncertainty around public policy, trade and regulation. It remains to be seen how things will evolve. So, our 2025 guidance, Paul will share in his remarks, does not take into account future policy changes. We have been both proactive with Congress and the administration, and in our conversations, we have stressed the importance of a strong manufacturing sector and American leadership in advanced technologies. It's clear that we share a lot of common ground and we have appreciated the dialogue. We believe the President wants to use policy and regulations in ways that will strengthen, not harm domestic manufacturers like GM. We look forward to continuing to work with the President and his team as they consider how to strike the right balance on these important issues. With respect to possible tariffs, we are working across our supply chain, logistics network and assembly plants so that we are prepared to mitigate near-term impacts. Many of these actions are no cost or low cost. What we won't do is spend large amount of capital without clarity. Whatever happens on these fronts, we have a very broad and deep portfolio of ICE vehicles and EVs that are both growing market share, and we'll be agile and execute as efficiently as possible. With that, I'd like to invite Paul to walk you through our results and 2025 financial guidance, and then we'll move to Q&A. Thank you. Paul Jacobson : Thank you, Mary. And I appreciate you all joining us this morning as we summarize another year of strong financial results for GM. Our full year EBIT-adjusted of $14.9 billion was at the high end of the range we guided to in October, driven by a particularly strong November and December. This resulted in $10.60 of EPS-diluted-adjusted, up 38% year-over-year and partially aided by a significantly lower share count as we continued to return excess capital to shareholders. We increased our full year revenue by 9% to $187 billion, with a 6% rise in wholesale volumes and ATPs above $50,000 Throughout the year, our incentives as a percentage of ATP steadily improved, starting the first quarter nearly 1 percentage point below the industry average and ending the year at the lowest incentive levels in the industry and more than 3 points below average. Our strategy of disciplined pricing and incentives continues to separate us from most of our peers. And at the same time, we are growing market share. Our U.S. market share for the full year was up 30 basis points to 16.5%, and we ended the year on a positive note at 17.5% in the fourth quarter, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2018, excluding the impacts of the pandemic in 2020. Our performance was fueled by strong EV growth and a refreshed ICE portfolio. ICE dealer inventory ended at 53 days at the low end of our 50 to 60 day year-end target, driven by strong sales and appropriately balancing our production to demand. And we are also making significant progress on EVs. In 2024, we wholesaled 189,000 EVs and delivered more than 146,000 units. Recall at the end of the third quarter, we had around 100 days of EV dealer inventory so that customers would have the opportunity to see and experience our products. This strategy paid off, and we successfully reduced this to 70 days by year-end as our EV deliveries rose. As Mary highlighted, a big focus of the company has been improving EV profitability. We achieved variable profit positive on our EVs in the fourth quarter through continued manufacturing scale and efficiencies from higher production, improved material cost, including lower cell cost from scale and performance, and expansion of our EV portfolio with the launch of the Cadillac Escalade IQ and Sierra EV. There's more work to achieve our goal of a positive EBIT margin, but we believe we're making good progress. For instance, the Equinox EV has seen $1,000 improvement in variable profit since its launch in just the second quarter of last year. Next, I'd like to discuss capital allocation. We continue to balance three key elements : investing in our business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning excess capital to our shareholders. First, we believe that the amount of capital we are investing back into the business is appropriate to efficiently support long-term profitable growth. Our forecasted capital spend in 2025, including battery JV investments, remained similar year-over-year at $10 billion to $11 billion. Second, we paid off $750 million of senior notes in the fourth ahead of their maturity in 2025. We have another $1.75 billion maturing later this year. We will assess refinancing opportunities or debt extinguishment as we progress throughout the year. Third, we returned a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders during 2024. We generated full year adjusted auto free cash flow of $14 billion and returned nearly 55% of this free cash flow or approximately $7.6 billion. In the fourth quarter, we completed the ASR, retiring an additional 25 million shares. We also repurchased 87 million shares in the open market during the quarter at an average price of $53.84 a share. This resulted in us ending the year with an outstanding share count of 995 million, achieving our goal from early last year to reduce our share count below 1 billion shares earlier than scheduled. On a diluted basis, this represents 1.02 billion shares, a decrease of 28% since the end of 2022 and a decrease of 12% compared to the end of 2023. Moving forward, we expect to continue returning excess capital to our shareholders and further reducing the share count. Getting into the fourth quarter results, total company revenue was $48 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by higher wholesales and consistent pricing. We achieved $2.5 billion in EBIT-adjusted, 5.3% EBIT-adjusted margins and $1.92 in an EPS-diluted-adjusted. We completed the net $2 billion fixed cost reduction program. Compared to the end of 2022, we realized $900 million in lower marketing spend and $700 million in lower automotive engineering costs. The remainder was realized through rationalization across some of our earlier stage initiatives, which was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization. A quick update on our EV inventory valuation allowances. We ended the year with a balance of $1.4 billion, which includes a small reduction in the fourth quarter. We expect further reductions as we move through 2025, but the pace and magnitude will be dependent on EV demand. We achieved adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.8 billion during the fourth quarter, up $500 million year-over-year, primarily driven by EBIT performance. North America delivered fourth quarter EBIT-adjusted of $2.3 billion, up $300 million year-over-year. We benefited from the absence of 2023's fourth quarter strike in inventory adjustments. Additionally, the fixed cost program contributed to offsetting higher labor and warranty costs. While we remain disciplined on pricing, we faced a slight headwind from full-size truck incentives. I want to take a moment to emphasize the strong full year North American margin of 9.2%, well within our targeted 8% to 10% range. We are executing well on our product launches along with being disciplined on costs, pricing and inventory levels. Our broad and refreshed product portfolio is a key factor driving these strong results. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a margin of 5.8%. This included certain discrete items, including breach of warranty and legal reserves, which roughly impacted margin by 1.3 percentage points. I'd now like to discuss the continued higher warranty costs, which include the initial product warranty accrual, recall campaigns and breach of warranty exposure. Despite our success, we know we have an opportunity to improve our results by aggressively targeting our warranty expense. The first priority is always our customers, focusing on parts availability. At the same time, the team is actively working to tackle the root cause of issues as they arise. Our commitment starts with the initial quality of our products, an area where we are a leader in the industry. We've achieved a significant reduction in claims with a decrease in the U.S. of over 30% since 2018. However, this benefit has been more than offset by 100% increase in the cost of repair, driven by both parts and labor inflation over the same period. Rest assured, we remain committed to finding ways to mitigate inflationary pressures and navigate the strict regulatory and legal landscape. We are optimistic that our intense focus on driving down repair costs and improving quality will reduce our warranty costs over time. GM International delivered fourth quarter EBIT-adjusted of $200 million, driven by strong execution and tight cost controls in South America and the Middle East, along with positive China equity income of $17 million excluding the restructuring charge. The team in China has done a great job of reducing inventory, with SGM's inventories down over 60% from the end of 2023. They have implemented effective cost reductions and have been focusing on enhancing product competitiveness, which helped fourth quarter sales increase 40% sequentially versus the third quarter. We recorded a $4.1 billion special item in our auto China equity income. Approximately half of this related to an impairment, while the rest is connected to various restructuring actions we have taken so far in China. It's important to note that these charges are not expected to require any capital from GM as the joint venture has sufficient cash to cover these costs. We believe these actions, along with a comprehensive product launch plan in 2025 that ensures at least one NEV option per product program, will help us achieve our target of the China business returning to profitability in 2025. GM Financial also had a strong year of profitability and capital returned to GM. Fourth quarter EBT-adjusted was consistent year-over-year at $700 million. Higher net financing revenue offset lower lease termination gains and higher provision expense, driven by increased loan origination volume. GM Financial's full year EBT-adjusted was $3.0 billion, at the top of their guidance range, and they paid dividends of $1.8 billion to GM. Cruise expenses, excluding the special items for the restructuring charge, were $400 million in the quarter, down from $800 million in 2023. As Mary said, we believe our refocused autonomous driving strategy will lead to efficiencies and $1 billion annual run rate savings in our investment relative to the $1.7 billion we spent on Cruise in 2024. These decisions led to a $500 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, which was classified as a special item with approximately two-thirds being cash based. Additionally, later this year, we plan to include the expenditures for the Cruise employees in our North America segment. This will impact our North America margin by around 50 basis points this year. However, we still expect to remain within our 8% to 10% range. It will also increase our auto fixed costs and reduce our adjusted automotive cash flow as the cash used by Cruise was excluded previously. Moving to our 2025 guidance, we expect EBIT-adjusted in the $13.7 billion to $15.7 billion range, EPS-diluted-adjusted to be in the $11 to $12 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $11 billion to $13 billion range. It's important to note that our guidance does not account for the impact of future policy changes by the new administration, including tariffs, tax reform or other regulation changes. We do anticipate some headwinds in both volume and mix, stemming from a modest decline in ICE wholesale volume in North America as we appropriately balance dealer inventory levels. However, this will be partially offset by higher EV volume. We're optimistic in our robust product portfolio and our ability to drive market share expansion through strong ICE sales, complemented by a strategically diverse lineup of EVs. Additionally, we are planning for a similar U.S. industry year-over-year to 2024. In terms of pricing, we're assuming a decline in North America of 1% to 1.5% year-over-year to capture potentially higher incentives or a moderation in ATPs. While we are not seeing this at the moment, we believe it's a prudent way to plan our budget as we have in years past. Offsetting these headwinds, we anticipate EV profitability improvements at the low end of our $2 billion to $4 billion EBIT year-over-year target. This improvement is based on wholesales of around 300,000 units and is predicted to come from scale, fixed cost absorption and a continued focus on cell and vehicle cost reductions. Regarding Cruise, our guidance includes around $500 million of the $1 billion annual savings we previously discussed. This is based on our assumption that Cruise employees will be fully integrated into GM by mid-year. We anticipate other costs outside of Cruise and the EV profitability improvements to be favorable. This is mainly due to variable costs such as commodities and logistics, which are expected to more than offset headwinds from depreciation and amortization and higher labor costs. For GM International, we expect a tailwind from restructuring the China business and are targeting profitable equity income for the full year. GM International outside of China should be similar to what was delivered in 2024. For GM Financial, we expect EBT-adjusted to be in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range, reflecting the targeted return for the credit risk profile and asset mix in a largely stable economic environment. We expect an increase in earning assets, driven by both loan and lease portfolios. We are forecasting another year of robust adjusted automotive free cash flow. However, we anticipate year-over-year headwinds in the range of $1 billion to $3 billion from the non-repeat of working capital benefits realized in 2024, primarily from dealer inventory restocking, the timing of payments for previously accrued liabilities, notably warranty and the inclusion of Cruise spend. Capital spending is expected to be similar year-over-year and in the $10 billion to $11 billion range, including battery JV investments. We continue to strategically spend on our ICE portfolio and build flexibility into our manufacturing capabilities to maintain agility to adapt to consumer preferences between ICE and EV powertrains. Our full year EPS guidance assumes weighted average diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares, which excludes the impact of any future open market purchases. In closing, I want to express my sincere gratitude to every GM team member. Their hard work and dedication have been pivotal in driving our strong financial performance in 2024. Our relentless focus on execution, discipline and adaptability has enabled us to successfully navigate a dynamic and challenging landscape, and we believe these key success factors are going to continue to support our efforts towards another promising year in 2025. This concludes our opening comments, and we'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open. Dan Levy : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Wanted to start with a question on the guidance and specifically if we could double-click on the volume assumptions. I know you're talking about headwinds, but I'm wondering if we could maybe get a sense of the magnitude. The third-party data forecasters have your North America production down 9% for 2025. I know a lot of that is just non-repeat of inventory build. Maybe you can just give us a sense of what type of SAAR and share assumptions you have? And then maybe if you can just comment specifically on the share? It was really strong in the fourth quarter. Is there any sustainability to that? Paul Jacobson : Hey, Dan, thanks for the question. You were getting a little garbled at the end, I think bad cell connection, but I think you were asking about SAAR assumptions for '25 and then the share uplift that we saw at the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, how sustainable is that. So, we're looking at 2025 on a SAAR basis to be fairly similar to 2024. I think there is some speculation out there that we saw a big pull ahead in demand in the month of December, whether that was EV-driven or just consumer-driven ahead of inauguration. I think one of the things is we're adopting a little bit of a wait and see on that. January has been really noisy, as Mary had mentioned in comments this morning about both the weather, the fires in California, et cetera. So, it's tough to glean whether there was a big pull-forward. So, we've kind of projected demand to be pretty similar to last year. On the share side, I think really proud of the team. They have done a tremendous job. And as we've said for a few years, as we have been able to ramp up EVs, we saw the opportunity to grow share in EVs and ICE, and that was not mutually exclusive. And I think the team has been doing that. We are at a share level that we haven't seen, if you exclude COVID since 2018. I think that's tremendous results. I think the team is not going to stop there, but we're going to continue to work towards that. Going forward, I think we were projecting an opportunity or some pretty big ICE impacts from not having as much restocking. I think we're going to kind of wait and see to where demand is. We obviously do have an opportunity to build a little bit of inventory within the 50- to 60-day window that we've outlined at year-end as a result of that demand surge that we saw in 4Q, but we're going to kind of watch that. But other than that, I think a pretty similar environment in '25 than what we experienced in '24. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. As a follow-up, a bit of a policy question. I know you're waiting to see how everything plays out, but President Trump has said he's reversing the EV mandate. I think we all expect some reversal in the tax credits, perhaps some change in EPA. In this environment, can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about resource allocation toward EVs? How much overhead spend can you pull back on? Just how the strategy shifts amid a potential change in EV policy? Mary Barra : Well, I think you've seen us over the last few years be very mindful of what consumer demand is for EVs and make decisions like we did with Orion and like the third plant that we're in the process of selling our share to LG. So, we're going to continue to make decisions like that to be appropriate with our capital. As we look at how EVs are going to grow, we never expect it would be a straight line. We're also going to deploy capital appropriately to our ICE portfolio. I think we have the strongest portfolio General Motors has had in decades. Maybe I'm a little biased there, but I think we're seeing that with the response in the market as well. So, we're going to continue to be very efficient as we deploy capital to both ICE and EV, again, guided by the consumer demand. Dan Levy : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. Good morning. My first question on the -- this margin exit rate in 2024. Without sort of any large LC and RV charges like you had last year or the strike and strong ATPs in the quarter, I think some investors may have expected a bit of a higher exit rate in terms of margin. I know you mentioned about [130] (ph) basis point of one-time-type items. Can you just come back and comment on the quarter performance? And to what extent -- I guess, what would the bridge look like towards 8% to 10% in 2025? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Good morning, Emmanuel. Not surprised about this question. We did say in the remarks that there were two specific issues really around warranty and policy. One was a legal settlement on the oil consumption case, which we recorded in the fourth quarter. That'll be in our 10-K. And then the second is, we've continued to see some breach of warranty pressure as we talked about in the regulatory and legal environment. We're trying to get a little bit ahead of that just based on the trends that we see. Those two items in and of themselves were a little bit more than 1 point as we talked about. That kind of puts us in line with normal seasonality. I'd also point out, remember that we had, I think we disclosed, about $300 million in 3Q that was a pull-forward of vehicles that were expected to deliver in the fourth quarter. That benefited September in Q3 at the expense of Q4. And then lastly, normal seasonality, we've got 11 fewer production days, just generally based on the holiday schedule. Remember, we lost a couple of days at Arlington because of the floods in North Carolina and the tragedy that impacted that community and a supplier that we had there. So, I'm not overly worked up about it. I think when you look at some of those one-off events, I think we're pretty good. The one thing I do want to say, because I know we've received some inbound questions, EV mix wasn't really a meaningful factor in that 4Q. It does have a downward impact, but it was really outweighed significantly by those pressures that I just highlighted. So that hopefully gives a little bit more confidence in the construct going forward for 2025. Emmanuel Rosner : I appreciate this color. Second question is around capital allocation. So, it was good to hear you restate the capital allocation policy and seems like based on the guided CapEx and sort of like other actions, it would leave again some considerable amount of capital to return to shareholders. I think you're probably through most of your existing authorizations for buybacks. So, what would be the next step here? Mary Barra : Well, Emmanuel, thanks for the question. We're really proud of the strong free cash flow generation that we had in 2024, and we expect another year of very strong free cash flow. And we're going to continue to follow our capital allocation policy. So, we'll be working with the board on the next phase and we'll provide updates as we move forward. But you can look to us following the capital allocation framework as we've done this year -- or I should say done in 2024. Emmanuel Rosner : Yes. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Spak with UBS. Your line is open. Joe Spak : Thank you. Good morning. Just one quick one on the quarter and then a bigger picture one. GMNA pricing in the quarter, I think when you showed some of the pricing data in the sales release, it looked like things are really strong, accelerating through the quarter, incentives were low, yet -- and the factor was still a slight year-over-year headwind. Was there any incentive accrual or anything in the quarter that weighed on that? And maybe related to pricing also the 1% to 1.5% for 2025, does that include -- is that overall like including the EV portfolio? And do you expect some pricing on pressure on EVs? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. What I would say is there is a little bit of noise in the sort of year-over-year interplay in the accrual on the inventory for incentives. But commercially, I think everything that you mentioned is right. It was a strong year for pricing across the board and strong demand in the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue going forward in pricing. For the 1% to 1.5%, you'll notice that that's down a little bit from the way we've haircut in prior years. I think that's a statement that we expect a little bit more stability as our competitors have worked down some of their higher inventory balances. So, we expect a year of a little bit more stability. The down 1% to 1.5%, I would remind you is just kind of the way we look at a planning assumption. It's not necessarily in our expectations, but it's how we run the business and how we guide the business going forward so that we can adjust if we see that, but not necessarily an indication of the commercial market. Like I said, January, the pricing has been good. In fact, I think ATPs were up a little bit, incentives were down a little bit, but there's just so much noise in it. We're just -- we're being cautious until we get a little bit more smooth data from the marketplace just because January was so noisy. Joe Spak : Okay. And just going back to policy, and I know you're not going to do anything without prudence here. You're going to take some careful evaluation and have profitability and capital efficiency in mind. I just was wondering if you could spend a minute talking about the flexibility you have in your footprint. We know about the ICE-EV flexibility, because you showed us that in Tennessee, but I'm curious a little bit more about just shifting mix of production between plants, especially on the full-size vehicles, which are produced across North America, if there are any sort of near-term actions on tariffs, et cetera? Mary Barra : Yeah, Joe, it's a good question. And we've been studying multiple scenarios, but from a Mexico perspective, we do build trucks in Mexico and in Canada and in the United States. And so, we have the capacity in the United States to ship some of that. We also sell trucks globally, and so we can look at where the international markets are being sourced from. So, there's plays that we can do on that perspective to minimize the impact if there are tariffs either on Canada or Mexico. We're encouraged that President Sheinbaum of Mexico has indicated that they are working and having conversations to take the steps necessary that the Trump administration is looking for specifically around immigration and some other things to avoid the tariffs, but we're doing the planning and have several levers that we can pull. Joe Spak : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open. John Murphy : Good morning, everybody. And sorry to stay on the mundane topic of policy, but just trying to understand the baseline of where you're starting, where you're assuming policy doesn't change. I mean, Trump through the Unleash America Energy executive order essentially canceled CARB's waiver, so they can't execute on the ACC2. Was your understanding that you do not have to comply with CARB's ACC2 and get to 35% of your volume as EVs in California and the other states? And just what is your interpretation there and how are you going to operate going forward? Because obviously that ratches up to 45% next year and then 100% by 2035. Mary Barra : Yeah, our message to President Trump and the administration is that as EV requirements are changed, we've got to make sure that the stringency is as well. Frankly, even in today's environment before anything changes, what's happening from a card perspective across multiple states is just not where the customer is at. And we've been engaging at the state level, our dealers have been engaging at the state level. And so, there's a tremendous amount of work going on in that. As it relates to what specifically has happened through executive order, I think there's still some more policy work that needs to be done, so we can comply and make sure we're not in a penalty situation, which we're watching carefully. But don't disagree with you that I think there's directional change coming. It's just it's not completely done yet, but we're watching and providing our input at the state level and the federal level. John Murphy : But your understanding, Mary, is right now that the 35% requirement that would have been put in place is actually not in place at the moment, right, because of that executive order? Is that how you guys are operating? I just want to make sure I understand that. Mary Barra : Actually, no, because I think there is legislative or legal changes or policy by different organizations that has to align with that. We're very clear on the direction, but I don't think we can as an auto manufacturer right now can assume that that is gone at this precise moment. John Murphy : Yeah, very uncertain. Just one last one, Mary, quickly on the AV commitment. Obviously, there's a lot of costs that are being poured across from Cruise into the company. So, you're getting some good savings, but you're still spending a lot of money on ADAS and Level 3 to ultimately Level 4 and 5 autonomy. Are you still having internal commitments to developing Level 4 and 5 on your own and sort of a build, or is there the potential that you think you might need to go out and buy just given the way that you're going after this at the moment? Mary Barra : Well, John, it's a great question. And I think even with what we saw yesterday, there is so much happening from an artificial intelligence perspective of how we move forward. We do and have built the capability inside General Motors. Obviously, our plan that we're working to execute with Cruise would strengthen that, much of what we can do. There may be strategic partners that we also work with on aspects of this. And so, we want to be leaders in Level 4 autonomy and we think we're going to continue to evaluate the landscape to do that as capital efficiently as possible, but still maintain a leadership position and also the strong relationship with the customer because we think that this is game changing for our industry. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Adam Jonas : Yeah. I just wanted to follow-up on Murph's line of questioning around autonomy. I think you said you had 360,000 enabled vehicles with Super Cruise on the road and you expect to double that in 2025, and that you're moving to a -- from a foundation -- or moving to a foundation and end-to-end approach training your massive datasets. Can you tell us how moving to end-to-end might change your spending? How you approach compute costs? You alluded to, Mary, working with strategic partners. I think that resonates, too. But maybe elaborate a little further on what that might mean to the bottom-line or how you're allocating capital over the next 12 or 24 months? And then, as -- and also I assume most of those 360,000 units are ICE vehicles. So, I'm wondering if in your answer you can include is there any significance or difference, disadvantage if you will of collecting data from non-software-defined ICE vehicles versus your completely new architecture kind of EV-architectured vehicles for training. Thanks. Mary Barra : Thanks, Adam. And from the last question, we can collect information. Of course, we're following all the appropriate policy guidelines and rules that we have within General Motors to make sure that we treat customers' data appropriately. But we can anonymize the data and leverage it to not only improve the performance, but to improve the safety. And we're really proud of where we are with Super Cruise with our safety record and the fact that we have some features like towing that no one else has. We're going to continue to build on those. I mentioned something that's coming as an improvement from a driver-assist technology yet this year. And we're going to continue and think we can accelerate that if we are able to execute our plan to incorporate the great talent that we have at Cruise for getting Super Cruise to Level 3, Level 3 plus and beyond. When we talk about -- in our forecast, you asked for the next 12 to 18 months, I think what we shared of the savings that we'll see from not pursuing robotaxi of $1 billion on an annualized run rate, that kind of captures and within the spend that we have is what we think we need to spend from a compute perspective as kind of part of the operating budget. So, we're going to continue to evaluate it as we saw yesterday, and I mentioned that there's so much change that's happening in this space right now. Anything that we can do to be more efficient with the spend, of course, we're going to seize that opportunity, but we remain committed to autonomy because we do think it has such a dramatic impact from a customer experience perspective for the better and actually changes the margin profile of the business as well. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Just as a follow-up on China. Despite the recent challenges that you've addressed very proactively, GM does have decades of experience in the market and you have many billions of invested capital, lots of people and capacity still in place and IP with your JV partners. President Trump has been open to foreign firms participating in the U.S. as long as they make products in America, if I'm paraphrasing accurately. Do you see scope for GM to help your existing or even new Chinese partners kind of gain access to the U.S. using your existing onshore capacity and distribution capability? I want to see how you'd approach that, maybe it's not so relevant in the next six or 12 months, but longer-term, just given your decades of experience in that market and the relationships that you've built there. Thanks. Mary Barra : Yeah. Adam, what I've always said broadly on trade across the board is give us a level-playing field and let us compete and win based on the strength of our products, the technology, design, loyalty, et cetera. I think what's happening right now with the overcapacity in China and what's happening around the globe and the subsidies that are current, we're not any close to a level-playing field. So, I also think we have the opportunity. As we mentioned last year, we grew both ICE and EV share. And so, I think we're doing a good job of leveraging our capacity that we have in North America. That's where we're going to stay focused, because I think that's what's right for the long term of the industry. I think we all have to get focused on not only where is the vehicle final assembly, where is the supply chain coming from for all of the parts, including battery raw materials, but also where is the IP developed, because understanding where that research and development is done. As I mentioned earlier today in some of my media spots, it's very important from an auto technology, not only for manufacturing this country from an economic security perspective, but a lot of the technology as it relates to national security. So, I think you have to factor all those issues in, but right now, I'm focused on leveraging the capacity that we have with General Motors and our opportunities to grow. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Mary. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is open. Chris McNally : Thanks so much, team. Yeah. Just the question is around -- it seems, Paul, you made it clear that the guide for policy, particularly on the EV front, is sort of status quo. That's clear. Could you just go through then if production is still 300,000 units or wholesale is 300,000 units? What are the specific drivers to the low end of the range already? I mean, $2 billion versus $4 billion assuming no change in policy? Paul Jacobson : Yeah, thanks, Chris. So, when we talked about the journey towards profitability, we first highlighted that back in November of '23, we talked about scale being the most important driver in the short- to medium-term, and then battery cost improvements and other vehicle cost improvements starting to kick in after that. Since that disclosure and certainly what we saw throughout 2024, where we were talking about 200,000 to 300,000 units and came in just a touch below 200,000, but still achieved our variable profit positive, the volume trajectory and the growth, and therefore, the realization of the scale benefits is coming in a little bit slower, so -- and lagged in there. So, with 300,000 units, we think that's a good trajectory based on what we've seen over the last particularly six months as we picked up share in EVs and the vehicle mix is continuing to get a little bit richer with the Escalade IQ, et cetera. We think we can still deliver the low end of that $2 billion to $4 billion of savings improvement, even though it's on lower volume than where we thought we would be more than a year ago and certainly throughout last year. So, going forward, we're going to continue to watch that as many people have asked here on the call, what happens to consumer tax credits, what happens to IRA, et cetera. There's a lot of moving parts out there. What I would say is whether we're talking about IRA or tariffs, we've got multiple playbooks that we have been working on to make sure that we can respond or even anticipate some of those moves. Some of those are very low cost and we can be very flexible with them. Some of them are bigger deals and bigger transactions, like, as Mary mentioned, the transaction with LGES on Ultium Site 3. We've got ways to be able to respond to that. The reason that we guided to the status quo is because there are really infinite permutations on policy and we didn't want to get into advocacy in our guidance. So, this is why we've done it. But rest assured, we've got plans in place and we're continuing to work proactively with the administration and with Congress on what we think are the right things to do, which is preserve American jobs and preserve American innovation. And I think we're a good actor in that space. Chris McNally : Super clear. And then, just as a follow-up is on the composition of '25 wholesale growth. So, it sounds like you're guiding wholesale slight down, obviously, EV wholesale up 100,000. You think of a specific number, but you mentioned ICE down. But one of the things I'm trying to reconcile is the wholesale growth last year was plus 10%, sort of production at mid-single-digit, sales was plus 4%. Was some of that wholesale growth actually EV inventory in channel, so that is one of the issues on the mix in Q4? Just anything you can add around the wholesale growth above production in the second half of the year? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yeah. So, keep in mind, last year, I think we ended at about 49 days of inventory, if I remember correctly. So, we've had a fairly sizable build going in. And to be able to keep that 50- to 60-day target, as you know, coming into the third quarter, we were sitting at about 67 days and we were able to work through that with the demand that we saw in the fourth quarter. So that's -- the overall assumption is that wholesales would be down a little bit because we didn't have that opportunity to build. What I would say is we do have a little bit of an opportunity to build that's not reflected here. We're being cautious about that just until we see the demand outcome and what some of the market going into 2025 is going to be. Like I said, I would have probably rather had a cleaner January month to be able to make some of those calls, but there's just been so much noise with the retail environment, with everything going on weather wise, inauguration, et cetera, that it's just a little bit too soon to call that build. But should we see consistent demand as we would expect, I think there's an opportunity to take some of that ICE wholesale volume up. Chris McNally : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Narayan with RBC. Your line is open. Tom Narayan : Thanks for taking the question. On the North American pricing guidance down 1% to 1.5%, you said you're guiding for ICE volumes down, higher EV volumes. I would think EVs would come in at higher than ICE pricing. So, this presumably means ICE pricing comes down below the 1% to 1.5% guidance. If so, what level of pricing do you see the ICE portfolio in your '25 guidance? Paul Jacobson : I mean -- thanks, Tom. I keep going back to this. When we talk about the pricing assumption, it's really a combination of ATP and the incentive environment. And what we found that has worked well for us in our internal planning and the setup is to assume that we see a little bit of pricing pressure going forward because it's easier for us to react. So, what I would say is, yeah, we would expect a consistent ATP environment from what we've seen going forward, but we've modeled in the risk or the assumption that there's some incentive increases going forward, whether that's market-driven or demand-driven, et cetera. And if we don't see that, I would expect that we'll outperform that assumption as we have in years past. Tom Narayan : Got it. Thanks. And my follow-up on Super Cruise, I appreciate the comments on the adoption rate, et cetera. But wondering to what extent do you think the regulatory kind of system is a support mechanism for Level 2 plus, Level 3. Is this something that could ultimately be the real catalyst that pushes Super Cruise or Level 2, Level 3 down the road? Or do you see this as just being consumer demand driven? Thanks. Mary Barra : We see it being consumer demand driven. I mean, our customers, the bulk of people who have Super Cruise on their vehicles use it on a regular basis. I think it's over 60%. And especially as we get newer and newer -- or I said new features, it is definitely something where -- when people arrive at their destination after using Super Cruise, they're more rested, which is why 80% of our customers say they either wouldn't buy a car without it or they strongly would desire it to be on their next vehicle. And we're going to look at Super Cruise being standard on our EVs from a Cadillac perspective, the Cadillac or the Escalade IQ, VISTIQ, OPTIQ, LYRIQ-V. So, this is all, I think, opportunity for us for more people to experience Super Cruise and the way we have safely deployed this technology. So, I see it very much consumer-driven. Tom Narayan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Delaney : Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. The $2 billion to $4 billion of EV savings year-over-year the company was initially targeting for 2025 was driven about half by volume-related drivers. So, as you're thinking about the $2 billion and expecting some EV wholesale growth, can you give us a bit more of a sense of how much of that $2 billion is coming from volume and how much is from other factors like materials and battery savings? And then, to the extent there are changes in the policy environment, any sense you can share around what that might do to your EV volumes going forward? Paul Jacobson : Yeah, good morning, Mark. What I would say is it's probably about evenly split between scale benefits and other initiatives on cell cost efficiencies. We're continuing to ramp up cell site two as we talked about at Investor Day and that's going to provide us some efficiencies going forward. There are some material cost savings that we're starting to bake in, et cetera, but it probably split about 50-50 between there. I think any policy changes, as I said before, there are literally infinite iterations that you can go through in terms of demand, value of credits, where we are on production tax credits, et cetera. So, that's why we've built in the assumption that this is kind of status quo. We'll react to that which we can, but we're going to continue to watch this. But this is our best estimate of where we are. And I think that's a good journey, long-term irrespective of what happens as Mary has reiterated many times. This is about providing choice to consumers, and many consumers as we've seen in the share data are opting for our EVs. As a matter of just corporate strategy, we've got to work and we've got to be focused on making sure we get those to profitability. And we're on that journey. And I think the team is making good progress for that. And it's going to require a little bit of time to get there depending on how quickly this scales up. But I think we've seen a tremendous improvement already, and we're anticipating more of that in the future. Mary Barra : Well, and I would also just add that if there are factors that cause EV demand to lessen, we have a great ICE portfolio that we'd happily ramp up production beyond what we have in our current plans for this year. So, again, that's that flexibility that Paul talked about. Mark Delaney : That's all very helpful. And then, could you just be a bit more specific around the assumptions for EV pricing? You spoke already around how you're expecting it for GM in total, but it'd be helpful to have a better sense of the baseline assumptions around EV pricing. And if the industry pricing does get more competitive to the extent there are policy changes that could help us to better think through what EV profitability year-over-year may move to the extent there is more difficult pricing? Thanks. Paul Jacobson : Yeah, I think we're assuming fairly consistent pricing on EVs from what we've seen. And there is a lot of, what I would say, irrational incentive behavior out there in the market. Depending on what policy changes happen around stringency regulations, et cetera, we might see some of that incentive behavior tamped down, because it's clear that people are out there selling EVs really for the sole purpose of compliance. So, I think there are a lot of changes going forward. We're continuing to just keep our head down, focus on building great products. And as you've seen from the chart that we included in the earnings deck, I would put our incentive discipline and our go-to-market strategies up against anybody in the industry in terms of the type of performance that our team is driving. Mark Delaney : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ryan Brinkman : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, which is on China. It looks like you gained some pretty solid sequential traction there with sales rising 40% from 3Q, driven by inexpensive EVs such as the Wuling Bingo. What is the profitability though of vehicles such as the Bingo or the Hongguang Mini EV look like? I'm just curious, what are the ways you can capitalize upon these high-volume, but low-priced and I'm presuming low-profit vehicles. Do you maybe benefit on the financing side, or expect to benefit over time from aftermarket parts and services? Some other automakers have mentioned similarly priced vehicles in China might be unprofitable, but they can then make money when exporting them to higher cost markets. So, it looks like some good commercial traction, but just curious your thoughts on the best way to take advantage of this brighter area of the China sales picture. Mary Barra : Sure. Well, Ryan, we don't talk about individual product profitability, but I would say that our joint venture with Wuling is -- Wuling is known to be an incredibly efficient and low-cost producer and to do that well. If you look at their whole portfolio, it kind of is in that space. So, I think there's -- they're one of the leaders, I think, in doing that well before some of the other growth. And those are vehicles that are very popular with consumers as well. As you mentioned, there's of all opportunities in addition to the profitability on the vehicle to continue to drive favorability. So, beyond that, I can't comment on its specific profitability. We do work with Wuling and source some vehicles from Wuling to other markets, international markets, working with us to make sure the product meet the standards for each of those different countries and we've been successful doing that. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Thank you. Maybe lastly, a quick follow-up on your comments regarding capital allocation. I'm curious how some of the uncertainty surrounding regulation, particularly tariffs, could affect your thinking there. Might you potentially want to operate with more than the targeted $18 billion of gross cash for a time? Or are you thinking any differently about the planned cadence of repurchases in 2025 until we gain greater clarity, maybe as soon as April 1st as per one of the executive orders signed last Monday, or just how are you thinking about this? Paul Jacobson : Yeah. Hey, Ryan. What I would say is our stated liquidity goals alongside our revolving credit facilities are a target that includes a whole host of risks and things that might happen to us. And when you look at the liquidity we had going into COVID, for example, that was enough at the time to get us that time going forward. So, we're not anticipating having to build cash in anticipation of a big draw. And I would say it's going to be continued business as usual. We're going to have to execute going forward. As others mentioned, we do have still a little bit of capacity left under the buyback and we're going to continue to work with the Board and allocate capital. But our free cash flow generation is strong and we expect to continue to allocate that and ultimately share that with our investors. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mary Barra for her closing comments. Mary Barra : Thank you. And I want to close by thanking our team once again for their strong execution in 2024, which has set the business up for continued success in 2025. If you step back and look, we have a broad, deep and compelling portfolio of internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs to meet customer demand and it keeps getting stronger with the strength of our products. We continue to innovate and we're growing technologies like Super Cruise for today and L3 for the future, even moving to L4. We're profit-focused and we're capital-disciplined with strong margins, cash flow and a healthy balance sheet. And I want to remind everybody, we have demonstrated our agility many times over the last several years. And although there's a lot of uncertainty with some of the uncertainty, there's pluses in the column as what not just negatives. And we intend to capitalize on all of that. And that's why I believe that 2025 is a year that is full of promise for General Motors and I look forward to sharing our progress with you and demonstrating once again how much the General Motors team is capable of delivering. So, thank you again for joining, and I hope you all have a great day. Stay safe. Operator : That concludes the conference call for today. Thank you for joining.",
