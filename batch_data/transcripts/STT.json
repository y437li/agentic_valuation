(Operator Instructions) Now, I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street. Please go ahead. Valerie Haertel - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations : Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our first quarter earnings materials include a slide presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all the financial information discussed on today\u2019s webcast will reflect operating basis results.

We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, April 25, 2014. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley. Jay Hooley - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Valerie and good morning everyone. During the quarter, our results were affected by a constrained investment environment in seasonal expense factors. However, we continue to execute on our key priorities of growing our core business, controlling our expenses, investing in growth areas and optimizing our capital structure to deliver long-term shareholder value. The environment during the first quarter was mixed. Global equity and fixed income markets were up slightly and investor risk taking behavior had a negative bias until the end of the quarter when investors began to move back into emerging markets. While volatility improved from the fourth quarter and helped our trading business, it remained constrained hitting a 7-year low during the quarter. Concerns about the Ukrainian growth in China similar throughout the quarter, but there were no significant impacts on the geopolitical front. On the State Street front, we experienced seasonal expense increases in the first quarter as well as continued pressure on regulatory expenses. As a result of this tepid environment, we have taken action to further align our expense base by announcing this morning a reduction of 400 positions. We are committed to aggressively managing our costs and we will continue to evaluate additional opportunities to create efficiencies to position us to achieve our goal of creating positive operating leverage year-over-year. The constrained environment and increasing regulatory requirements are also putting pressure on our clients. Consequently, we continue to see steady demand for our products and services around the globe. Our first quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $189 billion representing a range of clients and sectors. 38% of those assets were from outside the U.S. Included in our new business wins are 25 new alternative servicing mandates, a client segment where we continue to see above average long-term growth potential. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $136 billion. During the quarter, we saw outflows from money market funds into long-term funds. However, as the quarter progressed, the flows into long-term funds shifted from equities to fixed income out of emerging markets funds and into mature markets, which is indicative of continued cautious investor behavior. As mentioned, we did see some movement back into emerging market equity funds at the end of the quarter. In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $4 billion for the first quarter driven primarily by strong inflows of $35 billion into cash collateral pools offset by $31 billion in outflows from ETFs and institutional mandates primarily passive equity. The net ETF flows of approximately $19 billion reflected typical seasonal activity in our S&P 500 fund. In this continued challenging environment, our objectives for 2014 are to drive growth in the core business, continue to mine efficiencies across the organization, including executing on our ops and IT transformation program, invest in growth areas and deliver positive operating leverage on an annual basis. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike who will discuss our actions more fully and review our financial performance. Mike Bell - Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. This morning, before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included a pre-tax severance expense of approximately $72 million related to staff reductions and realignment. As Jay noted, this action was taken to help mitigate environmental pressures and to align our expense base with our current revenue outlook. We continue to focus on one of our key priorities which is to support positive operating leverage on an annual basis in 2014. On Page 11, I will begin the discussion of our operating basis highlights and I will reference our non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments unless I note otherwise. EPS for the first quarter of 2014 declined $0.99 per share from $1.15 in the fourth quarter of 2013 and increased from $0.96 a share in the first quarter of 2013. Our first quarter results in 2013 and 2014 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp and payroll taxes. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, the increase in operating basis EPS was primarily driven by a reduction in average outstanding shares due to common stock repurchase program. First quarter 2014 total revenue increased 1.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 and 3.6% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Total expenses increased in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior quarter primarily due to an incremental $157 million related to incentive comp and payroll taxes, of which $146 million is associated with the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. During the first quarter of 2014, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $420 million resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $439 million for the quarter. In March 2014, our Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015. Turning now to Slide 12, I will discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for the first quarter of 2014 focusing on the notable variances principally from the fourth quarter. First quarter 2014 servicing fees were up modestly compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to stronger global equity markets and net new business partially offset by lower transaction-related revenue. First quarter 2014 management fees increased modestly from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to net new business and stronger global equity markets partially offset by lower performance fees. Performance fees in the first quarter of 2014 were approximately $3 million, down from $5 million in the prior quarter. Additionally, first quarter 2014 management fees were impacted by money market fee waivers of $10 million compared to $13 million in the prior quarter. Trading services revenue increased by almost 5% compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue from higher volumes and volatility. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, trading services revenue was lower primarily due to lower foreign exchange trading revenue and lower distribution fees associated with the SPDR Gold ETF. Securities finance revenue increased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to higher spreads and volumes. Securities on loan averaged $333 billion in the first quarter of 2014 up approximately 6% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Processing fees and other revenue increased approximately 20% from the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to an increase in revenue from joint ventures, tax-advantaged investments and certain portfolio transition services. Our net interest revenue decreased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to $19 million of interest revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 associated with the municipal security that previously been impaired and lower yields on interest earning assets. I also reiterate the two net interest revenue scenarios that we reviewed at our February Investor Day. In our first scenario, we assume a modest improvement in market interest rates but not administer grades later in 2014. And we would expect full year NIR to be $25 million to $50 million lower than 2013 adjusted NIR of $2.289 billion. The second scenario assumes a static interest rate environment at 2013 year end levels for the remainder of 2014. And we would then expect our full year NIR to be $50 million to $100 million lower than the 2013 adjusted NIR of $2.289 billion. Our operating basis net interest margin in the first quarter of 2014 was 124 basis points. And as a result of the persistent low interest rate environment we expect the net interest margin to continue to move forward into market interest rate rise. Average interest earning assets increased from the fourth quarter which was primarily driven by higher levels of client deposits. And I\u2019ll now update you on how we\u2019re positioned relative to the liquidity coverage ratio or LCR. We expect to be above the 80% minimum requirement for the LCR as of January 1, 2015. This will likely result in a higher level of high quality liquid assets on the balance sheet which will have a negative impact on net interest revenue and this impact is reflected in our full year estimates. Now let\u2019s turn to operating basis expenses on Slide 13. Our total expenses for the first quarter of 2014 increased approximately 9% sequentially primarily due to seasonal deferred compensation expense and payroll taxes and higher information systems and transaction processing expenses. Our first quarter 2014 compensation and employee benefits expenses increased from the fourth quarter 2013 primarily due to an incremental $157 million related to deferred incentive comp and payroll taxes of which $146 million is associated with seasonal deferred incentive comp expense for retirement and eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compensation and employee benefits expenses continues to be impacted by costs associated with installing new business, investing in growth opportunities and implementing additional regulatory and compliance requirements. Our business operations and IT transformation program continues to be on track and for full year 2014 we expect to achieve approximately $130 million of additional pretax expense savings which would result in approximately $550 million of run rate savings since the inception of the program. Information systems expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily reflecting the planned transition of certain functions to external service providers as well as higher maintenance costs associated with the new technology implemented that is part of the business ops and IT transformation program. Transaction processing expenses increased from the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase primarily reflects higher volumes and higher equity values in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expenses of $114 million in the first quarter of 2014 decreased sequentially primarily due to the effect of a one-time $8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 and a $4 million credit in the first quarter of 2014 each associated with a sublease renegotiation. Other expenses decreased to $283 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to lower securities processing, sales promotion and professional services costs. I\u2019d also note that fourth quarter 2013 operating basis other expenses included $28 million of Lehman Brothers-related gains and recoveries which was essentially offset by higher securities processing costs. Now I\u2019ll provide you some details on our March 31, 2014 balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 14, our overall approach managing our investment portfolio has not changed and we maintained a high credit quality profile. Our interest rate risk position was also in line with our position at year end. Additionally, the after tax unrealized mark to market gain as of March 31, was $124 million, which improved from the year end, due primarily due to narrower spreads in the first quarter. And I will turn to the next slide to review your capital position. As you can see we maintained a strong capital position and that strength has allowed us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of March 31, 2014 our estimated pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 11.1% under the standardized approach and 13.2% under the advanced approach. Both capital ratios improved from the fourth quarter primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 common equity. This increase included a temporary 20% phase-in of the deduction of other intangible assets from Tier 1 common equity as allowed by the phase-in rules. Previously, our pro forma ratios included 100% deduction of intangibles which will be required by the Basel III rules once the reduction is fully phased in. Therefore, the improvement of approximately 100 basis points due to the phase-in will completely disappear by 2018. On April 8, regulators released the 5% and 6% supplemental leverage ratio requirements for certain bank holding companies and insured depository institutions. At the same time, a notice of proposed rule making was issued to codify the calculation of the denominator of the SOR and in the NPR the ability to use a daily average of total assets is included which is positive for us. But unfortunately central bank placements were not excluded. We estimate that our pro forma Basel III supplementary leverage ratio under our interpretation of the U.S. proposed rules issued on April 8 are approximately 6.4% at the holding company and approximately 6.0% at the bank as of March 31, 2014. The improvement in the leverage ratios is primarily due to the temporary capital benefit for the intangibles, the more favorable treatment of unfunded commitments, the use of the daily average of total assets and the issuance of preferred stock during the quarter. Partially offsetting these improvements was a larger average balance sheet driven primarily by the higher level of client deposits. Now, we are pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan that we submitted in conjunction with the 2014 CCAR. In line with our capital plan, our Board approved the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015. Additionally, we will seek approval from our Board in May to increase the second quarter common stock dividend to $0.30 per share, up from $0.26 per common share that was declared in the first quarter. Next I will reference Slide 16 where we detail a change in the presentation of our operating basis effective tax rate. Beginning with the first quarter of 2014 we changed the calculation of the operating basis effective tax rate by reflecting the tax equivalent adjustment that is included in operating basis revenue. This change has no impact on operating basis revenue, pretax earnings or EPS. We believe the change will better align our operating basis effective tax rate with our other operating basis metrics and will provide a more informative measure of the ordinary rate of tax generated by State Street business activity. On this basis, the operating basis, tax rate was 31.2% in the first quarter of 2014. Before I conclude, I would like to address the question which maybe on investors and analyst\u2019s minds regarding our expense outlook for the remainder of 2014. Excluding the first quarter seasonal, deferred compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes, we expect that expenses will increase in the last three quarters of 2014, primarily due to annual salary increases which are effective in April. We do expect to realize savings of approximately $22 million in 2014 from the staffing reductions announced today. I would note that we expect to achieve the majority of the $22 million of savings in the second half of the year and then expect $40 million of annualized benefit in 2015. Overall, for the full year 2014, we continued to target 3% to 5% revenue growth and positive operating leverage. And while the environment continues to present challenges we plan to continue to focus on our top priorities, (driving) more revenue growth, investing in growth opportunities, controlling expenses, and managing our strong capital position. The expenses actions that we announced today reflect the current environment and put us in a better position to deliver on our goal to achieve positive operating leverage on an annual basis in 2014. Now I am turning the call back to Jay. Jay Hooley - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks Mike. Stephanie, Mike and I are now prepared to handle questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI Group. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group : First one is a quickie. I just want to make sure I heard your comments right, Mike, so full \u2013 on a fully phased in basis the capital ratios on the slide are about 100 basis points lower, still strong, but is that correct? Mike Bell : That is correct Glenn. In terms of the Basel III risk weighted ratios in particular. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group : Yes, cool. And then just wanted to make sure that you are still according to the (annuals) that you had mentioned that you still have some more preferred to issue, I just want to make sure that that is still in the cards. And then an add-on question to that is how you balance the capital efficiency benefits with the earnings dilution and I am asking just because I see a lot of people short of their 1.5% bucket, but not issuing because you can\u2019t get back all the capital, what\u2019s the point. Mike Bell : Sure. So Glenn, the overall answer is that our position on preps has not changed since the Investor Day. So as we talked about it at the Investor Day, we do expect to add at least $500 million over time for the preps to get to that 1.5% which we view as optimal in terms of the Basel III risk weighted capital ratios. Now really the key question when I say at least $500 million the key question is going to be the supplementary leverage ratio since the preps that we issue do count towards the SOR. There is an incentive. There is an economic incentive over time for us to potentially have issue additional preps which over the fullness of time we would expect to enable us to reduce the common equity that we have outstanding. And so in terms of your question on timing that is obviously something that we are looking at and we will continue to review our options. And again I would say that if we are really looking at this in terms of long-term shareholder value, it\u2019s a good trade to make the trade relative preps for common stock and the dilution is something that we think at this point is manageable, but it will be factored into decision going forward. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group : Right, last one is this is good thing the asset management fees were up more than the assets under management which I haven\u2019t seen in a long time, that\u2019s a good thing. In the tax it doesn\u2019t say that it\u2019s a performance fees, so is that just a function of mix and selling higher margin product? Jay Hooley : Yes, I would say if you recall Glenn from our Investor Day we featured (indiscernible) presentation that we have \u2013 we are less concerned about pure AUM and more concerned about revenue per unit of AUM. And we have intentionally focused on higher yielding products mostly through ETF vehicles. And we continue to push those out and that had the effect of improving the revenue per AUM which we think is good and we think we will continue to focus on. Glenn Schorr - ISI Group : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Hi, good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Mike, I just want to be super clear here. When you are talking about expenses moving up off of the first quarter base and you said excluding stock comp and payroll taxes, what\u2019s that explicit number that we should use to build off of? Mike Bell : Thanks Ken. So what I would suggest \u2013 this is how I would suggest when you think about it Ken is I would take the first quarter comp and employee benefits number, I would back out the \u2013 let me just think about this for a second. I would back out the $146 million of 55 and 5, the retirement eligible comp that\u2019s embedded in there. And then I would think about adding approximately $21 million a quarter for the merit increases and importantly as you go from Q1 to Q2 we\u2019ll have an additional payroll day and that\u2019s worth about $5 million. So that\u2019s how I would think about I mean there are obviously other pluses and minuses but I am trying to answer your question in terms of how to think about the baseline. I would make those adjustments as a starting point for Q2. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks while we will get savings in 2014 they will be from the expense actions. The reduction enforce of a net 400 FTEs we\u2019ll get benefit from that in 2014 that\u2019s mainly in the second half of the year and then we get an additional $18 million in the full year 2015 that we don\u2019t get in the full year 2014. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Since I want to confirm but as you had said payroll taxes as well, so but the only thing we should really be backing out from the first quarter is just the $146 million? Mike Bell : Yes. In the $146 million includes the seasonal effect of the payroll taxes on everybody. So what we look to focus on and with that $146 million number which is apples-to-apples with $118 million the year before is it\u2019s the deferred comp for everybody is retirement eligible and it\u2019s the seasonal bump up in payroll taxes that happens in Q1 as a result of flipping over the calendar year and FICA taxes and stuff starting back at zero base. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. And just because I am getting the question a bunch of times, the severance charges are not in that 10.85 number, correct? Mike Bell : That is correct, Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. And then operating expenses were higher than the range that you\u2019ve talked to in the past. Can you give us some color on what your outlook is for that operating expenses number, the other sorry other? Mike Bell : Yes, sure. The other operating expenses Ken first of all continued to be very pressured by these regulatory compliance cost. So again very consistent with what we\u2019ve talked about at the Investor Day. And there is significant upward pressure on that number relative to 2013 levels. So in terms of the outlook for other operating expenses in 2014 it is going to be lumpy I mean it is going to be lumpy because of legal costs, it will be somewhat lumpy for regulatory compliance expenses so and actually lumpy as well because of securities processing costs. So it is one of those \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to give you a quarterly number with a lot of confidence because in any given quarter stuff can go bump and either be good or bad. I would characterize the first quarter though is being roughly in line with what we\u2019re going to see is on a quarterly basis over the course of the remainder of the year based on our current expectations. But I\u2019d say that the big wild cards are really the legal expenses and also the regulatory compliance cost where there is upward pressure. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. And then if I could just wrap a final one together. Your revenue growth was 3.6% and pretty much in that range you\u2019ve talked about. And obviously the expenses were in the 5s and even if you back out that retirement eligible the expenses were still growing 4.5%. So trying to understand then with a negative operating leverage start to the first quarter and the expenses still moving up from here albeit with your modest amount of incremental saves you are getting, what \u2013 what\u2019s your level of confidence that this can flip in the next three quarters and get us to a net positive operating leverage, when you think about revenues versus expenses. It seems like there is still an bad balance here between expense growth and revenue growth? Mike Bell : Sure, Ken. A very important question that you are asking, so the overall answer is we\u2019re continuing to set as a goal for ourselves for the full year positive operating leverage for full year 2014 versus full year 2013. Now importantly as we\u2019ve talked about the Investor Day we are managing though for long-term shareholder value. And which means that we\u2019re going to continue to focus on the strategic plan that we\u2019ve talked about which is sure we want to be the low cost provider in the core activities but it also means that we\u2019re going to also focus on being an innovator of value-added services and which means we\u2019re going to continue to invest. And so in terms of some of the numbers that you talked about I\u2019ll add some additional commentary there. First we do recognize that the Q1 revenue results was at the lower end of our 3% to 5% range that we reiterated at the Investor Day. And importantly Ken I would note that the \u2013 both the revenue and the expenses in Q1 was nominally higher because of the weaker U.S. dollar. So if you actually make it on a constant currency basis for 3.6 and the 5.8 that you referenced are likely 3 and 5. So the point is we recognized that we did not get a lot of help from the revenue environment in Q1. Now we do think that there is some potential help that we could get for the full year revenue outlook. So for example we may get some potential help from equity markets. It was useful that equity markets now are higher than where they were at year end 2013 which was the basis of original 3% to 5% estimate. So that\u2019s useful. We also have not yet seen a material improvement in FX volatility but we would note that the FX volatility is still at a significant cyclical lows; we think there is some upside there. We didn\u2019t see a little bit of help on sec lending spreads in Q1 and again we expect more help in Q2 since that\u2019s the seasonal dividend arm quarter where it\u2019s \u2013 where it is tended to peak so that should help. And then again if we could get some help from market interest rates in the second half of the year we think the revenue outlook could be better than call it 3% that we saw on a constant currency basis in Q1. But importantly Ken I would just reinforce, if the revenue outlook continues to be very soft we will continue to review our operating expense options I mean everything is on the table. We\u2019re \u2013 again we\u2019re managing this for the long-term but we\u2019re also very serious about our goal. So rest assured if we continue to see more 3% kind of scenario than 5% scenario we\u2019ll look harder at operating expenses. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Thank you for all that color, Mike. I appreciate it. Mike Bell : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Good morning guys. So just picking up on the last point I want to dig in into expenses, couple of specific items and maybe wanted on the revenues. So Mike I think when you mentioned is regulatory related costs are still going higher, that\u2019s something different than we heard from the other two trust banks. It sounds like the \u2013 they\u2019re still elevated obviously relative to where they have been kind of last couple of years but it didn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re growing a ton from here. Do you guys still expect that for State Street gets regulatory and legal related items will continue to grow in 2014 versus 2013? Mike Bell : Absolutely, yes Alex. I \u2013 again I won\u2019t comment on any other company\u2019s issues. But I \u2013 it\u2019s virtually certain that ours will be higher and candidly it will be a challenge for us to manage the year-over-year increase in regulatory compliance cost to the $30 million to $40 million that we talked about at the Investor Day. There is real upward pressure on that $30 million to $40 million range. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks for that. And then on the revenue front the two items that I was hoping to spend a few minutes on our \u2013 the brokerage and other and then on securities lending. In brokerage and other I understand there is a couple of things that go in there. This line item has been kind of about 120, 130 range a year ago or so in the last couple of quarters has been closer to 100. So help us understand I guess what\u2019s been the biggest delta there? Is it really all the GLD or there has been some softness in the transition management business as well and then just a quick follow-up in sec lending? Mike Bell : So on the brokerage and other revenue you\u2019re absolutely right, Alex. That category for us was down $30 million versus Q1 a year ago, a little over a third of that is the lower gold fees that we get were mainly reflecting the lower price of gold, but also outflows out of the gold fund. The other call it $19 million is really a combination of as you said lower transition management revenues but also importantly lower electronic exchange revenues. And again we feel like we are well positioned in that market. We see it really as a market phenomenon as opposed to a State Street specific situation. Again, if there is any silver lining to that dark cloud, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s another area where we view as potential upside, if in fact global economic conditions improve. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Right and just Jay Hooley :  Securities lending piece\u2026 Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Yes, I just wanted to get a sense on that\u2019s one of the bright spot I guess in the quarter pretty good growth year-over-year. And I think one of things you talked about at the Investor Day is enhanced custody and I think it was mentioned in your prepared remarks as well. So I was hoping you could either quantify I guess how much that new revenue stream has contributed if at all and maybe help us size the opportunity there? Jay Hooley : Sure. It was a bit of bright spot both sequentially and year-over-year. First time in a while we have seen the online balances up nicely 6% sequentially and you did \u2013 you hit on the key element of the growth, which is in the quarter 25% of our securities lending revenues was driven by enhanced custody and almost all of the growth came through enhanced custody. So I will just remind everybody that\u2019s something that we began that\u2019s began investing three years ago and it\u2019s and we are still investing in it as we bring it into Europe and Asia. But we think it\u2019s a nice addition when we represent a lot of future of the securities lending business. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Great. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Good morning. I had a few clean up questions. First on revenues, can you just size your current asset servicing backlogs and also what is the CVA benefit to servicing fees this quarter? Jay Hooley : Yes, its servicing backlog so committed not installed I believe the $136 million. And as for your other question I wasn\u2019t\u2026 Mike Bell : He is asking Jay about the CVA. The CVA was approximately plus $3 million in the quarter roughly flat sequentially. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, got it. And then just on expenses, I just want to add another basically complete the picture you painted, Mike. Of the $130 million savings, how much have you realized so far this year, could you give us some color there? Mike Bell : Sure, Ashley I would characterize it as we have achieve the substantial majority of that $130 million and overall feel like the full year as well as the remaining $50 million in 2015 are on track at this point. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Got it. And just finally on the occupancy expense line, should we think of $118 million as a starting point ex-credit this quarter? Mike Bell : Yes, I would suggest that\u2019s a good idea. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawkins with UBS. Brennan Hawkins - UBS: So the asset management fee rate. If we adjust gross it up for the fee waivers and adjust for the performance and the day count. We would still down where it had been running the prior three quarters was there anything specific I know it was up year-over-year but versus where it had been in 2Q through 4Q, was there anything specific driving that drop? Mike Bell : Well, so Brennan just to put some facts around it, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks the performance fees are down $2 million sequentially and I would also add that the day count cost us approximately $4 million. So again that would be the main headwind. We didn\u2019t get some help from little lower money market fee waivers as we saw money move out of the government funds and into prime money market, which leads to a little bit better waiver experience. And then some help from markets and also some help from a small amount of help from net new business. Brennan Hawkins - UBS: Yes. I mean grossing up for all those, right I still had fee rate dropping from where it had been running, so I just \u2013 was there anything specific, was it just the flows out of SPY given that that\u2019s a higher fee rate and so it\u2019s a mix function what was it do you think? Mike Bell : We did have some flows out of SPY so that\u2019s \u2013 and that tends to happen at Q1 that\u2019s a pretty common seasonality, seasonal pattern, excuse me. Jay Hooley :  But nothing unusual in the quarter I think it\u2019s fair to look at the year-over-year, if you are not considering trends more in the sequential quarter. Brennan Hawkins - UBS: Okay, thanks Jay. And then on those typical seasonal offers on SPY, is this quarter it\u2019s $19 billion, last year it was $5 billion, is there anything that\u2019s causing that to be so much worse, so much more pronounced than it was last year because we are not seeing anything any other big outflows out of other index products, so I am just kind of curious whether or not you have any insights into what\u2019s making that, maybe a bit more seasonally severe this year? Jay Hooley : I think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there is anything unusual there and in fact after the quarter ended we saw a lot of that come back. So I think it is used as trading account at quarter end. And I think if we look back over several years you would see there is a fair amount of difference in those flows, but we are not reading anything other than, anything trend wise into it. Brennan Hawkins - UBS: Perfect and helpful to hear that it bounced back here first quarter. And then last one from me, just really a minor one the CVA I think you guys highlighted the counterpart evaluation adjustment in the processing fee, can you maybe size that for us? Mike Bell : It was approximately $3 million positive Brennan. Brennan Hawkins - UBS: Terrific and that\u2019s versus sequential or year-over-year? Mike Bell : Sequentially it\u2019s flat, it was also positive in Q4. Q1 doing some my memory I believe was minus $6 million. So it would be a $9 million improvement on comparing those two quarters. Brennan Hawkins - UBS: Terrific. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : I guess I am still confused by the slide on the asset servicing fees as a percentage of assets under custody, I think your asset value at the Investor Day, I get the context that less than 50% of the fees are directly linked to AUC, but I think you stopped sort of really providing a detailed explanation of the dynamics that will play there. So maybe you could do that for us now I mean I think we are seeing better flows at the asset managers portfolio turnovers finally picking up, so why is this still falling. What types of activity is specifically under pressure and all those cyclical \u2013 cycle of pressures? Mike Bell : Sure, Luke, it\u2019s Mike, the transaction revenue is the main piece that I would ask you to factor into your analysis. So specifically transaction revenue was down $5 million sequentially Q4 versus Q1. And it\u2019s just lower market activity. I mean believe me when I tell you, we have looked at it several different ways and it just looks like it is driven by lower market activity going on. And so I would expect when we get into an environment where the global economies were healthier and there is a little more risk taking. We would expect that to improve, but I would certainly acknowledge that we have seen it move in the opposite direction now for three sequential quarters and just in time for me taking the job of course. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, slightly more detailed question, maybe you could just touch on processing fees and other revenues. I think there was some noise in this quarter, but I think the last time you said anything in terms of guidance was first quarter 2012 and you pointed to $70 million to $75 million as a decent run rate, but then later you\u2019ve stated that line by about $35 million. So would you be willing to say that $100 to $210 million is a decent run rate for that line? Mike Bell : Luke what I would suggest is if you include the tax equivalent adjustment that we detail every quarter which the recent increase there has been primarily caused by the higher volume of tax-advantaged investments. If you include that tax equivalent adjustment, I would expect that the processing fees and others would range between $125 million and $135 million a quarter for the remainder of this year, again importantly including the tax equivalent adjustment. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then final one from me. Just high level, given that the scale asset managers have been earning sub-par for the last five years, I would imagine that smaller services are maybe even earning worse returns, so why haven\u2019t we seen more competitors accept the business will merge and maybe you can discuss the dynamics that caused I think so many to hang on this business and then what did that say about the benefit of having scale on the business? Jay Hooley : Luke, is your question pointed at asset managers or asset servicers? Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : I am sorry to say asset mangers, I mean asset servicers. Jay Hooley : Okay, it is a huge advantage of scale and I think they are getting even greater when you think about the position of regulatory and compliance cost that we referenced earlier. I think that the question of why you have done more consolidation on the back of that. First off there has been a lot of consolidation, so if you look at the concentration in the asset servicing business there are four firms that have 70% of the market by the industry calculations. You\u2019ve got a series of banks, European banks I think continue review this business even though sub scale is attractive and some parts because the liquidity is that provide an environment where those banks are under some pressure. So I think that move on its closure some point in the future but I don\u2019t see exchanging and short term. And other category of service providers I would point to if you look at the alternatives. As in servicing space its get a little bit more for us volume of sub scale players remains that many of you wouldn\u2019t know it and that\u2019s been I think that\u2019s a market that proportionally has higher growth prospects and has experienced higher growth. So, I think that\u2019s caused people to hang in there. So, in summary I would say there is, because of the concentration and consolidation that occurred up until now there is less prospects who are lapsed. And for different reasons people are finding it so interesting being in the game. I think that the need to drive efficiency out the core operations need to address components and regulatory costs will continue. And I think that puts pressure on sub scale providers. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets : Hi, guys, this is actually Steven Dong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking a call. Just going back to SOR you guys had provided some color on the improvements sequentially. Would you happen to have the break out of the percentage basis of the moving parts for that? Mike Bell : Steven, it\u2019s Mike. So what was focus on the bank which went from 5% to 6%. Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets : Yes. Mike Bell : And so specifically and going to give you round numbers here. The improvement that we got from the temporary credit on the intangibles is worth approximately half of that so call if 50 basis points. The combination of the moving to the daily average calculation rather than the month end calculation roughly offset the larger balance sheet we have in the quarter because of the spike up in the excess deposits. You can size that plus and minus that about 30 basis points but those \u2013 those two things of offset. And then the benefit that we got from the improve conversion factors under the rules, is worth approximately 30 basis points. And then we had a bunch of other odds and ends that contributed 20 basis points. So that would be the go forward at the banks from 5 to 6. Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets : Great, thank you. And we do have the holding company level at all? Mike Bell : Sure. It\u2019s approximately the same numbers, the only other piece that you are going to factor in to that analysis is that the proceeds that we have from the pref issuance. So the call it 750 million of proceeds from the pref issuance is worth call it another 25 to 35 basis points that\u2019s it quarter level and not at the bank level. Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets : Right. When you issue your $500,000 million in plus you would expect perhaps another say 15 basis points then? Mike Bell : That\u2019s correct, call it 20 yes. Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, perfect. And just going back to your new business wins, do you have the break out what was the outside of the U.S. versus U.S.? Jay Hooley : Yes. I think it was roughly 38% outside the US, which is consistent with downs we have seen over the last couple of quarters. Steven Dong - RBC Capital Markets : Great, that\u2019s all for us. Thanks for taking the call. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : A couple of questions one on expenses and one on revenues, so on the expense side I noticed you have the merit increase coming this year and I don\u2019t know if this right calculation we just look at relative to total comp dollars looks like around 2% hike and wondering how you think about sizing it. This feels a little bit higher than inflation right now. Looks like its not necessarily tight performance is that there is wondering how you size that number? Mike Bell : Yes, Betsy, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, we did average a 3% increase in base salaries that\u2019s effective in April. And basically, we did a review of the market conditions. We reviewed what other companies were doing, where our compensation levels were versus other key competitors and key competitors, not just banks, but also just other people that we battle with for talent. And yes, I would certainly acknowledge that the 3% is a fair amount higher than the last couple of years where we had very small increases. And but \u2013 again, we thought it was important given the competitive landscape and the importance of keeping our top talent. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So if we see a little wage pressure here maybe we will get interest rates rising on the front of the curve, so again that would be nice? Mike Bell : That will be very helpful, Betsy. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Exactly. So then just the second thing is on collateral transformation, I just wonder at the Analyst Day, Investor Day, you have highlighted some of the things you are doing to try to increase your share of activity along the trading channels right doing more in TV related stuff doing more with collateral management and collateral transformation. Could you give us a sense of where you are in that process? And is this anything that we are going to see in the numbers, in the next year or this is more of a very gradual over time five years down the road we will look back and say, hey, this was a story something to act? Jay Hooley : Betsy, this is Jay. Let me take that. I would say it\u2019s the latter. It will gradually bleed in over time. I think collateral transformation is a product that we offer today, where ramping up slowly that activity across the number of customers, derivative clearing probably a little bit more excitement going on. We are on the front end of timing of customers. There is a little bit of a lead time to sign them up. Once you sign them up, you should see a pretty steady flow. I think we are viewed as an attractive alternative on the derivatives clearing space. And then Enhanced Custody would be another product that I would say is maybe indicative of what I would expect that of derivatives clearing, collateral management a couple of years out. It took us a year or so to get it set get the infrastructure set, revenues started coming in, but once they start coming in, they should be pretty sustainable and improving over time. So it\u2019s the gradual enhancement to core revenues. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Hi, thanks a lot. Just a quick question on the assets under custody and administration levels, it looks like just looking at your Page 3 of the main release that it went up 0.2%, but the markets in most cases, I guess other than EEFA went up more than that and you guys do sight net new business. I am wondering just in terms of levels why wouldn\u2019t it go up a little bit more given your equity sensitivity? Jay Hooley : Yes, let me take that one, Cynthia, because there is a \u2013 we did lose a customer that had low revenues and high AUA and let me just explain the situation, because it\u2019s unusual with the customer that we acquired through IBT back in \u201806 it\u2019s rare that we would do middle office without custody activities. In this case, we were doing middle office without custody activities and it had a pretty high AUA and pretty low revenues. It was a pretty simple middle office construct. And in talking to the customer over the last couple of quarters, they concluded we agreed that they would internalize it and so that really speaks to that abnormality, which I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I would say was clearly one-off. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : So can you give a sense of the size of that and I guess there is very little revenue impact you are saying? Jay Hooley : Yes, $500 billion which is where you get the anomaly and pretty low revenue. Again, just a simple middle office only implementation, nowhere close to our, all of our other middle office implementations, but that\u2019s distortion. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay. And in terms of the new asset servicing mandates you are bringing in, how does the mix compare to what you have in place in previous quarters? Any shift, is it similar? Jay Hooley : Yes, it\u2019s similar, but it\u2019s heavily weighted in the alternative space, again more hedge and private equity. You also see \u2013 we all see those alternative structures moving down in market and to some of the liquid structures. So I would say we should continue to expect to see proportionately more of our new business growth coming in those alternative categories. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then finally the $40 million cost saves you guys have cited and the headcount cut, maybe you said this. But where are those cuts and are there any offsets like for instance the increase in IT as you move to external service providers. Is that related to headcount cuts? Jay Hooley : No, I would say Cynthia that the headcount cuts were kind of broad-based, no specific theme, but as we continue to mine the organization for efficiencies or things that we can do in other places we took advantage of that. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : And are there any offsets in terms of greater use of outside services? Jay Hooley : No, it\u2019s a straight reduction. Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America/ Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you. Jay Hooley : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wharton with JPMorgan. Steven Wharton - JPMorgan: Hi guys. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Steven Wharton - JPMorgan: I just wanted to I think this question may have been asked but forgive me if it was. What was \u2013 what\u2019s the business the whole outsourcing and IT initiative cost sales objective for 2014 incrementally and what has been achieved cumulatively to-date of the total that you\u2019re trying to achieve through the end of 2015? Mike Bell : Sure. So Steven its Mike. The goal for 2014 full year is $130 million and that would bring the cumulative to-date to $550 million at the end of this year and there would be a remaining approximately $50 million that we would get in 2015, so $600 in total. Steven Wharton - JPMorgan: Right. And were you saying that through the first quarter you\u2019ve already achieved the $130 million I was.. Mike Bell : I would characterize it is not the full amount but a majority of the amounts. If you then annualize the Q1 we would have achieved the majority of the annual amount. Steven Wharton - JPMorgan: Okay. So basically that\u2019s why on degree you\u2019ve announced this additional restructuring of sort because you basically run out of benefits from the outsourcing initiative for this year and then there has been maybe a little bit more in 2015? Mike Bell : Yes, I mean again we did for a variety of reasons including the software revenue picture. And the importance of our goal of achieving overall positive operating leverage for the full year. Steven Wharton - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: Hi Mike, hi Jay. I want to reconcile one comment you mentioned the transaction related fees were down $5 million or transaction related revenues were down $5 million linked quarter. But then when I look at your commentary in the release on transaction processing expenses, you say that those were up due to higher volumes. So how do I reconcile those two statements? Mike Bell : Sure. Vivek its Mike. They are even though they\u2019re both, they had the word transaction and then they are very different items. So specifically as I mentioned earlier the brokerage and other revenue is driven by the combination of the lower gold fees with SPDR GLD fees as well as the pressure that we\u2019ve seen on the electronic exchange revenue that\u2019s picked up in other trading services. The transaction processing fees those are mainly service bureau fees and they are higher based on our higher volumes that, those kinds of volumes would tend to track more with our global service fee revenue as opposed to any of the other line items. So. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: But the gold and other is showing up in processing and other fee, right? Mike Bell : Well the gold fee is driven by the volume of (indiscernible) that we. Sorry go ahead. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: Yes, the gold and other and the brokerage fees whereas I am referring to your asset servicing fees we\u2019ve talked about transaction related activity being down. And I am reconciling, trying to reconcile that with transaction volumes being up in the transaction processing expenses line? Mike Bell : I am sorry, I misunderstood your question Vivek. So again the transaction fees that we get as part of the GS revenue is down just because of lower market activity. Things like the service bureau fees that can include things like pricing, services, transfer agent cost. Again, there are different volume drivers from the expense versus the transaction revenue. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: Okay, alright. Let me reask one other question asked earlier. The processing and other fees which went up from 106 to 127 which you said the run rate will be 125 to 135. When I look at the (tax less) quarter adjustment that went from 53 to 57, so a lot bigger increase in the processing and other fees, what\u2019s driving that and how sustainable is that? Mike Bell : Sure. Again, I would suggest you look at in total because part of the processing and other fees. If you exclude the tax equivalent adjustment is actually the amortization that we have on the tax advantaged investments themselves. So that piece contributed three of number that you are describing. So I think of the tax advantaged investments as being up 7 sequentially which is poor from the tax equivalent adjustment and 3 from the lower amortization. In terms of the rest beyond the 7 of JV revenue was up sequentially 8 million Q4 versus Q1 of 2014. Again that tends to bounce around but I think the Q1 is pretty down close to what would expect further remainder of the year in term of JV fees but again with the caveat but it does bounce around. We also head on uptick in portfolio a transition services specifically some currency risk management fees that we saw in increase and again I would characterize the Q1 has being in reasonable expectation for the remainder of the year. In aggregate the back I would say that the processing fees and other including the tax equivalent adjustment or reasonable expectation would be 125 to 135 over the remainder of the year, with the, slight growth that we\u2019ll see there are mainly driven by higher tax advance investments for Q2 and Q3 in particular. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Hi, good morning. Just want to follow up on your NII outlook in the balance sheet you had a bigger spike in deposits in the balance sheet when you peers I guess number one can you may be if you have any insides on what drove the spike. And then secondly embedded in your NII outlook what is your view \u2013 what\u2019s the embedded view of your balance sheet for the rest of the year? Thanks. Mike Bell : Sure, Jim its Mike. I\u2019ll start the first we didn\u2019t see on increase in excess deposits in Q1 versus Q4 we estimate that they will up approximately 3 billion in terms of the average daily balances Q1 versus Q4. They spike significant at the very end of the quarter and view it as really a function of the fact that we viewed as a safe heaven and also that there are not other great alternatives for our clients to put very short-term money at this point in time. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Europe for the US or so. Mike Bell : It\u2019s actually both. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay. Mike Bell : Both so I again if you look at any particular plan there is a different story for each client but that in this \u2013 it is global\u2014phenomenon at this point. In terms of what we think size in the balance sheet would be the over the course of the year, the short answer is, if we expect, if the short-term interest rates do rise, we do expect of the majority of our excess deposits that are on the balance sheet would likely viewed and find other places where they get earn better yields. And that is embedded in our forecast that will gave under that scenario remember. Jim, I would ask you to remember that this is very low margin, this is because basically we take these client deposit fees, these excess deposits from our clients and put them with the big central bank. So again with earning for our numbers call it 20 basis point name on that \u2013 on those assets. So it\u2019s not a big move in terms of our net interest revenue over the course of the year. Excluding the impact of the excess deposits I would expect that we would have essentially stable to perhaps modest growth in the core operational deposits over the course of the Europe. The big mover in terms of the overall size of the balance sheet will be the \u2013 will likely be the excess deposits. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee - KBW: Thanks for taking my question. And yes, I apologize upfront for this, but it\u2019s \u2013 I want to go back to asset servicing and trying to get wrap my head around the idea of the lower activity, because when you look at a lot of things out in the marketplace, whether it\u2019s fund flows, whether it\u2019s move to alternatives, whether it\u2019s even, I guess I would characterize even higher sec lending balances as being some indication of leverage and risk taking? And then kind of also layer on top of it, but may be you are being impacted in asset servicing by lower customer activity? Couple of things, how much of that maybe is being impacted by pension movements for the LDI, was that having like negative impact on that business that\u2019s discernible and should we be thinking that maybe that business, maybe say to a point you made on emerging markets of actually maybe it\u2019s more leveraged to two emerging market flows and things like that, that maybe we would proceed from the outside? We are just trying to be a little more granular on it. Mike Bell : Well, Robert, let me start with a couple of facts and then I will ask Jay if he wants to add. So in terms of the transactional revenue that\u2019s embedded in our global service fees, those were down as I said earlier, down $5 million sequentially and down $3 million versus Q1 of 2013. We have sliced in and diced it. And it just truly looks like simply lower market activity and unfortunately has been a continued trend that we have seen now for three straight quarters. I think there is potential for that to improve when we see a little bit more global market activity, but again, those are the facts. Let me see if Jay wants to add? Jay Hooley : I don\u2019t know what I could add other than just it does reflect the portfolio managers who are part of the customer base that we serviced there, velocity of trading. And as you know, we proportionately we are greater in the funds business, in the alternatives business, less proportionately in pensions and corporates. So, it\u2019s \u2013 I can\u2019t put my finger on anything other just lack of trading volume. I think to me the service fees in addition to the actual trading activity being affected as much by kind of muted market activity, pretty slow growth on the equity and the fixed income front and lack of risky investments as much a drag on that service fee line as the transaction volume itself. Robert Lee - KBW: I appreciate taking my question. Thank you. Jay Hooley : Stephanie, is that it? Operator : Yes, that\u2019s your final question sir. Jay Hooley - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer : So thanks everybody. We look forward to getting on the phone with you again at the end of the second quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I would like to introduce Valerie Haertel, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street. Valerie Haertel : Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Our second quarter earnings materials include a slide presentation.

Any such forward looking statements speak only as of today, July 22, 2014. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward looking statements to reflect events or changes after today. Now, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Valerie and good morning everyone. Our strong second quarter results reflect growth in core servicing and management fee revenue driven by both, higher global equity markets and net new business. With respect to our market driven revenues, we experienced a typical seasonal uplift in securities lending, as well as increased demand in our enhanced custody program which has been a driver to growth over the past few quarters. Additionally foreign exchange trading performed well with higher volumes in both direct and indirect trading execution methods despite extremely low volatility for the industry. And IR [ph] also performed a bit better than we expected due to a higher level of interest earning assets from new business and higher client deposits. On the expense front, we continue to be focused on controlling expenses across the organization. While we continue to perform as we anticipate on operating expenses, we are experiencing increased pressure from regulatory compliance costs. Now I would like to provide a brief economical view on review of the second quarter global equity market performance for trading environment and how our revenues were impacted. The U.S. economy bounced back solidly during the second quarter following a very weak first quarter, lower employment, increased household wealth and improved credit conditions are combining with a still very accommodative monetary policy to support an improving outlook for the U.S. economic recovery. Global equity and fixed income market performance was strong during the second quarter. The S&P 500 daily average was up nearly 4%, the EAFE daily average was up 2.5%, and the Barclays U.S. aggregate index was up 2%. The Federal market committee\u2019s June policy statement affirmed that the economy was rebounding, and as such, an outset of Fed would continue tapering its asset purchases each month with a view towards ending them in the fourth quarter. We expect the Fed to leave administered interest rates unchanged at a very low level, direct of the year, and begin to gradually increase in the middle of next year. The Euro zone continues to lead U.S. recovery in the remaining weak and uneven, even as rise in political attentions and a potential re-intensification of the debt crisis continue to present downside risk. With growth persistently weak and unemployment still extremely high, inflation is uncomfortably low and is expected to remain low for a prolonged period. Against this backdrop, the ECB took action in early June to ease its monetary policy stance. As widely anticipated it reduced administered interest rates, including a cut to the deposit facility rate paid on excess reserves to below zero. We\u2019re closely monitoring market conditions including market interest rates which have generally remained positive, SWOT markets, and client deposit behavior. On the positive side, EU [ph] continues to be the global growth it will reaccelerate over the next few years as growth picks up in advanced economies and stabilizes in developing economies. With respect to the trading environment, State Street benefited from higher global equity markets. During the second quarter we saw an increase in investor risk appetite which was favorable to our asset mix. Clients increased allocations to both, emerging market and maturing market equities and reduced allocations to money market funds. As a result we saw a slight pickup in U.S. transaction volume, reversing a low transaction volume trend we saw over the last few quarters. Both dynamics were positive contributors to our servicing fee revenue. As reflected in this quarter\u2019s results, we continue to see strong and steady demand for our products and services globally. Our second quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $250 billion, representing a range of clients and sectors. 58% of those assets were from outside the U.S. which is an increase from prior quarters, perhaps signaling improved confidence in the global economic outlook, and a result of willingness of clients, particularly in Europe, to change service providers. Also included in our new business wins are 26 new alternative assets servicing mandates. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $243 billion and our current pipeline is strong. In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $18 billion for the second quarter which was the best quarter of flows since the third quarter of 2012. The flows were driven primarily by net inflows of $10 billion into ETFs, $12 billion into institutional mandates, and money market funds of $1 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $5 billion from short-term collateral pools. We intend to build on this new business momentum for the rest of the year. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. Mike Bell : Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. This morning, I\u2019ll start my review on slide 9. While we\u2019ve noted several financial highlights for the second quarter, and for the six months ended June 30 which I will refer to as year-to-date. Unless noted separately, we\u2019ll reference only the non-GAAP operating basis results in my comments today. By wins summary, second quarter results were improved in what remained a challenging operating environment. We plan to continue to focus on our top priorities, driving core revenue growth, investing in growth opportunities, controlling expenses and managing our strong capital position. Regarding the first half of 2014 EPS increased approximately 8% from the first six months of 2013. Year-to-date however revenue increased approximately 4% compared to the year ago period. Importantly, year-to-date core servicing and management fee revenue increased approximately 7% compared to the same period in 2013, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher equity markets, net new business, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. EPS for the second quarter 2014 increased to $1.39 per share from $0.99 from the first quarter of 2014, and from $1.24 in the second quarter of 2013. As a reminder, our first quarter 2014 results included the seasonal affect of $146 billion of deferred incentive compensation expense for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Second quarter results also reflect the seasonal increase in our securities finance business that typically occurs in the second quarter. Compared to the second quarter of 2013 the increase in EPS was primarily due to a strong increase in core servicing and management fees, a lower operating basis tax rate, and the impact of our share repurchase program. These positives were partially offset by lower market driven revenues and higher expenses. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, total expenses increased approximately 4% primarily due to the higher compensation and regulatory compliance costs, including the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Our second quarter 2014 pretax profit margin was 32%, down slightly from the second quarter of 2013. The operating basis effective tax rate was lower than normal this quarter due to some one-time items. We do expect a higher operating basis tax rate in the second half of the year. Turning to slide 12, I\u2019ll provide additional details of our operating basis revenue for the second quarter of 2014 primarily focusing on the notable variances to the second quarter of 2013. Second quarter 2014 servicing fees performed very well, up approximately 7% compared to the second quarter of 2013. The increase primarily reflects stronger global equity markets, net new business, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. Second quarter asset management fees increased 8% from the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to stronger global equity markets. Money market fee waivers were $10 million in the second quarter, flat with the first quarter and up from $8 million in the second quarter of last year. Trading services revenue increased modestly compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue as a result of higher volumes, partially offset by lower volatility. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, trading revenue was lower primarily due to lower FX volatility. Compared to the second quarter of 2013 securities finance revenue increased primarily due to new business and enhanced custody. Enhanced custody represented 25% of our second quarter securities finance revenue and more than 100% of the growth compared to the prior year quarter. Enhanced custody also benefited from the seasonal increase in our securities finance business. Processing fees and other revenue increased from the second quarter of 2013, including higher revenue associated with our tax-advantaged investments. Our net interest revenue decreased from the second quarter of 2013 primarily due to lower yields on interest earning assets, partially offset by lower interest expense and a higher level of interest earnings assets. Average interest earnings assets increased from the first quarter, primarily driven by a higher level of client deposits. In addition, year-to-date net interest revenue has benefited from higher short-term Euro market rates than we had expected. Offsetting these positive factors and placing pressure on net interest revenue are factors that include the sustained low interest rate environment, the recent reduction in Euro market interest rates, and our portfolio\u2019s reinvestment in the higher quality liquid assets to meet the new liquidity requirements. The many of you have had questions regarding the impact of the European Central Bank lowering the open deposit rate to negative 10 basis points and the related impact on our deposit pricing. While overnight rates have come down since the June 5 announcement which is placing pressure on our net interest revenue, market rate still remains slightly positive. We continue to evaluate our options and are monitoring the actions of other market participants. Based upon our current assessment of market conditions, we now expect full year 2014 operating basis net interest revenue to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion assuming the client deposits and market interest rates continue at second quarter levels through the remainder of the year. Now let\u2019s turn to operating basis expenses on slide 13. Our second quarter 2014 compensation and employee benefits expenses increased approximately 6% from the second quarter of 2013 due to new business support, higher incentive compensation, the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, annual merit increases, and higher regulatory compliance costs, partially offset by savings associated with the Business Ops and IT program. Information systems and communication expenses increased from second quarter 2013 due to higher infrastructure costs. Transaction processing expenses increased from the second quarter 2013 reflecting higher volumes and higher equity values in the investment servicing business. Occupancy expenses of $115 million increased compared to the year ago quarter. Occupancy expenses in the second quarter 2014 included a one-time recovery of $5 million. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, other expenses decreased 3% primarily due to a $9 million credit associated with Lehman Brothers-related recoveries in the second quarter of 2014, and lower legal and sales promotion expenses, partially offset by higher regulatory compliance expenses. Now I\u2019ll provide you with some details on our June 30, 2014 balance sheet. As you can see on slide 14, our overall approach to managing our investment portfolio has not changed and we have maintained a high credit quality profile. Our interest rate risk position was also in line with our position at last quarter. Additionally, the after-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of June 30, was $456 million, which improved from last quarter, primarily due to narrower spreads and a decline in longer term interest rates in the second quarter. And I will turn to the next slide to review your capital position. As you can see we maintained a strong capital position and that strength has allowed us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As we have previously announced, we completed our Basel III qualification period, our parallel run in the first quarter this year. As a result, beginning with this quarter, we are now calculating and disclosing our actual regulatory capital ratios under the advanced approach framework of the Basel III final rule. As of June 30, 2014 our Tier 1 common ratio under the Basel III advanced approach was 12.8%. Under the Basel III standardized approach, which will not go into effect until 2015, our estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 11.3%. We estimate that our pro forma Basel III supplemental leverage ratios under our interpretation of the U.S. proposed rules issued on April 8 are approximately 6.1% at the holding company and approximately 5.8% of the bank as of June 30, 2014. These leverage ratios about the holding company and the bank are down slightly from last quarter due primarily to an increase in average assets from higher client deposits. As we continue to focus on returning capital to our shareholders, during the second quarter of 2014 we purchased approximately 6.3 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $410 million, resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $435 million for the quarter. As of June 30, 2014, we had approximately $1.3 billion remaining on our current common stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock for March 31, 2015. Now before I wrap up my comments, I would like to review our current outlook for the remainder of 2014. For revenues, our results this quarter include the positive effect of the foreign dividend season which significantly benefited securities finance revenues. We expect both agency securities lending and enhanced custody revenue to revert to lower levels in the third quarter due to the end of the seasonal activity. In addition, from my earlier remarks, we expect net interest revenue in the second half of 2014 to be below the first half of the year due to current market conditions. Overall, for the full year 2014, we continue to target 3% to 5% revenue growth compared to full year 2013. I\u2019d now like to address a question which I suspect is on investors and analysts minds, which is the outlook for operating leverage. Due to expense pressure from regulatory compliance, it will be more challenging for us to achieve our goal or positive operating leverage for 2014 unless we experience an improvement in multi-driven revenues. Specifically, it\u2019s important to highlight that regulatory expectations for GSAB like State Street have continued to increase. Importantly, it\u2019s not just related to compliance with new rules, it\u2019s across all areas of the company, including list data aggregation and reporting, mismanagement and governance, recovery and resolution planning, client onbaording and transaction monitoring systems and documentation requirements. The amount of effort to fully comply with these expectations is higher than what we previously expected. As a result, we currently expect 2014 regulatory costs to be higher than our earlier expectations. In the meantime, we continue to focus on managing other elements of our expense base to offset some of the impact of the higher regulatory expenses, this includes continuing to execute on the severance program announced in first quarter. In aggregate, we currently estimate that our operating expenses for the third quarter of 2014 will be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter levels, primarily reflecting increased regulatory costs offset to some extent by other savings. We also currently expect fourth quarter expenses to be approximately in line with third quarter expenses. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Mike. And Stephanie we\u2019re now available to answer questions. So you might open the lines. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Great. Hey, good morning guys. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : So first question on expenses. I guess what\u2019s changed since the prior \u2013 I mean, what did you guys learn over the course of the quarter that led you to believe that expenses on regulation will exceed that kind of the $40 million number that you provided in the past? And then secondly, I guess more importantly the question I think a lot of investors will have is, once you get through this how should we think about these level of expenses heading into 2015; i.e., is this a catch-up bet for whatever reason that you guys didn\u2019t really anticipate in the past and not just a ramp that we\u2019re seeing this year. And then we\u2019ll see some easing into 2015 or how should we think I guess about expenses on regulation beyond this current period? Mike Bell : Alex, it\u2019s Mike, I\u2019ll start regarding your question around 2014. The main thing that is different from what we talked about say at the Investor Day \u2013 it\u2019s now clear to us that expectations, really across the board by all regulators are higher than what we had previously anticipated. And, just as a reminder, I mean \u2013 we are a global company obviously, and what we have found is that expectations across the globe are higher for GSABs [ph] than we had previously anticipated and it\u2019s really very important to us Alex that we maintain good relationships with our regulators, particularly with the Fed, and we think at this point, it\u2019s prudent to plan to spend more resources than we had originally budgeted here for 2014. I mean as it relates to 2015, I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a little early to try to comment on that. Obviously, as we get closer to the end of the year, we might have some additional updates, but at this point I don\u2019t see any indication that the expectations are going to wretched back, but again, I wouldn\u2019t try to comment on spending at this point. Jay Hooley : Alex, let me just add just a comment on the longer term outlook \u2013 call it 2015 or whatever. With regard to regulatory compliance expectations, be it capital, be it liquidity, be it any other number of things that we\u2019re focused on; we\u2019ve organized internally to make sure that we not only comply with but also get organized around aggregating data, sources internally so that we create something that\u2019s sustainable and overtime I would expect that the cost would ramp down. Now there is an effort to get things organized and effective but efficiency is also a friend of mine for instance we go through this process. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Understood, thanks for that. And my second question is just around the balance sheet. When I look at the balances, big \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the similar trend with the other trusted banks this quarter as well. I guess, how sticky [ph] do you think these are \u2013 I mean it looks like a lot of it actually came from \u2013 in the U.S. side, so maybe you can talk a little bit to the sources of this excess cash, it just kind of keeps coming in. And then if you guys given any thought to potentially reposition the balance sheet and buy in some securities with all those excess cash that\u2019s sitting on in with the Fed right now. Mike Bell : Sure. Alex, this is Mike, I will start. You\u2019re absolutely right that we did see a significant increase in client deposits in Q2 relative to Q1. Unfortunately, most of that is in really the category of excess deposit, so we estimate that there was approximately 50% increase in excess deposits from Q2 relative to Q1 on average for the quarter. And our policy is basically to take excess deposits and place them with the central bank. So at this point there hasn\u2019t been any change in our philosophy and we don\u2019t think it would be prudent to turnaround and invest those excess deposits and longer term securities at this point. But again, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re monitoring, it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very cognizant of \u2013 particularly as it relates to the new liquidity coverage ratio requirements which will be effective January 1, 2015. So, more information to come there. Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Understood, thanks so much. Mike Bell : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Hi, good morning everyone. Mike, can you elaborate a little bit more on the offsets against the higher compliance costs. First of all, just relative to that, up 30 to up 40, can you size what the new increased expectation is? And then, do you also have plans to \u2013 given that this isn\u2019t different versus original expectation, are there plans to offset those costs in either salaries, incentive compensation plans for management or other parts of the business? Mike Bell : Sure, Ken. First \u2013 let me talk first about the $20 million increase that we expect, Q3 relative to Q2, and then when we come back to the first part of your question. First, I\u2019d emphasize Ken that the $20 million is obviously a current estimate so it\u2019s subject to change, and it\u2019s subject to some one-offs, some of our expenses, either plus or minus can be lumpy. But with that caveat out of the way, I\u2019d point to several pluses and minuses in Q2 just along the lines of what you were alluding to. First of all, the \u2013 we did have $14 million of expense recoveries in Q2 that dampened our overall aggregate expenses in Q2 that we don\u2019t expect to recur in Q3, so that was $14 million. We also have an extra payroll day in both, in Q3 relative to Q2 and that end up \u2013 we had the same number of payroll days in Q4 and Q3. So \u2013 but it is an increment of approximately $5 million going from Q2 to Q3. Then the other pluses and minuses that I would highlight here, first, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect that regulatory compliance costs will be higher in Q3 than Q2. We also anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to have net new business over the course of Q3 that will likely require some expense to service that revenue. And then importantly, we\u2019ve got a couple of areas of offset, we\u2019ve got the savings Ken from the Q1 severance actions that we took, and again we expect a large amount of those savings to come in Q3. And then, we\u2019re also looking at some other savings opportunities along the lines of what you described, and that could include redeploying existing resources to the regulatory compliance areas so that it\u2019s not incremental expense, it\u2019s just a redeployment of existing resources, we\u2019re working hard at that. As you mentioned, the management incentive comp \u2013 unfortunately adjust automatically for the higher expenses so that that will represent some partial offset as well. So basically, that \u2013 those are the pluses and minuses that we\u2019re really focused on as it relates to Q3 and Q2. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019d expect Q4 to be in line approximately with Q3 as being our current outlook. On your question on the overall level of regulatory compliance expenses, we are in the process \u2013 kind of working through those detailed plans, and I don\u2019t know that it would be very meaningful to you to give you an updated number, I think it would denote [ph] false precision and since we are reviewing the opportunities to redeploy existing staff, the gross amount of spending would not be the amount that I would expect to fall to the bottom line. So I think the more meaningful number would be to focus on the plus 20 sequentially. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay. And Mike, my second question is with regards to LCR compliance, can you tell us where you are? You had earlier in the year mentioned considering making changes \u2013 potential changes to the way that the balance sheet is structured and your investments are \u2013 where you\u2019re investments are heading. So you can just talk to us about LCR compliance and any anticipated changes to that? Mike Bell : Yes. So Ken, first of all, at the end of Q2 we estimate that we would have been in compliance with the new requirements for LCR level one [ph] 2015, and that was the result of diverting more of our assets on our balance sheet to the level one high quality liquid assets that were required. Now I would anticipate that there will be a little more migration in the second half of the year to a higher level of level one\u2019s and so therefore there is a little bit more dampening of NIR coming in the second half of the year, but that was reflected in the NIR estimates that I gave you for the full year. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, I\u2019ve got it. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Hi, thanks. On the \u2013 obviously, you have the DVARB [ph] season driving the securities on loan balances higher and producing the seasonality in the quarter. Is there anything else in there that helps drive the revenue be it like better spreads, higher interest and hard to borrows, or anything like that? Mike Bell : Glenn, its Mike. A couple of other things helped us out here in Q2 that I would highlight. First of all, in terms of the core servicing fees, we benefited from a couple of things that Jay emphasized in his prepared remarks. First, we did see a sequential increase in transaction revenues of approximately $5 million, Q2 versus Q1. And so that was a welcome change from the decrease that we had seen in the prior quarter, and \u2013 again, there are several moving parts there but we think some of that reflects the fact that there was some index rebalancing that took place in second quarter which again led to our clients generating more transactions. So that helped us. And then the other one was the change in the mix of flows. We saw some additional risk on behavior in Q2 relative to Q1, specifically with some cyclical rotation, back into emerging markets which was a welcome change. And then beyond core servicing fees, as I said in my prepared remarks Glenn, the \u2013 we did benefit from short-term market rates being higher than we had anticipated for the first half of the year in Europe, unfortunately that abruptly changed here in the early June with the ECB action. So \u2013 but the bottom line is, we got some benefit from first half of the year in IR that we don\u2019t expect to repeat. And I would think of that as sequentially Q2 to Q3, us losing approximately $10 million of NIR with the change in the European conditions, those would be the ones that come to mind. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Okay, I appreciate that. I was trying to get towards that but this will be a bigger sequential drop than normally just because of the bigger sequential output. Jay Hooley : Let me pick that up \u2013 so, in securities lending, is that was your\u2026 Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Correct. Jay Hooley : Comments were focused. Let me just describe what the quarter looked like and then we can talk through the second quarter, third quarter transition. Spreads were less than a factor, the level of M&A has helped the specials within securities lending but the overwhelming biggest factor in \u2013 other than the seasonality of the dividend season was the enhanced custody which is kind of the alternative direct to hedge fund lending program that we invaded couple of years ago and continue to invest in, we\u2019re starting to globalize that, moving that to Europe and Asia, is our current plan. Mike referenced in his remarks, it was 25% of our revenue in the second quarter and most of the uptake. So I would expect that we would see the drop of second quarter and third quarter but enhanced custody is a factor in us \u2013 what I believe is gaining market share in the overall securities lending business. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: I appreciate the extra color Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: On the \u2013 I know we want to look at expenses in aggregate but can\u2019t particularly \u2013 you called out some stuff last quarter like the merit increases but we\u2019re looking at 6% year-on-year for the quarter, maybe something more like 8% or 9% for the first six months, honestly doesn\u2019t match up with what we\u2019ve seen on the revenue side but to your point, the fee businesses are growing, the assets are growing. Just \u2013 I guess, the question is, how do you balance all that because it speaks out to all of us when we rip in through the numbers and contributing to the lack of operating leverage? Mike Bell : Sure, Glenn. I mean you\u2019re absolutely right in terms of year-over-year \u2013 the items that you described certainly have had a impact. I mean specifically, if we look at Q2 2014 versus Q2 2013, in terms of comp and benefits, you know first and foremost, I would highlight the fact that we have had growth in the quarter fee business and therefore, we\u2019re in the service business that requires additional expense to service that higher revenue. And then the other items or the items that we\u2019ve talked about previously which is, we did have a merit increase, saw that kicked in April 1, up 3%. We did have higher deferred management comp this year versus what we had a year ago because the performance year that we had in full year 2013 was higher than the performance we had in full year 2012 which meant that the deferred comp awards that were granted earlier in 2014 were higher. And then as we talked about last quarter and also at the Investor Day, we\u2019ve had higher regulatory compliance expenses, some of that has manifested itself in higher staff clause, and also then in the other operating expenses around consulting expenses. And then, the final thing I would highlight Glenn would be the growth initiatives that we highlighted at the Investor Day, those continue to be key priorities for us. I\u2019d point to something like enhanced custody where \u2013 it was a good thing that we invested in enhanced custody last few years because that\u2019s been more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in securities finance revenues. And so, not every initiative will be a success like enhanced custody but the point is, it is important for us to invest in these growth initiatives, so we\u2019ve remained innovative in terms of the value added services. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Robert Lee \u2013 KBW: Thanks, good morning. Can you \u2013 maybe Jay give us a little bit more color on the asset servicing lends, I mean how should we be thinking of that \u2013 maybe from a potential revenue impact? When you look at that anyway kind of sizing it or more of color on kind of \u2013 begin more of than the mix than how flow through revenues? Jay Hooley : Yes, the $250 billion of which \u2013 we also said $243 I think was the number as yet to be installed. As the real mix got a little bit more of a non-U.S. tilt to it, it continues to be colored proportionally more on the alternative space and the traditional alternative hedge but also liquid off \u2013 we\u2019ve had a couple of nice wins that are factoring through the revenue line, things that we\u2019ve reported over the last several quarters. So I would characterize the quarter as a pretty strong quarter from a standpoint of new business committed. I\u2019d also characterize the outlook from a pipeline standpoint as a strong \u2013 and probably stronger than it\u2019s been in a while and a little bit more with an international spend to it. When you look at the translation into the service fee line model, I thought I was pleased with the second quarter service fee growth and it \u2013 you know, it factors in obviously the equity markets, the \u2013 pretty positive re-risking environment from the customer standpoint and this layering in of the new business. So, I think if anything tremblized a little more positive than we\u2019ve seen from the standpoint of the quarter\u2019s results and the outlook from the pipeline standpoint. Robert Lee \u2013 KBW: Okay, great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, just a little \u2013 maybe a little bit of modeling question. But the tax rate in the quarter was a little low and I apologize if you addressed this before, but \u2013 and I know the guidance is that all, kind of comeback I think in the second half of the year. Can you maybe talk about what simply drove the lower tax rate in the quarter? Mike Bell : Sure, Rob. There are two primary items that impacted the Q2 operating tax rate. The first is that we did have some favorable settlements related to prior year tax returns, so that helped us in the quarter. And then the other factor that helped us in the quarter is that the Q2 operating tax rate is impacted by the rules \u2013 the accounting rules that govern the quarterly timing of the recognition of our tax advantaged investments. And so the net impact of that was that the Q2 rate was lower than what we estimate for the full year average, but we expect the second half of the year operating tax rate to be higher than that full year average. So that was the cause of the temporary favorable in Q2. Robert Lee \u2013 KBW: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thanks, good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Just \u2013 maybe Jay, just to go back to the servicing line \u2013 and thanks Mike for outlining the transaction impact. Can you also outline that the U.S. or the impact from these U.S. dollar weakening \u2013 and then Jay, if you can talk about to what degree are you seeing the next shift of new business, so \u2013 into alternative, helping that core fee ratio. Should we be thinking about that as an improvement in the core fee rate going forward, given you\u2019re seeing more assets in that area [ph]? Jay Hooley : Yes, I\u2019ll start and then Mike can pick up to currency effect. I think \u2013 to your question Brian, I think the bigger factor in the quarter with regard to the nice uptick and service fees was probably the asset mix, the re-risking from a client standpoint. I would say that the new business layering in, it\u2019s hard to characterize any meaningful difference. I think alternatives have been a theme for several quarters and as I spend time in the marketplace, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that there is a converges going on between the traditional loan only managers that are getting into all, liquid all, and the alternate managers going downstream until the traditional distribution channels. So, I would say if there was a sweet spot, prospectively that would be the sweet spot. It\u2019s alternative is moving into the traditional, the traditional moving into liquids, more of a U.S. and Europe phenomenon but growing in Asia as well. And if you believe that story, I would think that we\u2019re well positioned for that given the work we\u2019ve done on alternatives and given the penetration we have in the traditional asset management space where the liquid also being generated. Mike Bell : And so Brain, it\u2019s Mike. Regarding your factual question on the FX impact on GS revenue, we estimate Brain that on a year-over-year basis, so Q2 2014 versus Q2 2013, it helped us by about a percentage point, so specifically about $11 million of benefit in that year-over-year comparison on $1.2 billion of revenue. And then the sequential quarter was much smaller, it was approximately $3 million benefit in the Q2 versus Q1 comparison for GS revenue. Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And listening both of your comments it sounds like we have some sustainability but basically \u2013 principally on the re-risking more than anything \u2013 Jay Hooley : That\u2019s \u2013 I mean that your business commitment, pipeline, and re-risking are the three real pluses in my mind in the quarter. Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes, great, thanks for that. And then, just my follow-up question would be, you were talking about sort of the market environment for generating positive operating leverage in the second half. If you can mainly characterize what type of market environment do you think you would need to do that? Mike Bell : Sure, Brain. So \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s been a challenging first half of the year, on the other hand we continue to believe that our full year expectation is for revenue growth of 3% to 5% and as I said, the first half of the year it\u2019s been 4% on a year-to-date basis but we benefited by about a point from the weaker U.S. dollar on a year-to-date basis, we\u2019ll call it 3% on a constant currency basis. And then the mix has not been particularly helpful regarding operating leverage, the core revenues, the core servicing fees and management fees are up approximately 7% versus a year ago but the market driven revenues where we have the highest profit margins have actually been down year-over-year. So that mix has put pressure on us in addition to the fact that we have been at the lower end of that 3% to 5% range on a constant currency basis. And then on top of that as I said in my prepared remarks, the operating expenses, we\u2019ve got some additional pressure there because of the regulatory expectations. So the bottom line Brain is, we would need to see a year-over-year increase in the market driven revenues and in particular, the \u2013 some rebound in FX volatility and some help from our market interest rates in all likelihood to be able to achieve that result. Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. So if we just assume your current NIR forecast for example, maybe isolating that, is it fair to say that we would need to see an improvement in FX volatility to some extent and then a continued improvement in the equity market levels and continued pace of re-risking, and that\u2019s what you would describe as a positive environment? Mike Bell : Yes, I think it\u2019s there [ph]. Brian Bedell \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : I think last quarter you pointed a processing fees of $125 million to $135 million per quarter, and then you were below that this quarter and it looks like you also restated the first quarter result. So, maybe if you could review the moving parts with the taxable equivalent adjustment and update us on your expectations there? Mike Bell : Okay, sure Luke. So, first of all we did have a product reclass, specifically we provide a currency management service to our transition management clients and that revenue of $13 million in the quarter was reclassed out of processing in other and into the trading services line item. So if you added back that $13 million, then we initiate [ph] the processing fees in other would have been rate in line with what we had talked about previously. So it was that product reclass, it just moves revenue from one bucket to other that caused the lower reported number in the processing fees and other line. In terms of your question on the outwork for processing fees and other, we do expect that the second half of the year will have a higher tax equivalent adjustment, particularly driven by a higher volume of tax investments than what we had in the first half of the year. So including the higher tax equivalent adjustment in the second half of the year I would anticipate that processing fees and other would be in a range of \u2013 call it 1.15 to 1.20 for the third quarter, again that\u2019s subject to change, obviously with different one-offs, but that would that kind of range that I\u2019m currently thinking at this point. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, very helpful. And then, I wondered if you could comment on the proposal around brokerage commission sharing agreements which the regulators are calling inducements, how do you anticipate that might affect your European operations, either in your capacity to broke or \u2013 or in the investment management side of the business? Jay Hooley : Well Luke, this is Jay, I\u2019m not sure I can answer that one. I\u2019m roughly familiar with reclaim [ph] and it shouldn\u2019t have a big effect on any brokerage because that\u2019s something we don\u2019t do directly, probably I\u2019ll have to come back to you on that. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, fair enough. And then, I just wanted to circle back on the regulatory spending commentary. I mean, it seems like you began communicating this pressure a little bit later than other trust banks and so many assets managers, at least one of them is that peak spending now. So, I don\u2019t mean to just not comparative but a skeptic maybe could be a little bit later at the timing here given that you were the only one of your peers last year that posted material operating leverage and beat expectations. So maybe you could just comment on why there seems to be a delayed effect in your case and why you relied on recognizing the need to increase that spending? Jay Hooley : I can\u2019t speak Luke to other folk\u2019s representations. It\u2019s pretty clear to me that regulatory expectations are moving targets. I think that whether it\u2019s capital, liquidity, different levels of reporting that are required; the bar gets raised all the time. And so, I think for somebody today to say that the regulatory expenses has topped out or peaked, that sees inconsistent to me with what I\u2019m hearing from regulators. So, I think from our standpoint we are addressing the requirements and trying to do it in a way that\u2019s durable and sustainable and looks at building internal data models so that we can aggregate information more easily and fluently going forward. So we\u2019re trying to put in place an infrastructure that can continue to respond to what I believe will be an ongoing and increasingly challenging level of regulatory requirements. So, for us we\u2019ve been focused on this all along, and we\u2019re continuing to focus on it. I can\u2019t speak to what others point of view is on this. Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good morning. Mike, going back to the LCR, are you able to size what the revenue drag was this year? And just for a context, where were you at the beginning of the year and in terms of being comply for 2015, do you mean 80% or higher? Mike Bell : Okay, so actually several questions there. First of all I do anticipate that we\u2019ll be well higher, well north of 80% at year end. And again, we estimate that we\u2019re north of 80% here at Q2. So \u2013 again, our expectation is not to be close to that 80% minimum line but instead to really demonstrate that we have ample liquidity, relative to the Fed expectations in particular. And in terms of sizing it \u2013 surround numbers by the time we get to the end of the year, I would anticipate that the higher level of high quality liquid assets represents a drag of approximately $10 million a quarter for Q4 2014 relative to what we might have been pro forma without that higher level of Level One high quality liquid assets. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Got it. So when we think about 2015 we should think about \u2013 maybe drag possibly half that size going forward or is that too aggressive? Mike Bell : Serrao [ph], I think that\u2019s in the ballpark. I mean, again it\u2019s really early for us to be giving guidance around 2015 but I think you\u2019re sizing it approximately right, to the nearest half it would be about a half. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And then I had just a follow-up question on funding this quarter. The rate on other short-term borrowings was negative, any color there? This is supposed to reverse going forward? Mike Bell : Sure. Ashley, the \u2013 what that really reflects is an accounting reclass, basically this relates to a block of newly assets and a product that we use for tax free money market funds. So specifically we hit an accounting reclass that pointed now the interest rate swap to the asset side of the balance sheet rather than the liability side as indicated on the average rates page. So specifically, if you looked up at that state in political sub divisions, line item, you can see that that went down for the quarter and that\u2019s the accounting reclass where the impact of two quarters were \u2013 of this interest rate swap got reflected in Q2 in that line item. So I would expect in all other things equal that Q3 to jump higher than the 3.3%, something closer to call it the high three\u2019s in Q3 as the accounting reclass \u2013 disproportionate impact in Q2 gets changed. And that had been an equal offset to the other short-term borrowing rate. So I would anticipate the other short-term borrowing rate in Q3 to be something just north of zero, it would be sort of the average 1.57% in Q1 and a negative 1.2% in Q2, it would be something \u2013 about a small positive in Q3. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Alright, thanks for the color there. And just \u2013 moving onto sec lending and enhanced custody offering, it seems to be gaining a lot of fraction. I was just curious who is your incremental customer there today, is it just \u2013 are they switching just from the AGC program that you have? And how do you envision your competitors responding to this because this is pretty impressive growth that you\u2019re putting on? Jay Hooley : Yes, Ashley, let me take that. So I think we all know how this works. The \u2013 as opposed to lending securities to a prime broker who might lend them on to a hedge fund, we\u2019re lending securities directly to the hedge fund on a book entry basis so there is less folks in the chain, more efficient process, attractive from a hedge fund standpoint. So most of the activity would be bypassing the client broker I think is probably a fair way to look at it, and interestingly, I think many of the prime brokers out there are evaluating with the backdrop of the new capital requirements, how much and what type of prime broking they are looking to do. So it seems like we\u2019ve hit the market at a good juncture. Competitively, we were way out ahead of this, we were working on this for three or four years, and the last couple of years it\u2019s really started to hit its stride. So, the traditional competitors are focused on it but quite a way is behind. I also might add that our deep penetration in the alternative servicing marketplace positions us ideally for this because we\u2019re dealing with those kind of prioritize [ph] hedge funds, and even the liquid \u2013 place or the low leverage 1.30 funds are also used as of this enhanced custody. So that\u2019s gives you a little color on how it came to be and what the competitive landscape looks like. Ashley Serrao \u2013 Credit Suisse : Alright, great. Thanks for all the color, and thanks for taking my questions. Jay Hooley : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CAS [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, I have two questions, one easier and one, I think harder. But the easier question is, why did the balance sheet grow as much as it did, up $20 billion? And the difference between period end assets $280 billion versus average assets $235 billion, I mean those are big numbers, so is that risk-off? Is that a bunch of client wins or some other change, and do you think those funds will be sticky? Mike Bell : Mike, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, as we noted in our prepared remarks, the vast bulk of that balance sheet growth, Q2 versus Q1 was in fact an increase in excess deposit, so we estimated that the excess deposits were up, approximately 50% or $14 billion Q2 versus Q1, and that\u2019s on average for the quarter. On your question on the spike at the very end of the quarter, again, we have seen that, the Trust banks have seen that pretty consistently, really over the last year where as funds are looking for a Safe Haven at the quarter end reporting date, we\u2019ve been treated as that Safe Haven. I don\u2019t anticipate that the spike that we saw at June 30 is a [indiscernible] of things to come here in Q3. I would note that the vast bulk of those excess deposits left at the beginning of July just as we\u2019ve seen in prior quarter ends, and in terms of the excess deposits that we have, even on average for the quarter \u2013 we would anticipate that the majority of those excess deposits would likely move to a different place as short-term interest rates go up. Obviously we haven\u2019t tested that hypothesis yet because short-term interest rates have been particularly sticky and particularly well. Unidentified Analyst : And then my other question relates to \u2013 how much is the negative operating leverage for 2014, a statement on statutory [ph] versus the environment? It\u2019s been 3.5 years since you had the IT and Ops program and 3.5 years later we\u2019re hearing negative operating leverage. In your defense that I\u2019ve heard you say is, look interest rates are lower if longer that hurts NII, the regulatory environment is tough for that hurts the expenses. On the other hand, I note that headcount is kind of flat year-over-year, at least in the first quarter at 29,500, and I\u2019m just wondering how much you have left of $575 million to $625 million of savings? Mike Bell : Mike, on that last question, we do anticipate the \u2013 getting the stub expense saves of $50 million in 2015 as we fully capture the rest of the run rate from IT and Ops translation. The other headwind that you didn\u2019t mention that I would add has been FX volatility, I mean FX volatility is at historic lows, that has certainly been fund helpful to us in terms of ability to generate favorable operating leverage because as we talked about the Investor Day, since market driven revenues like FX and like NIR are our highest margin revenues and it\u2019s tough to generate positive operating leverage in that current environment. Unidentified Analyst : So how much have you actually achieved of the IT and Ops of the $575 million? Mike Bell : In terms of the run rate, we\u2019ve achieved on a run rate basis for the savings that we anticipated for 2014. So I \u2013 we\u2019ll obviously capture the saves in Q3 and Q4 but they are already in the Q2 run rate. So again, we anticipate the stub of $50 million in 2015 but at this point we\u2019ve achieved a run rate savings for 2014. Jay Hooley : And Mike, I would just try to raise this up a level. The \u2013 you know, we\u2019ve had some success with operating leverage. We\u2019ve got a little bit of expense headwind that we talked about with regard to regulatory but if you look at \u2013 I\u2019d say a real positive as the service fee, management fee, and if you look at the sustained \u2013 that kind of recurring headwind, it\u2019s really the net interest revenue. I mean, if you look at the impact that has had on a Trust bank, as for us the percentage of revenue and the fact that that\u2019s been grinding down over the last couple of years. We really need a turn in that, volatility would help and then I look at the health of the core service fee line, and that makes me feel pretty good. So I think in that grinding down interest rate environment, we\u2019ve been as you\u2019ve pointed out, becoming more efficient, that doesn\u2019t go away, that\u2019s embedded into who we are. Little bit of help on the rate side and the volatility side would turn operating leverage pretty quick, we\u2019re trying to get there without that. Unidentified Analyst : And then last follow-up, just \u2013 the headcount, it was 29,530 in the first quarter, what was it this quarter or if you don\u2019t have the exact number, how are you thinking about headcount because with all the initiatives that you\u2019ve undertaken it\u2019s hasn\u2019t really gone down. Mike Bell : Mike, I don\u2019t have that headcount number rate at my finger tips but I think importantly, one of the things that we\u2019re looking at carefully is around the headcount for regulatory compliance costs, relative to that trade-off with outside consultant. So we\u2019re really trying to manage the overall velars [ph] as opposed to artificially trying to push the headcount number down which would likely show up as higher consulting expense. Jay Hooley : The other thing I would say which I don\u2019t think we look for but I look at intensely internally is where that headcount is located, and it\u2019s been a steady migration of that headcount from higher cost locations to lower costs locations. So while the FTEs maybe the same, the cost per FTE is continuing to go down on a conscious basis. Unidentified Analyst : And they keep one regulation, maybe that\u2019s the different stroke \u2013 and more in regulation and less elsewhere, maybe that\u2019s being masked? Mike Bell : Yes, Mike, again I wouldn\u2019t try to give you a specific number at this point because again, I mean, we\u2019re \u2013 in effect virtually all of us are spending more time on regulations that are trying to do a precise analysis of the FTEs related to regulatory compliance, other than saying it certainly is up, I would not try to quantify that number, I think it be past precision. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffery [ph] with Autonomous Research. Unidentified Analyst : Hello. When you think about the Feds stuff in next year, how do you think the mechanism of tightening, whether it\u2019s raising interest of reserves, reverse repo rates, doing something else is going to impact customer behavior than NCL, balance sheet [ph]. Do you think it matters what option they go for? Mike Bell : Sure, Jeffery, it\u2019s Mike. First, we do expect that we may see some Fed tightening next year which ideally would lead to higher short-term interest rates, that certainly has the potential to help out our net interest revenue for next year. In that kind of situation as I said earlier, we do anticipate that perhaps a large chunk of the excess deposits that we had on our balance sheet at Q2 would migrate off the balance sheet and find a different home. And while there would be a small negative impact from that in IR, I would remind you that we\u2019re only earning approximately 20 basis points of net interest margin on those access deposits, so that impact I would expect to be manageable and probably more than offset by the favorable impact of an increase in short-term market interest rates. And of course, longer term Jeffery, that\u2019s also helpful \u2013 some shrinkage in the excess deposit is also helpful in terms of managing our capital ratio. So again, net-net I would view that as a positive impact if that happens in 2015. Jay Hooley : I think there \u2013 it\u2019s an insightful question because you\u2019ve heard from the Fed \u2013 I think they signaled pretty clearly that it could be different this time around with regards to using other tools other than just rate tightening, paying more in excess deposits, using repo. I mean, I think Mike\u2019s right which is \u2013 as rates go up, funds will find better uses for their excess deposits than State Street. On the other hand there is a point at which if the Fed increases the rate that they pay in excess deposits, it will depend on where overall rates are, that could be a real positive for us if given the excess deposits we\u2019re holding if the rates go up on that. Unidentified Analyst : And then how does those deposits are actually seeing impact on LCR, is there any impact or is it just a wash because you lose the high liquid assets or those deposits are assumed to go out anyway under the LCR calculation? Mike Bell : Yes, we would expect that to be a wash Jeffery because as you said, the excess deposits are assumed to run-off at 100% in the calculation. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America. Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America : Hi, thanks a lot. You mentioned some costs associated with installing net new business in 3Q and I\u2019m just wondering is that more than normal and why you would call that out. And I guess bigger picture question is, do some types of wins like alternatives require more upfront costs than others, and what is your mix shift mean for your upfront costs of installation? Jay Hooley : I think to the first question Cynthia, we always call it out, I think the nature of \u2013 I think what Mike was getting at is the nature of, when the revenue is driven by service fees it comes with certain amount of cost, generally implemented at business but supported on an online basis. With regard to the amount of upfront cost, it really is probably less relevant to \u2013 whether it\u2019s a traditional alternative or a pension fund and more related to the size, sophistication, or the implementation itself \u2013 I would say in a more simplified traditional implementation is called a quarter \u2013 a two quarter which is probably 70% of the new business. This tends not to be an extraordinary upfront \u2013 there is some lead expense. In that 30% where you have large sophisticated multi-jurisdictional implementations, DFA comes to mind, most recently \u2013 there is a little bit more upfront cost which would precede the implementation. Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America : Okay, great. And then, more big picture question on regulatory costs. I think \u2013 way back when you guys used to talk about regulatory pressures as also a business opportunity because you\u2019re clients are seeing it too, and it seems like the commentary has really shifted too. You guys are getting hit by a lot of regulatory costs but we\u2019re not hearing so much about whether you\u2019re still seeing it as a business opportunity for your clients. I mean just wondering, are you still seeing it as an opportunity or is it the type of regulatory costs that are just really different lawyers [ph] etcetera from the type of services you provide. Do you still see that as an opportunity? Jay Hooley : Yes, absolutely Cynthia. And in fact, I would summarize that the banks are ahead of the investment managers in the pension funds with regard to what I call a regulatory tsunami that\u2019s coming. But when you look at our investor services business that have requirements for risk management, for compliance, for reporting, for data aggregation, it is extreme. We organize in the last year a new set of activities under what we call global exchange which is designed to focus on that opportunity and it\u2019s been very active. Customers in the investment management and the asset owner segment are really struggling with their ability to get their arms around that data that feed compliance regulatory risk management system. So, I would say the opportunity is ever present and it\u2019s probably bigger prospectively because of this lag effect of banks that are being first through the pipe here. Cynthia Mayer \u2013 Bank of America : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Hey, good morning. I\u2019m just going to dive a little bit more into the custody fees. I think the sequential improvement was \u2013 or is the biggest we\u2019ve seen since the end of 2012, you highlighted the increased activity levels being about $5 million but the rest seemed to be from new business wins in market. Can you give us a little bit more \u2013 I think here you\u2019ve highlighted emerging markets as a big driver on the downside in the fee rate, it seems like we\u2019ve got a little bump on the fee rate this quarter. Is that the biggest delta X \u2013 the pickup in volumes or what else is driving that big sequential jump? And, I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how we think about momentum into the third quarter. Mike Bell : Sure, it\u2019s Mike. First, yes, the single biggest help in that ratio of fees to assets as you correctly concluded was the mix shift change into emerging markets that was particularly helpful to us in the quarter. Now \u2013 again, I would emphasize just as we have in prior quarters that we do think that ratio of fees to assets is relatively imprecise nature but to answer your question factually, yes, that mix shift plus the $5 million sequential improvement in transaction fees was the \u2013 what I would particularly highlight there. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the deposit side, I mean, I appreciate your comments that most of the deposits is a runoff. But I think we\u2019ve said that for four quarters in a row and the average balance sheet is growing every quarter. So have you guys \u2013 is there any insight on what\u2019s driving this dramatic \u2013 sort of quarter-over-quarter growth that we\u2019ve seen over the last four quarters. And, what\u2019s your conviction level that it does run off and stay off because it seems like we\u2019re always continuing to raise our balance sheet expectations going forward? Mike Bell : First of all, Jim, we are yet to see a period where market interest rates have increased, so we have to test the hypothesis that what happens to these excess deposits if short-term rates rise. We do have conviction that those deposits will likely find it more economic to find a different home in that environment but until we test that hypothesis with some real data, there is not much else we can do to prove it to you. And as a result, the Trust banks continue to be Safe Havens at quarter-end for a number of our clients. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Right, fair enough. And are you assuming \u2013 did you disclose that your assumptions are for the remainder of year on your balance sheet side in terms of your NIR forecast? Mike Bell : Yes, it assumes that the range that I provided in the prepared remarks assumes a flat level with average Q2 levels. Now, again \u2013 there is going to be variance around that, I don\u2019t know whether it will end up being plus or minus but given that we only earn approximately 20 basis points of net interest margins on those excess deposits, I don\u2019t think that will be a significant overall factor NIR for the full year. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Right, okay. Thanks a lot. Mike Bell : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawkins with UBS. Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS: Good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS: Just a quick question on the planned preferred equity capital raise that you guys have mentioned in the past, any change to your thinking around that or any clarity on timing? Mike Bell : Sure, no \u2013 the short answer is, no change in our thinking around the prefs. We do believe that ultimately we will issue at least another $500 million of prefs in order to optimize the ratios under the Basel III risk based capital ratios. So \u2013 and in terms of the timing, we\u2019ll continue to look at market conditions and a number of other factors, at this point I wouldn\u2019t have anything else to communicate on when the timing of that ultimate $500 million. Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS: Okay. And then a quick one, I know we\u2019ve sort of beaten the hell out of this dead horse but I want to give it another shot. I hear you that the environments been rough and it doesn\u2019t exactly bode well as far as the operating leverage, but we\u2019ve been saying that for a while and continuing to wait for the revenue environment to get better can probably feel like we\u2019re waiting for gondola [ph] here. So, what \u2013 do you all have something in mind where there is some sort of line to cross that would get you more aggressive to think about another cost cutting program? How much \u2013 how can we think about how much flexibility do you have in your expense base? I mean, from the color I would think you really don\u2019t have any but sometimes you find when push comes to the show that there is greater flexibility than you had previously thought off. Is there any way that you can help us think about that? Jay Hooley : Brennan, let me give it a shot. The \u2013 we\u2019re trying to strike the right balance between investing and in spite of all this pressure that we have, we are investing. If you look at IT as just a proxy for that it\u2019s been pretty consistent throughout that and we think that this period will at some point change and rates will go up and volatility would change. In the meantime, we\u2019re trying to scrape along and extract some operating leverage plus still spending for the long-term. And, so there is always expense leverage but we\u2019re trying not to take away from the future. So we\u2019re trying to manage expenses to create operating leverage which is our goal for this year. And \u2013 that\u2019s how I respond to that. Brennan Hawkins \u2013 UBS: Okay, thanks. Jay Hooley : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: You guys reported that the pretax operating margin improved in the quarter, I think you said to 32%. On the new business, how long does it take for \u2013 your new business wins to reach that type of operating margin? Jay Hooley : It depends, Gerard \u2013 I\u2019d go back to my earlier reference to \u2013 let\u2019s say two-third\u2019s, three quarters of the business is more routine, somebody brings up a new fund, we convert a small mid-size pension fund for 30 to 90 days. It doesn\u2019t take long in most cases for us to achieve profitability \u2013 target profitability, you have some preparation at a time but it doesn\u2019t take quarters to get to profitability. In the case of the larger and more complex, that might let out a little bit just because of the implementation cost and getting things settled in. So that will be my response. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Okay. Mike, regarding the LCR, in the proposal there is some changes that apparently are coming to the calculation of the LCR. Have you guys seen or heard of any of those changes, and would they benefit you and that your LCR ratio would actually be greater than where you think it is now if those changes actually come to past? Mike Bell : Yes, Gerard, it\u2019s like \u2013 we\u2019re obviously monitoring that situation very carefully. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate that having a major impact on the comments that I made earlier in terms of the impact but I don\u2019t want to try to speculate anymore than that until we see what the final roles are. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Okay. And then lastly, Mike, you talked in your prepared remarks about obviously what the ECD did with the interest rates overnight \u2013 overnight rate going to a negative number and you\u2019re exploring different options now or considering different options, as well as monitoring the competitors. What are some of the options that you guys are considering if that actually becomes more negative or just stays this way for an extended period of time? Jay Hooley : Gerard, this is Jay. If market rate actually went negative we could charge for deposits and that\u2019s not unprecedented, we\u2019ve done that in two European markets over the course of last couple of years. And \u2013 that\u2019s one option we could \u2013 we minimally have conversation with customers that are leaving deposits and explain that the economic predicament and help them determine whether they want to continue to leave deposits with a cost or find some other economic option to that. But it\u2019s not unprecedented, we did it in Switzerland and one other market, in Denmark, over the last couple of years, actually charged for deposits. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC: Great, I appreciate the insights. Thank you. Operator : At this time there are no additional questions. I\u2019ll turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Stephanie. And we would just thank you for your participation today and look forward to talking to you at the end of the third quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

(Operator Instructions). Now, I would like to introduce Anthony Ostler, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations of State Street. Anthony Ostler : Thank you very much, Stephanie. Good morning everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me on the call is Jay Hooley, Chairman, President and CEO and Mike Bell our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to discussing our agenda, I'd like to take this opportunity to invite our institutional investors and the analysts to join us for our 2015 Annual Investor and Analyst Forum in New York City on Wednesday February 25. We have chosen this date as it is our confirmed understanding that one of our larger peers will be holding their Investor Day, a day before on Tuesday February 24th in New York City. We look forward to seeing there, if not before. Now to our agenda. Jay will discuss the third quarter highlights and Mike will discuss financial results. Our third quarter earnings materials include a slide presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all the financial information discussed on today\u2019s webcast will reflect our operating basis results. Please note that the operating basis results are a non-GAAP presentation and this webcast includes other non-GAAP financial information. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures, including operating basis results to GAAP basis measures referenced on this webcast, and other related materials, such as the slide presentation referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. Mike Bell, will refer to the financial highlights presentation when he provides an overview of our financial results for the third quarter of 2014 which he will refer to as 3Q, \u201814 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 which he will also refer to as year-to-date 2014. Unless noted separately, Mike will reference only the non-GAAP operating basis results in his comments today. When reviewing our results to comparisons to prior periods, Mike will primarily focus on comparing our 3Q, \u201814 and year-to-date 2014 performance relative to our third quarter 2013 and nine months year-to-date 2013 performance; unless he otherwise notes that the comparison is sequential from our second quarter 2014 results. Before Jay and Mike begin this discussion of our financial performance, I\u2019d like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in State Street\u2019s 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. We encourage you to review those filings, including the sections on risk factors, concerning any forward-looking statements we make today. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of today, October 24, 2014. The corporation does not undertake to revise such forward-looking statements to reflect events or changes after today. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman, President and CEO, Jay Hooley. Jay Hooley : Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I\u2019d like to take a moment to welcome to State Street our new Head of IR, Anthony Ostler. Anthony recently joined us and has over 22 years of financial services experience. Now to my remarks, our third quarter results demonstrated good core fee growth in asset servicing and asset management, which together were up 9% from the third quarter of 2013, reflecting improved equity markets and new business commitments. Our market driven revenues also performed well in a traditionally seasonally slow quarter. Our pipelines are strong as evidenced by winning new business of $302 billion of assets to be serviced and we had $2 billion of net new assets to be managed this quarter. On the expense front, we continue to be very focused on controlling cost across our organization. As we have highlighted for you on the past couple of conference calls, we continue to experience increased pressure from regulatory compliance costs and would expect this pressure to continue in future periods. Despite the current challenges we faced some low interest rates, we have leveraged our strong market positions and capabilities to generate profitable top-line growth. Now, I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments, and how our business was affected. For the third year in a row, the third quarter has seen economists downgrade their forecast for global growth for the current and coming year. While not uncommon, this quarter's adjustment has had a number of important consequences. Global commodity prices have fallen. This has put further downward pressure on already falling global inflation rates and what has been a very uneven global recovery, this means that deflation has returned as a clear and present danger in a number of economies, especially in the Euro zone. This has already created a good deal of policy uncertainty. The ECB cut its administrated rates on September 4th in response to mounting pressure to further address the region\u2019s weak growth and loan inflation. Additionally, the ECB also began injecting liquidity into the system putting further downward pressure on market rates. In light of the EBC's decision to reduce deposit and administered rates, we have notified our clients of the potential to charge negative rates or fees on euro deposits. Our plan which is similar to many other banks is to begin charging later this quarter. In contrast, the response of the Fed to the global slowdown is less clear. Most still project the Fed tightening next year but the timing and scale of rate rises is now a key point of uncertainty. Nevertheless on balance, monetary policy in the U.S. and perhaps the UK will likely diverge in 2015 from the continued easing expected in both the Euro zone and Japan. These economic divergences and uncertainties appear to have contributed to the return of volatility across assets. Geopolitical factors have also played their part. At the start of the third quarter, volatility across most financial markets was at historically low levels. Several central bank employees is concerned about this complacency as it potentially reflected the underpricing of risk. There is less cause for this concern now. Volatility has risen consistently across assets, a trend that has continued into the beginning of the fourth quarter. Together these trends impact our business lines in two different ways. First, the growth downgrade and this inflation risk means the low interest rate environment looks likely to stay for a while longer. This continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as high yielding investments mature pay down and have to be reinvested in lower yielding investments currently available in the market. We also continue to experience high levels of deposits and for liquidity reasons maintain those that we view as excess with central banks. Another short run implication of the environment is that the low rates have continued to impact the spread associated with our securities finance business. Second, the benign conditions at the beginning of the third quarter, seems to have void asset values and flows into emerging markets. However, those flows reversed in September as the growth scare impacted risk appetite. This was somewhat offset by the return of volatility in foreign exchange markets. The economic divergence between the U.S. and most of the rest of the world also led to strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the second half of the third quarter. These factors along with heightened risk erosion and an increase in currency market volatility boosted both volumes and FX trading revenues in the third quarter of 2014. Now, I\u2019d like to talk about the growth of our asset servicing and asset management business. Our third quarter 2014 new asset servicing wins totaled approximately $302 billion, representing a range of clients and sectors. 38% of those assets were from outside the U.S. Also included in the new business were 32 new alternative asset servicing mandates. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $250 billion at quarter-end and our current pipeline continued strong. In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $3 billion for the third quarter. The flows were driven by net inflows of $7 billion into EPS and $1 billion into cash [bonds] partially offset by net outflows of $5 billion from largely passive fixed-income institutional mandates. Our success in new business commitments across our franchise reflects our efforts to develop continued focus solutions to a continuous innovation. Given our client focus and ability to differentiate our offerings, we expect to build on our new business momentum for the rest of the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the quarter and outlook for the balance of the year. Mike Bell : Thank you, Jay. Good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to comment regarding the $70 million pre-tax or $53 million after-tax non-operating charge recorded in the third quarter. This charge reflects our intention to seek to resolve some, but not all of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect FX client activities. This charge pertains to indirect FX [spenders] which we disclosed over the past few years. It is important to understand that we do not currently intend to seek to negotiate settlements with respect to all outstanding and potential claims. In addition, our current efforts, even if successful will address only a portion of our potential material legal exposure arising out of our indirect FX client activities. As I\u2019m sure you can appreciate, settlement discussions are confidential and we\u2019re not able to make more specific comments on those matters at this point. Now turning to slide 9 and note that we\u2019re pleased with our year-to-date 2014 EPS, which has increased approximately 10% relative to 2013. Year-to-date 2014 core servicing and management fee revenue increased approximately 8% compared to the same period in 2013, benefiting for both higher equity markets and net new business. As a result of the strong fee growth, year-to-date 2014 total revenue increased approximately 5% despite the downward pressure on net interest revenue from low market interest rates. Third quarter 2014 EPS was $1.35 per share, down from second quarter, but up from third quarter of \u201813. The decrease in EPS from second quarter primarily reflects lower revenue related to securities finance seasonality and a higher tax rate this quarter partially offset by the benefit of our share repurchase program. Compared to the third quarter of 2013, EPS increased primarily due to strong growth in our core servicing and management fees, as well as the benefit of our share repurchase program. Total revenue increased slightly from second quarter even with the seasonal decline in securities finance revenue and increased 8.5% from the third quarter of 2013. Overall, expenses were well controlled in the third quarter, although the result included the benefit from the U.S. dollar relative to second quarter of 2014. The third quarter 2014 operating basis effective tax rate was 31%. We currently expect the full year 2014 operating basis effective tax rate to be in the range of 30% to 31% which implies an expected fourth quarter 2014 rate of approximately 32%. Now, I\u2019ll discuss additional details regarding our operating basis quarterly revenue as outlined on slide 12. Unless otherwise noted, my comments here will focus on the comparison of third quarter 2014 to third quarter 2013. I believe this is more relevant since the sequential quarter comparison includes the effects of the seasonal pattern in securities finance. Importantly, servicing fees continue to perform well, up approximately 8% year-over-year. This reflects stronger global equity markets and net new business. Third quarter 2014 asset management fees increased 14.5% from third quarter of last year, primarily due to stronger global equity markets, net new business and higher performance fees. Money market fee waivers were $11 million in third quarter 2014 which was relatively flat. Trading services revenue increased 5%, reflecting the continued success in our foreign exchange trading which generated higher revenue as a result of increased volumes, partially offset by lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 34%, primarily due to higher volumes in both our enhanced custody and agency businesses. Processing fees and other revenue increased from a year ago, primarily due to higher revenue associated with our tax advantaged investments and other fees partially offset by some valuation adjustments. Our net interest revenue also increased from third quarter of last year, benefiting from a higher level of interest earning assets. I would note that the third quarter 2014 net interest revenue also included a $5 million benefit from the prepayment of a corporate bond. Net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be pressured from the persistent low interest rate environment and the reinvestment of the portfolio in the high quality liquid assets to meet the new liquidity requirements. Many of you\u2019ve had questions regarding the European Central Bank lowering the overnight deposit rate to negative 20 basis points and the related impact on a deposit pricing. As market interest rates have continued to drift lower, we\u2019ve notified our clients on potential for us to charge negative rates or fees on all balances. And as Jay described, our plan is to begin charging for negative rates later this quarter. Based upon our current assessment of market conditions, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2014 to be near the high-end of the $2.25 billion to $2.28 billion range that we previously communicated on our second quarter conference call. This estimate reflects a decline in net interest revenue relative to the third quarter of 2014 actual result, due to the impact of lower market interest rates and the impact of increasing our HQLA to comply with liquidity requirements. It also incorporates our estimated impact of the unfavorable interest rate environment in Europe. Now moving to slide 13, I\u2019ll provide some comments on operating basis expenses. Compared to third quarter of 2013, our total operating expenses increased approximately 7% primarily reflecting new business support, higher regulatory compliance costs higher transaction, processing and occupancy expenses. In addition, third quarter 2013 expenses included the impact of lower employee benefit expenses, resulting from plan changes, and a $30 million benefit related to Lehman Brothers related gains and recoveries. Compared to second quarter of 2014, our total third quarter operating expenses benefited by approximately $16 million, due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Third quarter 2014 compensation employee benefits expenses decreased from second quarter, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower incentive compensation costs. Additionally, third quarter 2014 includes a $4 million credit related to our pension adjustment. Transaction and processing expenses were higher than second quarter, primarily due to higher equity values and higher servicing volumes. Occupancy expenses of a $119 million, increased 3.5% compared to second quarter, due to a one time recovery of $5 million last quarter. Third quarter 2014 other expenses included a $20 million contribution to our charitable foundation partially offset by a $15 million insurance related recovery. In addition, third quarter 2014 other expenses were lower due to some delays of external consulting expenses, which we now expect will be spent in fourth quarter of 2014. Now, I\u2019ll provide comments on our September 30th balance sheet. As you can see on slide 14, our overall approach to managing our investment portfolio has evolved to reflect the impact of complying with emerging liquidity roles which is most evident in an $8 billion of U.S. treasuries that we purchased in third quarter of 2014. We intend to be in full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio requirements by January 1, 2015. Our interest rate risk position also reflects the impacts of our actions to comply with the LCR roles and we remain comfortable with this risk position. Additionally, the after tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of September 30, was $411 million which is lower than June 30th due to a modest increase in market interest rates partially offset by an improvement from narrowing spreads. Now turning to slide 15 to review our capital position. Our capital position remained strong and that strength has enabled us to deliver on our key priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of September 30 of 2014, our holding company Tier 1 common ratio under the current Basel III advanced approach was 12.7%. Under the Basel III standardize approach, which will not go into effect until 2015, our holding company estimated pro forma Tier 1 common ratio was approximately 10.9%. We estimate that our Basel III supplementary leverage ratios under our interpretation of the final U.S. rules are approximately 5.7% at the holding company and approximately 5.4% at the bank as of September 30, 2014. Generally speaking, our capital ratios were lower in third quarter of 2014 versus second quarter. The main contributors to the decline were a larger average balance sheet driven in part by higher levels of client deposits and the reduction in common equity from the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar following through foreign currency translation. Now as I mentioned, returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top priority. During the third quarter of 2014, we purchased approximately 5.8 million shares of our common stocks at a total cost of approximately $410 million resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $430 million for the quarter. As of September 30, 2014, we had approximately $880 million remaining on our current common stock purchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015. So by way of summary, third quarter 2014 results were driven by the strength of our core servicing and management fees and positive momentum in creating services. Core servicing and management fees grew 8% compared to year-to-date 2013 which demonstrates our success in the market. In spite the headwinds on our net interest revenue; we're well positioned to achieve our full year 2014 operating basis revenue growth target of 3% to 5%. On the expense front, we continue to feel pressure from higher regulatory expectations. And in addition, we continue to believe that our common stock repurchase program combined with dividends is the best way to return value to shareholders. So prior to wrapping up, I thought I\u2019ll address a question that is likely to be on investors and the analysts minds and that is, what is our outlook for fourth quarter 2014? Fourth quarter revenue performance could be impacted by overall market conditions in the quarter. In addition as I mentioned earlier, we expect fourth quarter net interest revenue to decrease relative to the third quarter 2014 results. We currently expect fourth quarter 2014 expenses to be higher due to the continued upward pressure on our regulatory-related costs and the delayed timing of some expenses from third quarter. Nevertheless, our goal is to generate positive operating leverage for the full year 2014, although the fourth quarter market conditions pose risk that are not completely in our direct control. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks Mike. And Stephanie, we're now -- Mike and I are now available to open the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Thanks. Good morning guys. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Just wondering if you could talk about the two core fee businesses in a little bit more depth, and services first, you had a modest growth and I am just wondering if you can help us understand the impact of FX and also just the commentary on the transaction activity this quarter versus last? Jay Hooley : Yes. Let me start that Ken and Mike will pick it up. As far as core services I\u2019d start with the custody service fee base, which was up nicely year-over-year, up a little bit quarter-to-quarter. A reflection in order to priority the markets and we continue to see stronger business growth. We posted $2 billion of new committed business this quarter; there is 250 still to install. So we\u2019ve had a couple of nice quarters of good momentum in the marketplace. Let me just bridge into foreign exchange, which was another positive performer in the quarter. So, a few things, the volumes and volatility were helper in the third quarter. And I would say, volumes consistently, volatility really moving from front to back of quarter improved September in particular given the things that I noted. I\u2019d also broaden it out to say that foreign exchange is a pretty wide variety of service capabilities which we provide both to our custody customers, as well as our non-custody customers. And we continue to see good momentum in I would say generally the electronic trading part of foreign exchange, FX Connect and more recently 3FX, which is the hourly priced against an index. And even more recently in September, we introduced a new FX vehicle called TruCross, which is designed to allow those who don't want to trade against the WM fix to -- basically it's a trading platform buy side to buy side. So, I would say, market environment was good particularly towards the end of the quarter and generally volumes were pretty consistent across all platforms. Mike, I don't know you want to add. Mike Bell : Yes. Ken, just add a couple of other facts just to support your quarter-over-quarter analysis. So relative to second quarter, the stronger U.S. dollar depressed our service fees by $10 million. So, if you\u2019ve done it on a constant currency basis rather than 1.302, it would be 1.312, if you used constant currency. In addition, the transaction revenue was down $4 million sequentially. Obviously we've got a little bit of help from market, so there were pretty sideways if you include Europe. So, as you can see, the underlying net new business revenue was very helpful in the core GS business here in Q3. As it relates to management fees, as I said in my prepared remarks, the main benefit that we got there relative to second quarter is a combination of positive net new business as well as our performance fees; there the FX impact was negative two from a sequential standpoint. And in grand total for our revenue, so inclusive of $12 million I just talked about, FX hurt revenue by approximately $21 million relative to Q2 and had a little bit less from that impact on the expenses Q2 to Q3. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay, great. And my second question is just to your commentary on the push out in some of those consulting costs into the fourth quarter. Can you help us understand what didn\u2019t get spend this quarter and the type of magnitude that you\u2019re talking about from a third quarter to fourth quarter overall increase in expenses? Mike Bell : Sure, absolutely Ken. So this mainly relates Ken to the timing of our regulatory compliance spending, so it\u2019s mainly outside consultants. And so basically where we expected to spend on outside consultancy in Q3, we expect that now still to be spent, but delayed into Q4. And I would range that in the call it $10 million to $15 million kind of range. Now I\u2019d emphasize the operating expenses category as I talked about in the past, could be pretty lumpy, because we can add some, for example some legal costs in there and even the outside consulting spend tends to be pretty lumpy. But that was what I was referencing. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay, got it. So overall expenses, you are still -- and sometimes you typically have like a true up maybe on the comp side. But are you trying to also say that you expect overall expenses then to be distinctly higher in the fourth or just that portion of it? Mike Bell : No, we do expect it to be distinctly higher, so the guidance that I had given at Q2 where we thought that Q3 would be 20 million higher than Q2 and Q4 would be 20 million higher than Q2, in aggregate there really has not been a change in our expense view other than number one with the stronger U.S. dollar, we got $16 million benefit in expenses in Q3. Obviously the Q4 benefit, if U.S. dollar continues to be strong will be what it\u2019ll be relative to Q2, but the currency helped the expense of $16 million in Q3. And then as I said, the timing between the two quarters will reflect the delay in the spending that I just mentioned. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Understood. Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next quarter comes from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Good morning guys. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Mike, just hoping you could flash out where you stand on LCR today and just your latest thoughts around preferred issuance? Mike Bell : Sure. Good morning Ashley. Regarding LCR, as we\u2019ve talked about previously, we do expect to fully be in compliance by year-end with the Fed's expectations. And we estimate that if we calculated that LCR as of September 30th, we would be in excess of the 80%. Now, I would tell you that following up on a question you asked me last quarter Ashley, the final Fed expectations regarding the actual calculation of operational deposits is not entirely clear. It's sort of slowly getting clear but not entirely clear. And that\u2019s as a result, following up on the question you asked me last quarter, at some point, we need to firm up the overall impact on our NIR. I would expect it to be modestly higher impact than what we had communicated previously but we\u2019ll have some more information on that in 2015. And as it relates to the preps, first of all, no change in that for the risk based capital ratios; we would ultimately want to get to 1.5% at a minimum of our overall capital structure being prep. So that would equate to approximately $1.8 billion. So that means we need another $500 million at some point relative to the balance of preps that we have currently. So just looking at the risk based ratios, no change in our expectations. The wildcard continues to be, Ashley, around compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio. And since at this point, it still looks like the supplementary leverage ratio will likely be our binding constraint. I would say it is likely we will go beyond the $1.8 billion that I just referenced and ultimately issue more press than that. Again at this point, I wouldn\u2019t give an updated number or an update on timing, but that continues to be our thinking. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks for the color there. And then just on the current reinvestment environment, I appreciate the guidance for this year. But just maybe a sense around what the reinvesting deals are in the U.S. versus Europe? And then any thoughts on what a flatter yield curve means for you in net interest revenue sensitivity would be appreciated? Mike Bell : Sure. Well, as you can imagine, it\u2019s a little early to talk about 2015 because there are so many different moving parts going on there. Obviously, if we got to a flatter yield curve by an increase in short-term interest rates, we would view that as a very positive thing, particularly given that we\u2019ve got about half of our portfolio is invested in floating rate securities. So, an increase in short-term rates will be very helpful. I would also reiterate that we will particularly benefit from the first call it 50 basis point increase in -- the first 25 basis point of increase in short-term rates would likely accrue very heavily to our benefit, but even the second 25 basis point increase would also help us. So, if we get to a flat yield curve by raising the short-term rates that would be a very good thing. As it relates to Q4, we\u2019ve got some obvious headwinds. We\u2019ve got first of all, Q4 you don\u2019t want to back out the $5 million benefit we got in Q3 from the prepayment on that corporate bond, so I would do that right off the top. But then we\u2019ve got three other items that are driving down our expectations for NIR in fourth quarter. They are; number one, Europe, as you just mentioned, the market interest rates in Europe have dropped between 20 and 25 basis points at the short-end over the last five months. The [ECB] has obviously cut the rate from zero now to minus 20 in that same period. So, as Jay talked about, we're working to pass along that cost to our clients. So, but that will still be a headwind for Q4. In addition, we have now higher level of HQLA that's going to be a drag because we're obviously not doing any spread on the HQLA. And then third is just a normal grind as the portfolio matures and rolls off. So, as a result of all those things, we expect Q4 to be lower than Q3 from an NIR perspective. I think it's too early to try to speculate on 2015. Ashley Serrao - Credit Suisse : Great. Thanks for all the details there, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Just ISI. Thank you. Jay Hooley : Excellent. Glenn Schorr - ISI: And I don't have a [bow] either. So, just one point Mike on the clarification of the 4Q costs, in a standing steady state world, currency neutral fourth quarter from third quarter. We might add back that $16 million benefit on currency, the $10 million to $15 million catch up on the delayed consulting cost and then another $20 million on top for what was already planned on the consulting cost. I just want to make sure that I have that right? Mike Bell : Yes that's fair, Glenn. I mean that probably puts more precision on it than it is warranted because again some of those other operating expenses are pretty lumpy. But directionally you are thinking about it just fine. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. And then on the regulatory question, we think of them as having a big seasonal component, because basically June through December is hot and heavy, or is this annual run rate thought process? In other words, should we get a benefit in first quarter as CCAR\u2019s done and you take a breath? Mike Bell : Yes. Unfortunately Glenn, I mean there are a lot of moving parts to answer your question. You're certainly right that I would expect CCAR specific cost particularly outside consulting expenses to decline in Q1 of \u201815. But unfortunately, CCAR is just part of a wide horizon of regulatory expectation. So, I think it\u2019s a little early to speculate on Q1 2015 or even full year 2015 regulatory compliance costs; we\u2019re in the midst of the budget process as we speak. Again, a lot of moving parts, just to sort of give you a flavor for it, first of all I said before, we\u2019re seeing regulatory expenses, excuse me, regulatory expectations be higher in a number of different areas, not just CCAR. So that\u2019s putting some upward pressure on expenses. On the other hand, we do expect over the course of 2015 to be able to reduce our reliance on outside consulting expenses and ultimately replace that more with full time employees. So we expect to get some cost arbitrage there. So again, a little early to try to conclude on 2015 at this point. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay. And then maybe just a very high level thought because it\u2019s so new. CCAR stress test came out last night. And I would just say particular to you guys balance sheet\u2019s grown 27%, it\u2019s help to offset some of the NIM compression. But the test specifically has wider credit spreads and a flatter curve relative to last year. Is this just a little bit worse, is a lot worse? I\u2019m just trying to get your gut reaction given the importance of that part of the test for you guys. Mike Bell : Glenn, obviously we've had less than 24 hours to fully digest it and to run it through our models and such. But I would characterize it as modestly worse than last years, but again with the caveat that I am sure there will be some other devils in the details. But particularly the fact that the equity market decline would be higher than last year would be a particular area given our concentration in terms of our clients on equity assets. Glenn Schorr - ISI: Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Hey guys, good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : So, a bigger picture question I guess when we think about State Street\u2019s exposure to Europe. You guys clearly have significant business there and there is number. There is not a place as obviously where it hits the P&L, both on the NIR side with respect to securities rolling over but also as you kind of translate from euros to the dollar. As we think about the enterprise as a whole, strengthening dollar I am assuming is not a great thing but maybe you can flush that out a little bit more and give us a sense of from a pre-tax dollar perspective what the sensitivity could be? Jay Hooley : Let me start that because I think it has -- there is a revenue side to that and there is an expense side. And Mike can pick up the currency effect as well as the effect potentially on the portfolio. But from a revenue side being our ability to generate servicing fees and management fees really unaffected, it\u2019s anything neutral to positive. I think if you look at our new business momentum over the past several quarters, Europe has been a little bit of a bright spot. I\u2019d even go a little deeper to say if you look at flows which is the other element of a critical element of organic flows; the offshore markets continue to perform exceptionally well, Thailand and Luxembourg where we had deep presence. So, from a standpoint of the fee revenues, I don\u2019t really see effect that the Euro zone continues to have difficulties affecting that, in fact if anything that\u2019s a little bit positive. Mike, why don\u2019t you talk about that? Mike Bell : Sure. So, Alex, first from a P&L standpoint, I would characterize this as being relatively neutral to the FX changes because roughly speaking, it\u2019s not perfectly accurate, but roughly speaking, our revenue in different currencies tends to match our expense structure in different currencies. So, I would characterize this as roughly neutral out there. As it relates to the impact on our capital levels, we\u2019re modestly exposed, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as material, but we\u2019re modestly exposed to the fact that we\u2019ve got some capital in non-U.S. currencies. And therefore -- and that\u2019s really weighted a little more heavily than for example the risk weighted assets in those same currencies. So as an example, what we saw at the end of third quarter was when the euro weakened so much relative to the U.S. dollar, we saw an impact on the September 30th currency translation and therefore that negatively impacted our capital ratios at Q3. Once again, I don\u2019t view that as a long-term threat, but I do view it as a source of fluctuation that can go either way quarter-to-quarter. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Got it. Thanks for all that detail. And then the second question is -- and I appreciate the fact that it\u2019s still probably quite early. But as we think about NSFR and the way it could impact the broader securities lending industry. I was just hoping to get your thoughts on your business with respect to; a, your growth in enhanced custody to you think can stand where does you see a little bit of a principle business for you, but also the secondary impact and kind of what your core agency business? Jay Hooley : So, let me start at Alex. Mike noted that our securities finance business this quarter was particularly healthy when you contrast it against last year\u2019s same quarter. And the growth was driven by better loan volume overall I would say of the growth. Two-thirds of it roughly was enhanced custody versus the agency business. So, generally good strength in the securities lending business, I don't see that abating. I think your question was to the NSFR. In our enhanced custody business, we have found ways to minimize the capital effect through netting with the counterparties that we\u2019re lending securities to, which has resulted in a pretty capital efficient trade. So, as we look at enhanced custody, which is a business that we see not only have seen good growth in, but we see the prospect for even increased growth. We think it can be done on a reasonably capital efficient basis. Mike would you add to that? Mike Bell : Yes. Alex the only thing I would add that Jay is exactly right. The only thing I would add is that I do expect that prices will likely increase in that market particularly for those clients where we can't reach netting agreements with them. And I don't think that would be just us, I think that will be a phenomenon across the marketplace. So, our orally read is exactly what Jay said. We do expect this to be attractive business for us from the capital return standpoint overtime particularly with the [NIM]. Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs : Understood. Thank you. Thanks so much for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Good morning. Just following up Alex\u2019s question, I was curious if you could elaborate on it appears to be a little bit of improvement in securities lending, you seem to think that\u2019s maybe a little bit durable. But perhaps you could address what you\u2019re seeing in terms of structural changes since the crisis, what types of splits you\u2019re getting with client, the level of participation programs and the demand for activity related to collateral versus special lending? Jay Hooley : Let me start that again Luke. If I take it up and broaden it, the participation securities lending from a customer standpoint has been stable to maybe slightly up. So, we\u2019ve come through a long cycle over the past six years of people leaving the program then rejoining the program. And that\u2019s been pretty stable if not say anything it\u2019s a plus some adds. If you look at the -- now the other thing you\u2019d look at would be unknown balances which have been over the past couple of quarters running at about $350 billion plus or minus. Within that the loan growth has been good and the attractiveness of spread is particularly driven by merger and acquisition activity driving specials. Again has been a positive in the last couple of quarters. You asked about structural changes, the one that comes to my -- most to me is this decrease in leverage that the banks are going through. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen the prime brokers be a little bit more selective about lending, which has really opened the window for that enhanced custody business that we frequently talk about. So, I would say if you look at sustainability, durability of trends that are going on, you can make your own judgment about whether the M&A activity will continue to be robust. But other than that, I think I would say it looks pretty durable from the standpoint of trend. Mike Bell : Yes, Luke. It's Mike. The only thing that I would add is just thinking about it from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, first of all with the bad news and then with the good news. On the bad news side, Q1 was pretty difficult, spreads were tight. But as Jay said, we saw with the dividend arm season spreads and volumes pick up in Q2; in Q3 the volumes and spreads were attractive for example relative to a year ago. And again we attribute that primarily to higher M&A volume, higher IPO volume, and again whether it's durable into the future is a little bit of a crystal ball question but we're certainly happy with the trends we've seen over the last six months. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Great. Really helpful. And then on the FX settlements, I think I recall a few years ago when this broke, you seemed fairly resolute that the cases that didn't have a lot of merit. And I know it's difficult to say much given that you still have a number of cases pending, but maybe hoping you could provide some detail about why you decided it was in your best interest to settle in these specific cases? And then maybe in terms of order of magnitude or just number of cases how much of this might be behind us? Mike Bell : Yes, Luke. First of all, just to be clear, we're not announcing settlement on these cases but these are basically situations where we are putting up reserves based upon additional information that we have. And I would not try to speculate what percentage of the overall pie this is going to relate to in terms of the indirect FX business; I think it\u2019s way too early to try to size that. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the clarification. And then just a real quick technical question; wondering how you plan to charge for negative rates, whether you determine that will appear as a credit to NII or the fee more or is that going to just differ across other clients? Mike Bell : Yes. Luke, it\u2019s likely to differ by client and differ by country, so different by a jurisdiction but I would expect at this point speculating that the vast bulk of that would show up as positive fees. But once again, more to come there. Luke Montgomery - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Good morning guys. Thanks for the taking the question. First one on the balance sheet. So, we saw a pretty nice sequential increase in deposits here. How much of that was non-operating? And do you have any insight into what might have driven some of the growth given how strong it was? Mike Bell : Yes Brennan, it\u2019s Mike. First of all, we expect -- we estimate that the underlying growing in our core business was about call it $2 billion to 3 billion of the growth in our overall deposits. And the remainder of the growth in the balance sheet was a combination of growth in excess deposits as well as some issuance of wholesale CDs which were an important part of our plan to comply with the LCR. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay. And that $2 billion to $3 billion is both U.S. and international? Mike Bell : That\u2019s correct. That would be a combined number. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Okay, terrific. And then thinking about the delta in SLR, clearly balance sheet growth was part of the drop there, sequential 40 basis points; AOCI looked like it fell too. Were those the main drivers and could you break down the 40 basis points and what were the main allocations specifically the big factors? Mike Bell : Sure Brennan. So, those are the two main pieces. The growth in the balance sheet was approximately two-thirds of the 40 basis-point decline in the SLR and the other third when you\u2019re referencing AOCI, that's mainly the currency translation adjustment that I mentioned earlier, what we saw a drop in the euro rate pretty significantly at September 30th. Again from foreign currency translation standpoint, that's calculated on a spot basis based on currency rates as of September 30. So, it had a -- the drop in the euro had a disproportionate negative impact on the value of our euro capital as it gets converted to U.S. dollars and that was about a third of the 40 basis-point decline. Brennan Hawken - UBS: Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : So, just a couple of follow-ups, one on the [Altera], I just wanted to make sure I understood it will be 80% by 1/1/15 and the 100% is the next year 1/1/16. Is that accurate? Mike Bell : Betsy, let me just repeat what I said earlier. We do expect to be comfortably well above the 80% at 1/1/15. We do estimate that we'd be above the 80% as of now. But we would expect to have a very comfortable margin relative to the 80% at 1/1/15. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : I just wondered because you mentioned full compliance, so I wasn\u2019t sure if that meant full compliance with the interim step or the final step so? Jay Hooley : Yes. Again, I would characterize this as we\u2019re in full compliance of the 80% now, but the -- I do think at the end of the day our regulators would expect overtime for us to have a significant buffer relative to the 80% and I would expect to meet that buffer at 1150. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then on just the European deposits and the negative interest rate you\u2019re going to be charging due to the fact that ECB is charging you 20 bps. Can you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re talking about with clients? And I\u2019m wondering is there a way that some of your clients can avoid this potentially from going from euro to another currency or through getting discounts for more soft dollars or is there -- just wanted to understand how your positioning is? Jay Hooley : Betsy, this is Jay. First off, 45 days ago we informed customers of our intent. I think to me the question will be, is this charge enough to cause people to deal with their excess deposits in a different way. We would expect that there will be some for those deposits and that\u2019s probably a positive thing overall for us. But I don\u2019t think it would cause customers to change investment strategies or anything that would relate to those excess deposits, I think it\u2019s just a matter of -- is the charge enough of a deterrent to keep deposits with us and therefore would they could they in some form move some of those deposits away from our balance sheet. But I think that\u2019s the extent of the impact. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Have you seen any activity to-date from when you announced you were intending to charge this? I'm wondering if people have already started to move out of euro to other currencies or you just really haven't seen much behavioral change yet? Jay Hooley : We have not seen any behavioral change. And while we think about the intent, we won't start charging until later on in the quarter. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Right. Okay. And then just lastly on the preps, I know you indicated that there is another plug for us to do here at some point when market conditions -- I'm just wondering what's your sense on that kind of timing or when you'd want to get that done. You probably were thinking maybe to do it by the end of 3Q that just passed for CCAR reasons. But just like to get a sense as to how you're thinking about it given the fact that some restrictions come down so much. Is there an opportunity here? Jay Hooley : Sure. And Betsy, this is something that we're looking at. At this point, I wouldn't commit to a specific timing. But I would say just to give up a high level answer, I would certainly expect within the next 12 months that we would look for a potential window to go ahead and get a $500 million, but it will depend upon market conditions, it will depend upon our outlook. So, I'd say a number of different factors to think about. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi. I wanted to go back to lend a little bit. Jay, how do you view the market share shifts in overall custody? On the one hand you mentioned that the strong new business growth this quarter, which is a positive. On the other hand, it looks like some smaller players in Europe wants the mandates over the past year. And even further back just a big picture question. When we look at State Street's market share almost a decade ago and adjust for your acquisitions of Goldman in 2012, Intesa in 2009, Investor\u2019s Financial in 2007. It looks like your market share on a core basis adjusting for those acquisitions would be a little bit less in overall custody, regardless of what degree of [discrete], how you think about that market share would be helpful? Jay Hooley : Sure. I can\u2019t track all the numbers that you have Mike without doing a little math on my own but I would say generally we focus, we\u2019re most concerned about market share in the most attractive markets that as we view them. So, if you look at I would say, starting out broadly asset servicing -- not asset servicing, but asset management versus asset owners, so investment management versus pension funds, by our math, we have held if not gained market share over long periods of time in the asset servicing for asset managers; pension funds probably a little bit more stable. So that would be my first cut at it. But then I would probably go a little deeper Mike, and if you look at some other faster growing streams in the world, I\u2019d start with the alternatives, hedge, private equity, real-estate, 10 years ago we were nowhere that was in the market, today we\u2019re the market leader by quite a bit and I think are positioned to continue to grow and gain share. I\u2019d look at another fast stream; I\u2019m in the U.S. right now, primarily ETF market which is close to $2 trillion now. We have a pretty significant share of the ETF servicing marketplace, so again fast growing market where we have established early position and have grown disproportionately with the market. And then, I guess the third place I would go is the derivative of the asset management market, if you look at the European market where we have a deep presence. Our market share leadership in both the Irish and Luxembourg offshore markets is pretty commanding and I would say continuing to grow. So, I look at the question and I break it down as I always do to say, as you look you in your crystal ball, which of the geographies, which is the markets, and which are the products that we think have a higher growth trajectories and making sure. I think we've done a pretty good job and getting in front of those growth markets that have turned out to be pretty attractive. So, that's one cut at it. Mike Mayo - CLSA: That's helpful. And so just going back to the core custody business away from those growth areas that you emphasized, how is competition currently compared to the past? Is it getting easier and you're gaining more business that way or is it harder or what's the rate of change? Jay Hooley : I would say it never gets easier. But I think it's I would say largely unchanged. I would say and it depends a lot by market. In the U.S., there are two or three different verticals, you have mostly U.S. competitors, we all have strength and weaknesses. If you go to Europe, you'll introduce a few additional competitors. I would say Mike that over the years following the financial crisis and particularly last couple of years, pricing has seemed a little bit more stable to me; there can be a situation where somebody will throw in irresponsible place. But I would say most of us in the servicing side of the business are being a little bit more careful about and thoughtful I should say about how we price these opportunities. I\u2019d also say what's helped that and I know we\u2019ve done some of this, but we're not alone is particularly when you have an intermediary in the sales process, a consultant in particular. We\u2019ve been really to walk away from deals that didn\u2019t make economic sense; I\u2019ve seen others do that as well. And I think over time that can create a little bit of a firming up or bottoming of the pricing. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Are you willing to give up market share when the pricing doesn\u2019t make sense a little more often? Jay Hooley : Absolutely. Mike Mayo - CLSA: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Hi, good morning folks. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just couple of more to drill down a little bit deeper. On the -- just looking at the average balance sheet on the deposit pricing, I guess first of all, take a picture of what do you view as your level of excess deposits right now? And then in terms of the impact, if you can go into a little bit more granularity on charging for -- when you charge for deposits later in the quarter, how that\u2019s going to impact the -- just looking at the average balance sheet, the average yield on your interest bearing deposits down 5 basis points linked quarter. How you see that dynamic changing because you mentioned there will be a fee offset; and where that would come in on fees on the P&L? Mike Bell : Okay. So Brian, it's Mike. First of all, on your question on excess deposits, we estimate that our excess deposits at the end of -- I\u2019m sorry not at the end of third quarter, during the average of third quarter was approximately $48 billion. And so we expect that in third quarter, we were earning a NIM on those assets, call it in the high-teens, down what we\u2019ve given in the past an estimated NIM on excess deposits of 20 basis points. The fact that the rates dropped in euro, the short-term interest rates dropped in euro, call it 20 to 25 basis points over the last five months mean that would push the overall NIM down to the teen\u2019s level. I would expect that there is at least the potential for the excess deposits to decline in Q4 if in fact the [rural] excess deposits that we\u2019re getting in negative rate would go somewhere else, but that's speculated I probably speculated that all year and that long as excess deposits continue to grow. So I don't know how much confidence that gives you in that estimate. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : But then as you charge for this, assuming some of the deposits stay we should see a pick up in the net interest margin that you just outlined from the high-teens? Mike Bell : I think I'm not sure that's actually the case because we're likely to pick up a partial quarter for the most part, and maybe modestly higher fee revenue as a result of charging for deposit. So, I don't think that's going to help the NIR per se. We're earning negative interest rates on the asset side of those excess deposits. And again I think the negative rate credit decline will show up likely in all likelihood of fees not improves NIR. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Then [segueing] to fees, first of all would that show up in the core investment service fee line? And then secondarily, if you back out the impacts you said from both volumes and FX currency translation versus the second quarter, your fee growth is actually stronger about 2%. So, just going back into some of Jay's comments earlier about some of the risk-off, I think you were saying, Jay some of the risk-off in later September looking into fourth quarter. How should we think about that positioning in terms of your yield on those custody and the [liquid] assets? Mike Bell : So Brian on your first piece again, I do think that negative credited rates on deposits in Europe would likely show up in the service fees. I mean we\u2019re talking a few million dollars I mean this is not a big ticket item. So, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to hugely move the needle relative to the other factors. And I\u2019m just going back to the earlier question, I wouldn\u2019t say that for the most part the improvement that we got Q2 to Q3 in global services revenues X the impact of currency and X the impact of transaction it was mainly net new business volumes. Jay wants to comment on the risk-on risk-off question. Jay Hooley : Yes. I would say, picking up on my prepared remarks, Brian, there was a little bit of risk-on at the beginning of the quarter and became risk-off at the end of the quarter somewhat offset by the volatility in foreign exchange or currency markets. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Jay Hooley : And the equity markets have come back a little bit, so it\u2019s hard to predict at this point. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank : All right, okay. No, that\u2019s helpful color. Great, thanks very much. Operator : And your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: Hi Mike. A quick question for you, on this incentive comp reduction that you had in the third quarter, was there a reversal of an accrual and if so how much? Mike Bell : Yes. Vivek, there is not a reversal of an accrual in terms of incentive comp. What happens is that the way we accrue incentive comp it tends to accrue based upon our overall level of earnings I mean there are some adjustments that go into it plus and minus. But as a result of again those factors, the accrual was slightly lower. That was not a material impact in the quarter itself. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: Okay. And then secondly, your ABS came down pretty sharply in the quarter, while I guess treasuries went up. So that's the change going on, I'm presuming. And how much more do you need to do in that? Mike Bell : So, first of all, you are right in terms of your description. We did have a major security sale in the quarter and basically reinvested the proceeds in U.S. treasuries that's all part of being LCR compliance. In terms of how much more we need to do, as I mentioned in an answer to an earlier question, the overall regulatory expectations regarding the calculation of operational deposits under the LCR requirements is still not entirely clear. So, I\u2019d rather not try to be pin down to a number, when it's a moving target at this point. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : You mentioned that the net interest income impact from the LCR was probably going to be a big higher than you discussed previously. So, I wonder what was in the final rules that were different from what you've been expecting. Mike Bell : Yes, Geoff, it's Mike. I'd assume a number of different factors and some of it actually relates to the underlying expectations of the calculation itself as opposed to change in the rules. But as an example, we have what we view to be operational deposits from both hedge fund clients as well as private equity clients that are explicitly excluded from the regulatory definition of operational deposits. I mean we view that as unfortunate, but those are the rules. So that would be an example of something that will push up our need to hold more HQLA that we previously thought. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : And then my second question is on the FX trading revenues. Can you give a sense of how those were distributed over the quarter; was there a big pick up late in the quarter as (inaudible) came back or was it kind of more even throughout? Jay Hooley : I would say, Geoff, this is Jay. It was slightly tilted towards the back end of the quarter, followed the volatility change throughout the quarter that I mentioned; volumes were pretty steady throughout. Mike Bell : Geoff, it\u2019s Mike. I would just add the volumes have really been strong, as Jay indicated. So again, we view that as a very positive thing and also a positive sign that the investments that we\u2019ve made in our direct FX capabilities over the last several years are really paying good dividends. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Right. So strong volumes were out and that kind of take it from the volatility at the end? Mike Bell : Correct. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Good morning. Just a follow-up on the preferred issuance thought process around the SLR. It seems to me that if you take a balance sheet back to where it was a year ago and assume some of these excess deposits run-off, as rates eventually move higher. You add based on my back of the envelop, almost 100 basis points to SLR and then all of a sudden it\u2019s not a constraint. So as you think about meeting that at least temporary constraint with preferred, does it make sense to wait to see how the excess deposits? I just want to get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about the additional preferred above 1.5%? Mike Bell : Sure Jim, it\u2019s Mike. First, what you're describing is rational and that is part of the overall calculus in terms of the prep issuance as I was mentioning to Betsy; there are a number of different things to think about. One of those of course is what will happen to excess deposits, particularly when rates rise. The other piece though that you didn't mention and I feel compelled to mention is remember that by the time we get to 2018 and the SLR is fully in effect, we will have lost all of the interim credit on the intangibles. And so we estimate that that's worth about 40 basis points. So on a pro forma the 5.4 down to 5.0 for the loss of that credit on the tangibles. And then as you said, you could considerably boost it by a 100 basis points if you assumed all the excess deposits found in different home. We probably still want to have some kind of buffer off the six. So I wouldn't characterize preps as being our only lever but that would be a scenario where we might meet all the items that you mentioned and still end up with additional preps. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay. That's helpful and makes sense. And then just maybe a follow up on the NSFR, have you looked at all how that may impact the way you think; is there more liquidity you need about the LCR, or do you feel like the NSFR is at the least the way it's proposed so far is pretty manageable? Mike Bell : Jim, again, as you can imagine, it's early since we don't have any final rules to evaluate. I think it would be a little bit early to say anything definitively. I think based upon our interpretation of the preliminary guidance, it would require some additional HQLA, but I think the devil will be in the details of the final rules and I wouldn't try to speculate and try to put a number on it at this point. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Adam Beatty - Bank of America : Thank you and good morning. Just one question from me today; in regards to your operating leverage target, I was just wondering given where your business sits right now and where the market conditions are? Would you need in terms of it be subject to market conditions would you need the market to revert to more of an upward trend with flat from here allowing you to achieve operating leverage, what\u2019s the color around that? Also it seems like you\u2019re somewhat confident about heading your goal in terms of revenue growth, to me that sort of points to expenses as maybe the risk around operating leverage maybe if you could just flag up the biggest risk that you see? Thanks. Mike Bell : Sure. Adam, it\u2019s Mike. Again, there are number of different factors that will impact the Q4 revenue. Obviously as we talked about earlier, we were pleased with the Q3 results in particularly the strength in our core servicing and management fees and then the additional benefit that we got from the strong direct FX trading results and also the securities lending business both enhanced custody and the agency businesses, obviously we\u2019re pleased with all of that. Exactly what conditions are going to be in Q4 in all of those areas; it\u2019s too early to tell. Having said that, we\u2019re at 5% year-over-year revenue growth through nine months, I certainly expect that we\u2019ll [barrowing] that catastrophe meet the 3% to 5% overall revenue target. But you\u2019re absolutely right; the expenses have been a headwind for 2014 mainly the regulatory compliance costs are the main item that we had not anticipated at the beginning of the year when we were laying out our budget targets and expectations for full year. I think we\u2019ve actually done a pretty good job in Q3 offsetting the impact of the higher regulatory expenses by finding other savings in other areas and opportunities to redeploy staff as opposed to having it all be incremental. But I certainly would not argue with your point that expenses have been a risk factor throughout the year relative to where we started the year. Adam Beatty - Bank of America : Thanks Mike. I appreciate it. Operator : And your last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Thank you. Good morning guys. Mike can you share with us the duration of the bond portfolio extended out slightly this quarter to 2.1 years. What's your comfort level, how far out would you consider going? Mike Bell : Sure Gerard. Well first of all, I think it's important to understand that there has been no change at our philosophy or overall approach to interest rate risk in this quarter. You are right that the duration of the portfolio increased modestly. But importantly, please realize as well that our central bank deposits increased significantly in the quarter as well. So, we ended up on average for the quarter with central bank deposits of $53 billion. So, when I think about the duration of the asset side of our balance sheet, I look at it as a combination of the investment portfolio with as you said, the duration of a shade over two and the central bank deposits, which have a duration obviously of zero. And as part of the LCR compliance, we've had increase our HQLA revenues significantly. We've done that through an increase in central bank deposits, but also an increase in U.S. treasuries. Weighted together, I don't view it as a material change relative to Q2 or Q3. And certainly there has not been a change in philosophy. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Great. And then second, can you remind us; you touched a little bit on earlier in the call that you\u2019d benefit obviously from a rise in short-term rates and if the curve flattened initially, that would be positive. If we were to get a 100 basis-point rise and rates, what kind of favorable impact in net interest revenue would that be? Mike Bell : Yes. Gerard, I think that\u2019s a difficult one, because it will depend upon a number of different factors, not the least of which is whether the excess deposits that we have the $40 billion of excess deposits that we had in Q3 stick around or not. We do put some sensitivities out in the 10-Q. Again those based on static client behavior. And again our own thinking Gerard is that if we did see, certainly if we saw 100 basis-point increase in short-term rates, we believe that the vast bulk if not all of the $48 billion would likely find the home somewhere else. So I think it\u2019d be difficult to try to quantify that. I think the way -- I\u2019d say how I think about it, I think about it as if we get a 25 basis-point increase in rates, particularly short-term rates, I think we will get a benefit on the asset side of the equation, particularly the half of the portfolio that is affording rate portfolio, we\u2019d expect this would get the bulk of the 25 basis-point benefit on that half. On the half that\u2019s fixed investment rate will get that over time as the portfolio rolls over. And with rates of essentially forward in so many jurisdictions, we wouldn\u2019t expect much move in the liability side. And then as we\u2019ve talked about the second 25 basis points, it\u2019s a little more shared between us in our clients and then it\u2019s different beyond that. But overall, I would characterize this as a net item, but not one that I would try to quantify at this point beyond what we put out in the Q. Gerard Cassidy - RBC: Great, thank you very much. Jay Hooley : Stephanie, I want to thank you and thank everybody else for joining us today on the call. And we look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the fourth quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Anthony. And good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results reflect strength across asset servicing and asset management businesses. Despite the low interest rate environment in 2014, our revenue experienced solid growth compared to 2013 from both asset servicing and asset management. As a result, operating basis total fee revenue for 2014 exceeded 2013 by 7.4%. Our focus on developing and delivering solutions to serve client's evolving need continues to position us well against strong global growth trend. As a result of this, we achieve new asset servicing commitment in 2014 of $1.1 trillion including approximately $400 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. And net new assets to be managed of $28 billion including $7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. We are pleased that we have successfully completed our Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation program on schedule and at the high end of our guided range. I want to acknowledge the efforts of the entire State Street team for helping us complete this important initiative. Going forward, managing our expenses and continuing to drive efficiencies across the organization remain a priority despite continued pressure on regulatory costs. Now I'd like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. U.S. equity market end of the fourth quarter on a robust footing. But that thinly disguise the fact the quarter was characterized by greater uncertainty. US economic news continues to surprise to the upside but the collapse in commodity prices fuel fears of our growth outside of the U.S. This prompted significant moves in commodity- linked assets from the currencies of commodity exporters such as the Russian ruble to asset such as high-yield corporate bonds of energy producers here in the United States. We are only just beginning to observe the economic implications of those commodities swings. We believe they will exacerbate the downward pressure on already falling global inflation rate and impact expectations of movements in monetary policy.  Long-term bond yields fell considerably to reflect this. The decrease in long-term bond yield was most notable in the Eurozone. In September, the ECB cut its administered rate to ward-off the risk of deflation. In light of that decision we began charging clients for euro deposits on December 1st. However, now that lower oil prices have increased the risk of deflation, the ECB has finally responded with the full scale quantitative easing of a scale similar to that seen in the U.S. and the UK. The Bank of Canada reduces its administered rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday citing the impact of low oil prices on its economy and the outlook translation. The loonie dropped in reaction to this surprise move. The bigger surprise was the Swiss national banks last week. With their removal of the cap on the Swiss Franc and increased the negative rate being charged for deposits. Our FX business was not impacted adversely by the dramatic move in the Swiss Franc post the announcement. And all of our businesses have been working with clients as they manage the impact of this market disruption.  While our deposit basis Swiss Franc is much lower than it is for other major currencies, we do plan to communicate with clients that deposit pricing may have to be adjusted for Swiss Franc deposits. The Fed by the forecast of the FOMC members themselves at the December meeting is still projecting a tightening a monetary policy in 2015. Nevertheless, rapidly fall in U.S. inflation is creating a good deal of market uncertainty as to whether such hikes will actually materialize and has contributed too much lower U.S. long-term yield. These lower yields have resulted in the significant increase in mortgage applications in the U.S. which could result in a spike in mortgage prepayment as homeowners refinance to take advantage of low long-term yields. Monetary policy is still projected to diverge in 2015 across the G7, but that's now predicated more on continued easing in the Eurozone and Japan. Together these economic divergences and uncertainties have resulted in a greater fragility in financial market trends in the fourth quarter of 2014 and into the beginning of 2015.  Together, these trends impact our business lines in several ways including, first, global growth downgrades and disinflation risks means the low interest rate environment could be protracted. This continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as high yielding investments mature pay down were experienced prepayment and then those funds are reinvested at low yielding investments currently available in the market. We also continue to experience high levels of deposits. And for liquidity reasons maintained those as we view as access with central bank. However, in Europe, after we began to charge negative rates on certain euro deposits, we saw euro deposits run off by an average of US $5 billion from September 30, 2014. Second, the uncertainties around certain global economies have caused some flows out of emerging markets towards the end of the fourth quarter. Emerging market flows would adversely impact our servicing fees. This was offset by continued volatility and elevated volume and foreign exchange markets in the fourth quarter, which positively impacts us our trading servicing revenue.  And finally, reduced values in securities market especially equities and the strength in the U.S. dollar have a direct impact on our investment servicing and asset management businesses. Later in this call, we'll be walking you through our 2015 outlook and our assumptions around equity market and foreign exchange rate. Our 2015 revenue while look assumes stronger global equity market valuation. And for the U.S. dollar do not strengthening any further than it already has in 2015.  Now, I'd like to talk about the growth in our asset servicing and asset management business. Our 2014 new asset servicing wins total over $1.1 trillion including approximately $400 billion in the fourth quarter, representing broad participation globally as well as across multiple sectors. 37% of the assets for 2015 were from outside the U.S. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future period, totaled $406 billion at yearend and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines.  In our asset management business, we experienced net inflows of $7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014. The flows were driven by net inflows of $36 billion into EPS, offset by net outflows of $9 billion in cash funds and $20 billion from institutional funds which was driven primarily led by rebalancing by a client based in Asia Pacific out of fixed income. Our success in new business commitments across our franchise reflects our efforts to develop client focused solutions through continuous innovation. Given our client focus and ability to differentiate our offering, we expect to build on a new business momentum for 2015 and beyond. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the quarter as well as our outlook for 20145. Mike? Mike Bell : Thank you, Jay. And good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to comment on two non-operating charges included in our fourth quarter GAAP basis results. First, we recorded an after- tax charge of $40 million, or $0.10 a share, to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. This charge pertains to indirect FX matters that we disclosed over the past few years, and it reflects our intention to seek resolve some but not all of the outstanding and potential claims arising out of our indirect FX activities. Our current efforts even if successful, will not address all of our potential material legal exposure arising out of these activities. As I am sure you can appreciate settlement discussions are confidential, and we are not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this point.  Second, we record an after-tax charge of $27 million, or $0.06 a share in restructuring cost related to the completion of the Business Ops and IT Transformation program, which we completed this quarter as planned. Overall, we are pleased with the success of this program. Now please turn to Page 9 of the slide presentation, I will provide a brief overview of full year and fourth quarter 2014 operating basis results. Full year 2014 EPS increased over 12% from the prior year, driven by strong fee revenue growth and the continued execution of our common stock repurchase program. Full year 2014 total fee growth of 7.4% offset a persistent low interest rate environment which negatively impacted net interest revenue. For full year 2014, in the face of increasing and significant regulatory compliance cost, we achieved slightly positive operating leverage. 2014 ROE of 10.9% increased from 10.3% in 2013. Turning to 4Q, '14 results. EPS increased 19% from 4Q, '13, driven by strong fee revenue growth and improved tax rate and a reduction in the number of outstanding shares, partially offset by lower net interest revenue and higher expenses. 4Q, '14 operating basis effective tax rate of 28.5% decreased from a year ago and from third quarter 2014. Our 4Q, 2014 ROE of 11.6% increased from both fourth quarter of 2013 and third quarter of 2014.  Now turn to Slide 12. I'll provide additional details on our operating basis revenue 4Q, '14 and notable variances to 4Q, '13 and 3Q, '14. There were notable items in 4Q, '14. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, negatively affected our fee revenue by $37 million when compared to third quarter of '14. In addition, processing fees and other revenue benefited from incremental equity earnings from joint ventures of $11 million, and net interest revenue included the benefit of one time accelerated loan prepayment of $9 million. Importantly, fee revenue increased 10.6% from 4Q, '13 driven by growth in all fee lines. Servicing fees were up from 4Q, '13 primarily due to net new business and stronger U.S. equity market, partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Servicing fees in 4Q, '14 were down slightly from 3Q, '14 due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar which negatively impacted servicing fees by $15 million. The currency impact was mostly offset by net new business and higher transaction driven revenue. Asset management fees in 4Q, '14 increased from 4Q, '13 primarily due to net new business and stronger U.S. equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Compared to 3Q, '14, management fees decreased primarily due to a $5 million impact from the stronger U.S. dollar, lower performance fees and weaker global equity markets. Total trading service revenue in 4Q,'14 increased 24% compared to the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased foreign exchange revenue driven by higher volatility and volumes.  Securities finance revenue increased approximately 40% compared to 4Q, '13 due to higher spreads and volumes and new business and enhanced custody.  Processing fees and other revenue also increased approximately 40% from 4Q, '13 primarily due to higher equity earnings from joint ventures, and increased revenue associated with tax advantaged investments. Net interest revenue decreased from 4Q, '13 and excluding the one time repayment noted on slide 12, the net interest revenue was approximately flat with 4Q, '13 primarily to due lower yields offset by higher interest earnings assets.  Now many of you have had questions regarding the impact of charging negative rates of fees on euro deposit balances. In December, we began to charge negative rates on certain euro balances. The primary impact of our action has been a decrease of approximately $5 billion in U.S. dollar equivalent of average euro deposits in fourth quarter relative to 3Q, '14. Moving to Slide 13. Let's review 4Q, '14 operating basis expense. As you can see on the top of the slide there were some notable expense items affecting 4Q, '14 results. The stronger U.S. dollar benefited 4Q, '14 expenses by $33 million when compared to 3Q,'14. This was more than offset by a combination of elevated securities processing cost of $29 million, and $17 million charge related to our withdrawal from the over the counter derivatives clearing and execution activities. In addition, we recorded a $9 million impairment primarily associated with an intangible asset.  4Q, '14 compensation and employee benefit expenses of $962 million, increased from 4Q, '13 primarily due to increased cost to support new business and regulatory compliance initiatives as well as higher incentive comp expense partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.  Information systems and communication expenses increased from a year ago. 4Q, '14 information systems and communication expenses included $6 million related to our withdrawal from the over the counter derivatives, clearing and execution activities. Transaction processing expenses were higher than 4Q, '13 primarily due to higher servicing volumes. Occupancy expenses decreased 4Q, '13 primarily due to the effect of an $8 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013 associated with the sublease renegotiation. Compared to 4Q of 2013, other expenses increased primarily due to higher professional services, primarily related to regulatory compliances initiatives. Cost associated with our withdrawal from the over the counter derivatives, clearing and execution activities in the fourth quarter of 2014. $9 million impairment primarily associated with an intangible asset and $28 million of Lehman Brothers - related gains recoveries recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Compared to 3Q, '14, other expenses increased primarily due to higher securities processing cost, higher professional service fees primarily related to regulatory compliance initiatives, cost associated with our withdrawal from over the counter derivatives, clearing and execution activities in fourth quarter of 2014. And impairment primarily associated with an intangible asset. Now I'll provide a brief overview our December 31, 2014 balance sheet on Slide 14. Our balance sheet continues to evolve as we respond to regulatory changes including the liquidity rules. Our estimated liquidity coverage ratio is above a 100% as of yearend of 2014. The investment portfolio maintained a high credit quality profile and our duration was in line with the prior quarter.  Lastly, the after-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of December 31, 2014 was $487 million, which improve from September 30, primarily due to the decline in interest rate partially offset by wider credit spreads.  Now turn to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital position is strong. Its strength has enabled us to accomplish a top priority of returning value to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of yearend 2014, our holding company common equity Tier 1 ratio under the current Basel III advanced approach was 12.5%. Under the Basel III standardize approach, which will go into effect in reporting period beginning in 2015; our holding company estimated pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratio was approximately 10.8%. Under the fully phased in advanced and standardized approaches, our estimated pro forma common equity Tier 1 ratios were approximately 11.6% and 10% respectively.  We estimate that our supplementary leveraged ratios under our interpretation of the final U.S. rules are approximately 5.7% of the holding company and approximately 5.1% of the bank as of yearend 2014. Based on our estimate of the pro forma fully phased in supplementary leverage ratios as of yearend 2014, they were approximately 5.2% for the holding company and approximately 4.8% for the bank. We are comfortable we have the levers that will enable us to be in compliance with requirements in advanced of the 2018 effective date.  On December 9, the Federal Reserve released a notice of proposed rule making to establish capital surcharges for U.S. globally systematically important banks. Our prior proposed surcharge of 1% may increase under the Federal Reserve proposal to 1.5%. This will depend upon the final rules particularly the treatment of non operational deposits. Returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top priority. During 4Q, '14, we repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of approximately $410 million, resulting in average fully diluted common shares outstanding of approximately $424 million this quarter. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $470 million remaining on our current common stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchases up to $1.7 billion of our common stock through March 31, 2015. So to summarize, our 2014 operating basis financial performance, we are pleased with the fee revenue growth of 7.4% and proud of our EPS growth of 12%.  Now let's turn to our outlook for 2015 on Slide 17 through 20. We plan to continue to focus on key priorities of delivering value added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. Beginning with revenue outlook, we currently expect total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014 as shown on slide 17. Our fee growth expectations are depended upon a number of assumptions including those for equity markets and foreign exchange rates which are summarized on slide 17. I would note that we project that the stronger U.S. dollar would reduce operating basis to 2015 fee revenue by approximately $200 million assuming constant currency rate relative to 2014. This $200 million headwind is built in to our 4% to 7% operating basis fee growth forecast.  We further expect that the stronger U.S. dollar would provide an operating basis expense benefit that is only modestly less than the detriment to fee revenue, using the same constant currency rate assumptions relative to 2014. As a result, we believe we largely have a natural currency hedge relative to fee revenue. We expect our operating basis tax rate to increase to 30% to 32% in 2015 as compared to 29% in 2014, due both to the non recurrence of certain tax savings realized in 2014 and to an increase in state and local taxes.  Slide 18, summarizes two scenarios for our 2015 net interest revenue, which we expect to be pressured in 2015 from the persistent low interest rate environment and reinvestment of the investment portfolio in the high quality liquid assets to meet the new liquidity requirements. The first scenario assumes interest rate remain static with 2014 yearend levels. Under this scenario, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2015 to be in the range of $2.07 billion to $2.17 billion. The second scenario assumes administered interest rate will increase in 25 basis point increment per quarter beginning in August of 2015 for the UK, and a single increase in December for the U.S. Under this scenario, we expect short - term market interest rate to increase and advance of the increase in administered rate. We estimate that operating basis 2015 net interest revenue in this scenario to be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion. Since there is significant uncertainty to the amount and timing of interest rate increase, we believe both of these scenarios are relevant to consider. Now moving to Slide 19. Expense management remains a priority; while there continues to be upward pressure on regulatory compliance costs, our focus in 2015 will be on prudently managing expenses and driving further efficiencies, expanding our capabilities to meet increasing regulatory expectations, supporting new business growth, including higher information technology costs and continuing to fund growth initiatives. In this context and based on our current assumptions noted on the slide, we are targeting for our operating-basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating-basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. I'd note that this assumes that we achieve our operating basis total fee revenue growth objective of 4% to 7% in 2015. Although positive operating leverage remains a long-term goal; our near-term ability to achieve is likely predicated on higher market interest rates for a significant portion of 2015. An additional point that is important to note is in prior years the first quarter of 2015 compensation and employee benefits expense will be higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement -eligible employees as well as for payroll taxes. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement-eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2015 to be in the range of approximately $140 million to $150 million, this compares to $146 million in first quarter of 2014. Now turning to Slide 20, I'd note that returning capital to shareholders remains a higher priority. We issued $750 million of preferred shares in 4Q, '14 bringing our total preferred outstanding to approximately $2 billion. Based upon preferred shares currently outstanding, we expect total preferred dividend cost to be approximately $31 million in first quarter of 2015, and $118 million for the full year 2015. Finally, the evolution of our balance sheet and of regulatory capital and liquidity expectations may lead to additional issuances of preferred shares of approximately $750 million in 2015. We may also issue additional long-term debt.  And with that, I'll turn the call back to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks Mike. Stephanie, we are now open to responding call. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. Mike, in your fee revenue growth outlook I just wanted to ask you to kind of flesh out more; are you expecting -- which business do you expect to drive the incremental growth? And what is the real delta between the bottom and the top end as far as what goes poorly or what goes better at the low and high end? Mike Bell : Ken, sure, in terms of the 4% to 7% our fee revenue growth that we expect in 2015 versus 2014. First, I'll just repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, Ken that does include a $200 million headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. So that is built into the 4% to 7%, otherwise would be roughly 2.5 points higher than 4% to 7% range. So on a constant currency basis think of it as you call it 6.5% to 9.5% but we think again the U.S. dollar shrinking is a real headwind. In terms of what we expect to drive that, I'd really characterize it as continued strength in each of our main fee revenue categories for 2015. And specifically we are pleased with the net new business that we got in particularly in our global services business, we would expect that to continue and actually increase in 2015 relatively to what we saw in 2014. We expect continued growth in our management fees. And we are pleased with the uptick in the Sec [ph] finance revenue in Q4 and also the FX revenue in Q4. And while I wouldn't characterize as the new run rate going forward, I do think on a full year basis 2015 to 2014, we will continue to see good growth in both of those businesses. Lastly to your question on the magnitude of the range and how to think about it. I think, Ken, the major wild cards to me, number one would be again the market driven revenues. FX volatility -- pardon the pun, but FX volatility was quite volatile throughout 2014 and I think it's anybody's guess. So I'd characterize the low end of the range as being a returned or weaker volatility than what we saw in the second half of the year. Sec [ph] finance will please with the strengthening in those revenues in the second half of the year. M&A environment help with that. The enhanced custody revenue continues to be strong, that was helpful. But again we saw in the first half of the year, sec [ph] lending on the agency side, seeing very narrow spreads and certainly that could revert. Lastly, there is an overall question of client flows. We benefited in 2014 as Jay has talked about several times. We've benefited from strong flows in 2014. I'd characterize the upper end of that range is being continued strength there and the lower end a possibly some softening there. Let me see if Jay wants to add or add to those comments. Jay Hooley : Yes. The only thing I'd probably pile on, Ken, would be that I noted that we have $406 billion and committed yet to be installed pipeline in the asset servicing business. And I'd say broadly the pipeline they are as good as they looked in several quarters. So I'd add that to the input. Ken Usdin : Okay. My second question on capital, you mentioned the extra $750 million potential. Basel III Tier 1 common has also kind of dripped back down to 10 [ph], so can you talk to us about what drives the decision tree on the potential to issue that extra $750 million? And also if any of that also informs any differing view on how you think about your capital return ask? Mike Bell : Sure, Ken. It is my -- first on the pref, the main couple things driving the likelihood of the additional pref issuance in 2015 would be number one, additional clarity that at least for the foreseeable future. The SLR particularly the 6% SLR at the bank is likely to be our binding constraint. Again, I would characterize that is likely to be our binding constraint for a while. And therefore it is more economical to meet that binding constraint with pref as opposed to common just given the relative cost to capital of common versus call it 6% for -- and after tax basis for after pref, so that's number one. Number two, we've seen an increase in deposit levels particularly non operational deposits throughout 2014. Again with that occurring in 2014, we view it as more economical to meet the required capital associated with that deposit growth with pref as opposed to common. Is it relates to the risk based ratios, since we turn around and place excess deposit with the central banks that does not increase our risk weighted assets and therefore that does not had an impact on the risk based ratios, and therefore I'd again just reinforce that we think the SLR is likely going to be the binding constraint for a while. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Great. Good morning, guys. So my question on the operating leverages. I guess in the outlook slide you guys have kind of outlined core fee growth versus core expenses, which I think your competitors are kind of migrating towards that sort of metric as well. But when we think about the operating leverage for the entire enterprise, from your comments it sounds like unless rates go up in the middle of the year it is unlikely that you guys will achieve material operating leverage in 2015. So I just want to make sure I understand that. And then I have a follow-up. Jay Hooley : Yes, Alex, I would say that what we shared with you at your encouragement is our best thinking as we sit here today around 2015 outlook. And when you look at some of my comments what shifted in the last 90 days with regard to the general economic outlook and the likelihood that maybe the Fed delays tightening, we want to put out there they are two different scenarios. And Mike can comment at it if he like. We set every year as a goal operating leverage. We will continue to do that. And we will strive to achieve that. What we are signaling is that if in fact a rate stays stagnant, it is going to put a lot of pressure on our ability to achieve operating leverage. So -- Mike, you want to say -- Mike Bell : Yes. Alex, the only thing I would add. I think there is arguably more uncertainty around the NIR outlook for full year 2015 than there has been for a quite while. I mean it's not loss on any of us just how soft a situation is in Europe. And while we are encouraged by number of the public comments coming out of the Fed on the possibility of increases in administrative rates in the U.S. Just given that relative divergence, we thought it made more sense to put out the two different scenarios. And that way again depending upon on your own view of the world you can model it the way you see fit. Second, I'd just emphasis, Alex that obviously the piece that we can control the most is our expense growth relative to our fee revenue growth. And we feel like that's going to be a good story for 2015. As we talked about we expect to get at least 200 basis point delta between our fee revenue growth and our overall expense growth for 2015. And that's the piece that we feel like we have the most control over. So in terms of the fundamentals on what we have the most control over, we feel good about the outlook. Obviously, we are recognizing uncertainty on the NIR. Alexander Blostein : Got it. That is helpful way to doing it. Second question just on FX, and thank you guys for the comments around just this activity on the revenues front, but as you pointed out, there is obviously an offset around expenses. So, yes, it is a big $200 million of drag on fees, but you guys should get some help from expenses. Can you help us understand, when we think again about the enterprise as a whole from a pretax earnings or a net income perspective, what is the sensitivity of State Street's model today relative to -- in an environment where the US dollar continues to strengthen? If euro/dollar goes to parity, what is the pre-tax hit that we should think, or is it not a very meaningful number because of that natural hedge in the model? Mike Bell : Yes, Alex, it is Mike. The shorting answer is it is not a material and the grand scheme of State Street impact on our overall EPS. I mean there is modest impact of course because the fee revenue is slightly impacted more than the overall expense level. There is also some collateral impact on our net interest revenue. But again in the grand scheme of things, that's not the risk that I'd point out is being the top five or top ten list. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Thanks. I appreciate the rising rate scenario and obviously when you compare it to the static it doesn't have a huge impact because of the timing of your rate hikes. If you follow on the forward curve, even if it is just ballpark, can you talk about maybe a full-year type impact? Like I f2016 what kind of delta could we be looking at on an operating basis NIR? Mike Bell : Sure, Glenn, it's Mike. First as you can imagine there will be a lot of different factors that would impact 2016. So I would characterize my comments as a directional as opposed to precise. But I think it is -- I think your comment is fair one which since the rising interest rate scenario mainly gives us the benefit in the second half of the year. You could think of the delta between the static and the rising interest rate scenario is being roughly twice that delta in 2016 versus 2015. Now, again importantly there are so many different factors that would go into 2016. I mean what are -- where our deposit levels, how is the evolution of liquidity expectations taken place, the possible divergence between Europe and the U.S., so I mean there are 100 different caveats I could give you there. But I think you are thinking about in the right ballpark is kind of half the year impact in 2015 and that would then widen obviously with a even greater impact in 2016. Glenn Schorr : Yes. I appreciate that. I'm trying to balance that all with the increased debt issuance, too. Okay. The question specifically on regulatory cost, because you noted there continues to be upward pressures there. I am curious on what is driving that, and I am reading into that line that it says the dollars would be up in 2015 from 2014 which was up from 2013. I want to make sure I'm reading that right. And just, literally, what drives it, what is left to do? Mike Bell : Sure, Glenn. First of all you are reading it right. We do expect 2015 regulatory cost to be higher than 2014 and 2014 was certainly higher than 2013. I would not point, Glenn, to a single area and say it is this area that's driving the higher regulatory cost. It really is the culmination of ratcheting expectations by regulators really across the globe on a higher expectation particularly for GSIBs in terms of regulatory compliance. And in many cases it is not just literal compliance with a literal rules. It is all of qualitative aspects of our management processes that end up getting evaluated by the various exams and various standards that were subject to. Let me see if Jay wants to add anything. Jay Hooley : Yes. The only thing I would add I agree with that, Glenn. The only I add is that if you look at any one of these processes so take CCAR for instance, 2013 versus 2014 submission significant increase in our expectation. And the point I was going to add is that knowing or believing that this is a long-term gain, part of the investment that's going into this is to structurally change the way we are aggregating data so that not unlike our IT and Op Transformation program, we are looking at long -term regulation and compliance, need to be best in class, it must stand point of the results that we deliver but the way we collect data and deliver that information. So there is a pretty high effort going into creating internal data model so that we can quickly aggregate and bring together information not only for today's expectations but for tomorrows as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning, guys. So when you look at the NIR delta between the static and rising rate scenario that you painted, can you help us just bifurcate the upside there between the rise in the UK? Was it the US rates just given that they are happening at different times? Jay Hooley : Sure, Ashley, it's Mike. We would anticipate that the rise in the Bank of England rates and the associated market increase -- market interest rate increase in interest rates from that would be round numbers worth about $20 million to $25 million US in full year 2015 versus full year 2014. And the way you might want to think about that is, think about it is we have approximately $12 billion of US dollar equivalent deposits in the UK, and we beginning a little more than half a year in terms of the impact on market interest rates and the basis point increase would be a little more than 25 because we get a little bit of an additional benefit from the second 25 increase. So that's the background of the arithmetic behind that number. And then the Fed fund increase would be approximately the remainders. So think of it is again round numbers, Ashley, of approximately $60 million of benefit from market interest rates rising modestly in advance of that Fed fund increase. Ashley Serrao : Okay. Appreciate you guys having just a lot of challenges out there from the regulatory environment and environmental as well. Should this environment persist or deteriorate further is there anything else that you could do on the expense side to help mitigate the situation? Jay Hooley : Yes, I would say, this is Jay, Ashley; I would say two things because we think the regulatory requirements will continue to grow. So the two things that we are consciously doing, one, I already mentioned which is to replace the labor with technology like we would in any of our operating businesses, and do better job at gathering information. And the second which we did in 2014, we will continue to do in 2015 is to replace external consultant dollars which come at a premium with internal staff. We are also doing some of these work in lower cost environment so all of the techniques should expect to do the work at a high level but do it more sufficiently, we are putting into place with regard to all of the regulatory initiatives. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : Good morning, thanks. So in your guidance you are forecasting the EUR1.16 to US dollar by the year end of 2015. I think we are already at EUR1.12 and possibly headed lower. So perhaps you could discuss how important that exchange rate assumption is to your NIR guidance, and then whether today's exchange rate would represent a material change in that expectation. I think I heard you downplay the risk factor in a prior response, but maybe you could be a little bit more explicit. Mike Bell : Sure, Luke, it is Mike. First of all, rule of thumb that I use around the euros specifically is it a 1% swing in the euro relative to the US dollar is worth approximately $10 million of annual fee revenue and a shade less than that. So call it $9.5 million of impact on full year expenses. And that's for the entire State Street enterprise. The NIR impact would be a fraction of that. So as I said, there are some very, very modest headwinds associated with the euro continuing to weaken on NIR but that is built into the range that I provided in the prepared remarks. Luke Montgomery : Okay, helpful, thanks. And then I wonder if you guys could talk us through the decision to shut down the swaps clearing business. I think the plan is to focus on futures clearing, although I think some would argue that you really don't have scale there either and you lost Pimco, which was your biggest client. So how are you gauging your prospects in the futures business? And then if you could speak to how these developments affect your ability or your appetite to offer collateral management and collateral transformation. Jay Hooley : Sure, Luke. Let me take that and this is Jay. You are right in that I think we began this journey thinking that both OTC and futures clearing are both attractive, inter opportunities given the clearing requirement that were imposed by regulators. As it turns out what we are hearing from our customers is there is more of calling for future's clearing versus over the counter clearing, so we had taken a first steps in that journey and concluded that we were better serve to follow the futures clearing path. We think we have a very competitive offering. We've got good volumes through our futures clearing merchant, and we are optimistic that's a good additional product for us going forward. With regard to collateral management. We've spoken before we think that's nice additional service. I don't see it as having huge upside revenue potential but the need to optimize and manage collateral is ever present in the activities that we conduct for our customers. So we have the series of collateral management services that we offer to our customers and get good take up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, good morning, thanks. Just in looking at the 2015 outlook, if I am getting this right, if we look at the middle of that fee range, so call it 5.5% growth and assume about 3.5% growth in operating expenses. If we take the static NIR range and then considering the tax rate and obviously share buyback, to me that comes to around a flattish EPS result for 2015 using those assumptions. Just wanted to check if I'm doing that right by your math. Mike Bell : Yes, Brian, I mean roundly -- there is obviously there are number of different assumptions built in there. I think roundly your arithmetic is in the ballpark, I think importantly number one, we do believe we are going to achieve at least 200 basis points of daylight between fee growth and the expense growth and again you took obviously the 200 basis points and we think there is a reasonable chance to get some help from market interests and obviously you took the static interest rate scenario. So I am not disagreeing with your arithmetic. But the -- just recognize the implicit judgments that you are making there. Brian Bedell : Yes, so some upside if those are a little better, okay. Then just clarification. I think I missed the revenue impact on the fee line that you cited, Mike. And then were there any fees from euro deposit charges or any bank charges that you passed along baked into the servicing fees and or do you expect those charges to come to the servicing fees in 2015 or through NIR? Mike Bell : Sure. So, Brian, in terms of the impact of the stronger US dollar, what I said in my prepared remarks is that the currency assumptions noted on the slide would negatively impact fee revenue in 2015 full year by approximately $200 million. That would be almost entirely offset by a same kind of reduction on the expenses. So that it would have a relatively immaterial impact on overall earnings for the full year. But think of it is, again 10% shrinking in the US dollar costing us $200 billion of reported fee revenue growth for the full year. In terms of the negative interest rates in Europe, we did collect some small approximately US $3 million in Q4 from the negative interest rates that we are charging on euro deposits in Q4. We have assumed that, that will continue at least at that level into full year 2015 reflecting the fact that the ECB rate obviously is negative, the Swiss bank rate is now even more negative and so again we are making the assumption that we will continue to charge for euro deposits as long as that situation is evident. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, guys. So I understand that the rules are preliminary and somewhat fluid, but at this point do you have an estimate for what proportion of your deposit base would be considered non-operating? Mike Bell : At this point, you are absolutely right. It is a fluid situation, Brenn, we do estimate that our excess deposits on average for Q4, 2014 were $52 billion, but as you correctly noted the ultimate calculation, the ultimate standards that are used to determine exactly what's an operational deposit versus a non operational deposit, that work is still in progress. Brennan Hawken : But for right now you feel confident that the way you view excess is in line with your understanding of the non-operating definition? Mike Bell : That's correct. Brennan Hawken : Cool. Okay, thanks. And just want to follow up on what Alex and Ashley both hit on. It is certainly helpful to hear that you might moderate regulatory expenses with tech and such, but the environment -- it is certainly nothing new that the environment has been difficult and it has been brutal for like five years for pretty much all financial services firms. So it is not like it is episodic to State Street, but it seems like the message is that you all are waiting for it to get better rather than proactively dealing with it. And I guess I hear that frustration from investors. I am curious how you would counter that and what will it take for you guys to start to get maybe a bit more proactive on managing the expense front; not just for the regulatory pressures, but also for the environmental ones. Jay Hooley : I would say on a regulatory one, I think we are doing, I think we are being proactive. And proactive means not just responding to the need but looking at over the horizon to see what's coming next to making sure we can hardened an infrastructure to do this more efficiently than anyone else going forward. And I don't have perfect visibility to what others are doing but we are taking a longer view of this. And building sustainable infrastructure but very proactive. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And maybe on the environmental front, what do you guys think there? I get it that it is really difficult and it is hard to try to figure out how long this is going to last, but is there a point at which we start seeing you maybe take some hacks at the expense base or start to tactically start to think about how you want to reposition the business? Jay Hooley : Yes. Let me -- the environmental front, just to make sure we get the -- we are talking about the same environment. I think we've been, we've talked a lot about the rate environment and its effect on net interest revenue. We try to give you the little bit of the book and thinking on possible outcomes for 2015. We commented on 2016 as well. Environmentally given this divergence of macro economic trends, actually that's a little bit more positive for the market driven revenues and you saw some of that in the fourth quarter and our expectation for 2015 is that continues to get better. With regard to expenses, as we mentioned the IT and Ops Transformation program wound down as we concluded 2014, but we have several efforts underway which pick up on the core themes of IT and Ops Transformation and that is to increasingly drive efficiencies through operational processes, through doing work in lower cost environment. And Mike referenced some investment in technology. We continue to employ technology to replace human labor. So even though the program officially ended in 2014, our jest to continue to get more efficient has not subsided. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, two follow-ups from prior questions. One, Mike, I guess you just kind of gave it to us straight, so if EPS is flat in a static scenario would that imply something closer to $5.10? Mike Bell : Mike, first of all, I would just emphasize that the -- there are number of different factors that are going to impact EPS not just the net interest revenue and not just the market interest rate. I would simply making the comment that the arithmetic that we were talking about earlier did take the conservative end of a handful of different assumptions. So flat EPS year-over-year would certainly not be by best estimate although I would respect you, Mike, if you pick your own views on both interest rates as well as how much we are going to exceed expense growth with fee revenue growth in 2015. Mike Mayo : So I guess slide 18 the main point is that lower rates for a lot longer really hurt your NIR and there is not a whole lot you can do about that, so --? Mike Bell : Well, I mean certainly that's the case, Mike. And we did talk about that in detail at our Investor Day a year ago. And I am sure we will be talking about it at the upcoming Investor Day. We talked about if interest rate stayed static that we would expect the net interest margin to continue to grind down, a fair amount lower versus where it is today, all of those numbers if you recall excluded excess deposits which have grown -- it is a little different issue. But in terms of what would we do in that kind of environment. Number one is as we talked about this morning, we will look --we will continue to look for even more efficiency opportunities including as Jay talked about earlier, looking for opportunities to use IT to replace labor on a number of different fronts. We think that's good for clients and then good for our shareholders. And then ultimately if we really believe that interest rates would stay at this level forever particularly given the capital and liquidity rules, we have to over time look more holistically at pricing. And ensure that our client relationships in totality in that kind of environment are enabling add a quick return for our shareholders. Mike Mayo : So the idea of the capital for labor swap, Jay, you've spoken about the movement to the digital enterprise. Can you talk about this next phase of State Street and the investments that you are making and when you can potentially see some of those payoffs, since that would seem to help out expenses over the medium to long term? Jay Hooley : Yes, happy to, Mike, and when we do have going internally to digital enterprise as a broad based organizational effort to digitize our environment which is I think going to be critical not only to drive efficiency but if I think about some of our most attractive perspective future product sales, most likely revolve around our ability to aggregate real time information for our customers for risk management and another services. So I would put us in a little bit of transitional period between IT and Ops Transformation and the digital enterprise. And in 2014 and a little bit in 2015, one of the critical elements to getting there being more reliant on technology is to make sure we complete hardened our technology environment, internally we use the word building resilient so that it is practically impossible for our technology to go down. Once we are more of reliant on technology less on labor, you can't have technology that fails where if you have higher labor content, it is ability to recover, so we are investing in that infrastructure, but as we get there, every process within the organization is getting examined for how we can improve the process itself. And then how we can apply technology to replace labor. And I would say that, Mike, that's not just for the operational area. If you look at the finance area or just an example on our support group, that organization is going through that same thing. So we don't know what the future hold, we don't know when rates will start to rise, but we are not waiting for that. We are anticipating that it is going to be a slow environment for some years to come. And therefore we are driving efficiencies in every corner of the place. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty with BofA Merrill Lynch. Adam Beatty : Good morning. I have two questions about asset management, so I guess I will ask them both at once. The first concerns the fixed income rebalancing that you saw in Asia and just I guess in one sense it's a positive data point for rate rises, but just what you are seeing across the complex. Do you anticipate or see in smaller fashion similar types of activity? And also and maybe more importantly, globally do you see different investor behavior across regions, maybe based on some of the currency volatility? The other question I had was about more specifically about ETFs -- I see impressive asset growth there -- and where you see opportunities there, particularly maybe in the retirement space and 401(k) platforms. Thank you. Jay Hooley : Sure. Bunch of questions there, Adam. Let me take a swing at it. You saw -- I gave you a breakdown of our net $7 billon and net new assets under management and highlighted a $20 billion fixed income, client that laughed I would say that was certainly one off and we would hope as the client rebalances to pick up something on the equity side in time but there is little transition going on there. If you look at our asset management business, it is anchored in the passive/beta, smart beta space not exclusively but primarily and delivered through various vehicles, you mentioned ETF. When we look at where flows are coming from these days. I think beyond SSGA [ph] you see broadly a broad move into scientific or actively managed funds. Not just passive but active or passive with an active bend on it, some call it smart data, that's the term that we use. We see that as a worldwide phenomenon. It is happening everywhere. It is delivered through various vehicles. We think ETF is a preferred vehicle given a natural efficiency both tax and otherwise if delivering diversified investment. So we've made a considerable effort into expanding our ETF business not just from the standpoint of product, which we do by ourselves and I think we are the only large ETF provider that engages other managers, Blackstone, the DoubleLine, and MFS in an active equity sub advisory relationship. But we've also built out since as you probably know ETFs are largely bought through intermediaries, we built out our wholesaling force in the US and increasingly in Europe on the continent. So I would say both passive and alternatives are two big themes that we see globally. And on the alternative side well as an asset manager we don't play that. We are active, they should expect on the asset servicing side for servicing passive both hedge private equity and real estate. Last point I would make which is more of a servicing comment but it brings an interesting side light, is that in the US but trending across the globe these mutual funds that take on alternative element to them, with not only service those but that has been big source of our enhanced custody growth. So I would say broadly passive and alternative and ETF is the preferred vehicle for distribution. Adam Beatty : So it sounds like some real synergy between the asset management and the custody? Jay Hooley : Absolutely. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wharton with JPMorgan. Steven Wharton : Hi, guys. I just had a question on the rate outlook. You are actually, in some ways to me, somewhat conservative. I recognize that the forward curve expectations have shifted outwards, so you have this first Fed rate rise starting in December. But I was just kind of wondering if the Fed has indicated, which I know could change, that they may move as soon as this summer. The dot plot keeps moving around of course. But if, for example, the Fed moved say sometime in June or July or even in August or September and you ended the year closer to maybe 50 or 75 basis points on the Fed funds rate, can you give me a sense of the benefit that might accrue to the NII forecast and the rising rate scenario? Mike Bell : Sure. Steven, it is Mike. I appreciate you are right, your comments and I think importantly the answer to your question would be predicated on how quickly do we see the benefit of the market expecting that sooner Fed fund administer great hike, how quickly do we see that show up for example in one month and three month LIBOR. So it is caveated on that. Historically, we've seen one month and three month LIBOR increase in advance of the administered great as the market starts to price that in. But that's really the heavy dependency. I would characterize it is as round numbers, think of it as approximately $60 million of potential benefit in 2015. If in fact we got a mid year kind of increase rather than the December that we had expected, again as long as-- I mean that would really suggest that we would be seeing probably as early as March or certainly by April, the increase in the LIBOR rate. So that's the dependency. Steven Wharton : So the $60 million would be -- is that per 25 basis points or is that in aggregate? Mike Bell : Well, I was just trying to answer your question in aggregate which I heard it as if we would get in the first Fed fund increase at mid year then we get a second increase in Q4, what do I think the overall impact would that be on NIR for full year 2015 relative to the expectations that we share with you on the slide. Steven Wharton : Okay. So that basically implies roughly two rates rise with a little bit of market rate impact ahead of it? Mike Bell : Correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, thanks. I had a quick question on the potential long-term debt issuance in 2015. Looking right now you have about $10 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet and I am assuming that is being done in preparation for TLAC or NSFR. Can you give us a sense of how much that could grow? Are you looking at it as a percentage of RWA, or how much are you going to add potentially in 2015? Mike Bell : Sure, Brian. It's Mike. Yes, there is uncertainty around where TLAC is going specifically what kind of proposed rule will the Fed issue around TLAC. And that was really the main driver of the comment that I was making. So at this point I would not try to size it. Obviously, as we know more we will communicate more -- at this point I wouldn't try to size the potential issue and some long-term debt size, I just think there are too many uncertainties in terms of where those rules are ultimately going to go. Brian Kleinhanzl : You mean that you won't issue until you see the rules; is that the way to interpret that? Mike Bell : Well, I just think there are number of difference considerations on whether we would issue or not in 2015, not the least that which would market condition, so I'd rather not try to give you a specific forecast on long-term debt. But I was acknowledging the point that you made which is accurate that if TLAC came out from the Fed and particularly if it was more conservative than then Basel rule that might encourage us to do more rather less in 2015. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Then just my second question was on the preferred issuance. It sounded like there was some optionality in that as well, meaning it is not included within your CCAR plans so you are not required to issue it. So is there a scenario where you could see yourself not having to issue preferred? Mike Bell : I'd obviously prefer not to talk about CCAR submission at this point. Is there a scenario that I could imagine where we didn't issue the $750 million of additional preferred? Sure, but I think that it is unlikely. I think it is more likely than not that we will issue the additional $750 million. Again, timing to be determined but I think it is more likely than not. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Mike, can you just help us understand, given that you are assuming a flat rate environment, flat balance sheet, what are the drivers of the $100 million variance in the NII? And then secondarily, if we are assuming a flat rate environment as we have seen over the past couple years, you have had pretty steady strong deposit growth. Is there a reason why we wouldn't or shouldn't assume more deposit growth in 2015 if we have a flat rate environment? Mike Bell : Sure, Jim. First in terms of the NII forecast for 2015, when you talk about the $100 million, you are talking about the difference between 2014 actual and the mid -- Jim Mitchell : Oh, no, I'm sorry. The range between the low end and the high end, sorry. Mike Bell : I understand, thank you. Well, first of all, it actually links to your deposit growth point. It is not lost on us that particularly we've seen substantial deposit growth over the course of 2014. Unfortunately, mainly that has been in the category of excess deposits which means that we've turned around and put that deposit growth with the central banks and earned a very, very small interest margin on that. And so deposit growth would be an example of uncertainty in our forecast for 2015, hence the other wide range. I'd also add to the point that we may see this divergence in 2015 by geography. So that was the thinking that was a part of that that range as well. They will be mixes in the change of -- in our portfolio and again there are just so many different moving parts here, Jim that I thought particularly given that we are so early in the year, that kind of width of range makes sense. And then your question on the deposit growth. Given the pressure that the growth particularly in excess deposits puts on our capital ratios and therefore would potentially put on the need to issue additional pref longer term, I would hope that we would not have and we would expect that we would not have the kind of growth in excess deposits over the course of 2015 that we had over 2014. I think net-net that would be a negative because again even if it evolves those excess deposit came in the US, they get placed with the central bank here currently earnings 25 basis points, that's not helpful economically with today's interest rate environment and with today's capital liquidity rules. Jim Mitchell : No, fair. So just to follow-up on your discussion there, the range is sort of dependent on deposit level. So is the upper end of the range assuming some deposit growth, or you mean it is flat and the low end of the range is assuming some deposit runoff? Mike Bell : Yes, obviously, Jim, there are a lot of different factors that the deposit would be a piece of it. But I just think, again where our spread going to go in 2015, what kind of portfolio opportunities do we have in 2015, how do the rules get and answer to one of the earlier question, I think it was Brennan's that -- where is the final interpretation of the operational deposit rules for LCR come out, there are just a lot of different uncertainties that could push at either or up down. Jim Mitchell : Fair enough. And just one last question just on the prior discussion you have had a couple of times around at the low end that implies flat earnings. Was that discussion, and maybe I missed it, reflecting or contemplating lower share count from the buyback or not, when you think about flat earnings at the low end? Mike Bell : Yes. I'd rather not get into share count and forecast just given that, that would imply certain things about CCAR but I would just simply try to point out that the our view is that we are going to have EPS growth in 2015. We obviously recognized the risk factors and we try to be very transparent about the pluses and minuses. I think most importantly I think the things that we can most control, we feel good about what we are going to execute on for 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. If I think about capital ratios declining a little bit, the GSIB surcharge potentially stepping up from 100 basis points to 150 basis points, then just conceptually how do you think about the right proportion of earnings that you should be returning to shareholders? Not so much thinking about this year, but just going forward, given that there is some growth in the business, how long can you keep giving everything back before you have to start retaining something? Mike Bell : Sure, Geoff, it is Mike. First, I think they are really two different questions embedded in your question there. One is the GSIB buffer. I would emphasize that my comment on it, it potentially increasing is based upon our interpretation of the Fed's proposed rule and in particular that our non operational deposits get picked up on to our interpretation, our non operational deposits get picked up in what they are characterizing as short -term wholesale funding despite the fact that those dollars are literally placed with the central bank which we view as the epitome of a risk free transaction. And we view it as the antithesis of a hot money kind of risk. So GSIB buffer, we will certainly put in the common letter and we would hope that reason would ultimately prevail there. So I think it's way too early to attribute a change in philosophy or anything, a change in game plan related to that. I think your question on-- more importantly which we will talk about some more at our Investor Day in February is our longer-term plans around capital management. And in a nutshell, Geoff, our game plan has not changed there which is that we would expect to return -- if you think about our overall ROE, we would expect to payout a portion of that in common stock dividends, a portion of it would need to be retained to fund a growing balance sheet over time, but that again assuming that we limit the growth in the required capital from a growing balance sheet to small single digit number so that provides ample opportunity over the long haul for share repurchase and using that as a vehicle to return capital to shareholders. Operator : We have time for one final question. Your final question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, guys. You mentioned that with the negative deposit rates at the European Central Bank and other central banks customers are starting to pull out some deposits. Others are paying those fees. Can you guys give us some color on the sensitivity analyses you might be doing; if those numbers become more negative at the central banks, how many more customers may decide to leave rather than paying the fees? And then would you shrink the balance sheet accordingly? And as part of that, I heard in response to some answers about the amount of fees you received in the fourth quarter was $3 million. And I didn't know if that was just for the month of December which, Jay, you mentioned that is when you started to charge and then, Mike, you said that was for the full fourth quarter. So is it a $9 million run rate or is it just $3 million? Jay Hooley : Gerard, let me start that one and Mike can jump in maybe on the $3 million question. It is probably too early to tell as to what the sensitivity, at what price balances find different homes. But as you rightly point out it is -- to me one of the most important elements of what we are doing by charging for euro deposits, is trying to determine or establish at what price deposit stay versus go. And if you carry that forward that would be a pretty powerful weapon for us with regard to having some control is probably a too stronger word but some ability to influence excess deposit which obviously have big consequences for the capital that we hold. So early days, we've only been added for a couple of months but we are spending a lot of time at the individual client level trying to understand deposit behavior, trying to understand what alternatives there are and what point a price causes somebody to move because we think it has pretty important implications far beyond charging for euro deposits. Mike Bell : And, Gerard, it is Mike, just to add on your question on the timing. So we did start charging for deposits in December. So the $3 million all came in December, it was reported in net interest revenue at this point and so again think of it as on approximately $30 billion, 15 basis points on an annual basis, one month worth is the $3 million. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Then as a follow-up question can you give us some color on the loan portfolio? Obviously on an average basis it is almost $18 billion; that is up nicely from the beginning of the year. The color I am interested in, are there any big energy credits in there? Are you part of any syndicates that you have energy exposure in that portfolio? Mike Bell : The short answer is no, Gerard. Operator : I would now like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Stephanie. I'll be brief. Thanks for your attention and questions this morning. Hopefully, we look forward to seeing all of you on February 25 in New York City. We will be in a position to talk a little bit more about our long-term strategy, and I am sure we revisit 2015 outlook as well. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. And you may now disconnect.",

Anthony Ostler : Thank you, Brandy. Good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO Jay Hooley, who\u2019ll speak first, then Mike Bell, our CFO will take you through our first quarter 2015 earnings slide presentation which is available to download in the investor relation section of our website at www.statestreet.com. Afterwards we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our first quarter slide presentation. Today\u2019s presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today in our first quarter slide presentation under the heading forward-looking statements and in our SEC filings, including the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10 (k). Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. I\u2019m pleased with our first quarter 2015 results, which reflect strong fee revenue growth over first quarter 2014, continued momentum of our core business, and our focus on managing expenses. We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the first quarter of 2015, we completed the final phase of our $1.7 billion common stock purchase program announced in March of 2014 with the purchase of 6.3 million of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors approved $1.8 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve board\u2019s 2015 CCAR process.  Our 2015 capital plan also includes a proposed increase on our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share starting in the second quarter of 2015, which our board will consider in May.  Now I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business was affected. The first quarter was characterized by further monetary policy easing in several jurisdictions outside the US. Some of the moves were anticipated, but a few were not. Not only have these policy changes tended to support global equity markets, they have also contributed to higher volatility, particularly in the fixed income and foreign exchange markets. Recent weekly US economic data and Federal Reserve board members public commentary, have brought into question expectations for the timing and pace of interest rate increases in the US later this year.  However, the wave of global monetary easing by major central banks outside of the US has reinforced the trend of diverging monetary policies and continues to fuel the broad appreciation of the US dollar. Combined with ongoing political uncertainties across Europe, managed as well as floating exchange rates are being significantly pressured. Both the Russian and Brazilian Central Banks abandoned their intervention programs, while the Swiss National Bank abandoned its cap on the Swiss Franc Euro rate and moved interest rates deeper into negative territory. In addition the Central Banks in Australia and Canada also reduced interest rates to help their economies absorb lower commodity prices. These actions spurred an increase in FX volatility.  Monetary policy easing also impacted the fixed income markets in the first quarter. The ECB\u2019s announced an expanded asset purchase program, was larger and longer lasting than anticipated. Combined with the Swiss National Bank\u2019s moves, a significant and growing share of European sovereign bonds now have negative yields, which in turn is helping suppress yields around the globe. Together, these trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First and most significantly, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as our higher yielding portfolio investments mature or experience pre-payments and then those funds are reinvested in lower yielding investments.  Also, amidst the various Central Bank actions and changes to various market structures, we continue to experience high levels of deposits. As you know, we recently imposed charges for holding Euro deposits, which compensates us for the use of our balance sheet in a negative rate environment. We have also began a comprehensive program to further reduce our excess deposits, given the negative effect of these deposits on our capital ratios to better align our and customers\u2019 interests in the management of our level of deposits, given the new regulatory requirements. Second, our foreign exchange trading revenue was quite strong in the first quarter and we benefited from the higher volatility in the foreign exchange markets relative to Q1 2014 and Q4 2014. Our broad range of foreign exchange trading platforms continue to serve us well.  Finally, our first quarter 2015 fees avenue was negatively impacted by the strengthening US dollar, which was mostly offset by the favorable impact on first quarter 2015 expenses. Excluding these impacts, our core business performed well, benefiting from both the current relationships and continued expense discipline. Now I\u2019d like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management business. Our focus on developing and delivering solutions to serve clients\u2019 evolving needs, continues to position us well against global growth trends. Our first quarter 2015 net asset servicing wins totaled $215 billion, and importantly these wins are across sectors and geographies. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $336 billion at March 31 and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines.  In our asset management business, we experienced net outflows of $38 billion during the first quarter of 2015, driven by net outflows of $27 billion from ETFs, reflecting the first quarter seasonal outflows from our S&P 500 ETFs, $8 billion from institutional mandates and $3 billion from cash products. Outflows were driven primarily from lower yielding products -- lower revenue yielding products as evidenced by asset management revenues for the first quarter of 2015 being up from the first and fourth quarters of 2014, excluding the impact of a stronger US dollar.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the first quarter and after that we\u2019ll take your questions. Mike? Mike Bel : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I\u2019ll comment on a non-operating charge included in our 1Q \u201915 GAAP basis results. We recorded an after-tax charge of $150 million, or $0.36 a share for 1Q \u201915 to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. This accrual pertains to indirect FX matters which we\u2019ve disclosed over the past few years, and it reflects our intention to seek to resolve the outstanding claims asserted in the United States by federal governmental entities and civil litigants. It is possible that we will not be able to reach any settlement of these matters and the cost of any resolution could materially exceed our accrual. Our current efforts, even if successful, may not address all of our potential legal exposure arising out of these activities and other claims, which may be material, could be asserted against us. As I am sure you can appreciate, settlement discussions are confidential, and we are not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this time.  Now please turn to page seven in the slide presentation where I\u2019ll begin a discussion of our 1Q \u201915 operating basis results. Operating basis EPS for 1Q \u201915 increased to $1.17 per share from $0.99 in 1Q \u201914 and decreased from $1.37 in 4Q \u201914. Our first quarter results in 2014 and 2015 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to 1Q \u201914, EPS growth of 18% was driven by strong fee revenue growth, well controlled expenses, a favorable effective tax rate and the impact of our common stock repurchase program.  Operating basis total revenue increased 5%, with associated total fee revenue increasing approximately 7% from 1Q\u201914, while operating basis total expenses increased 1% from 1Q \u201914. Our operating basis effective tax rate for 1Q \u201915 was 28.4%, which is lower than our expectation for the full year. On the capital front, in 1Q \u201915, we purchased approximately $470 million on our common stock, completing our March 2014 common stock repurchase program. In addition, we announced a new common stock repurchase program of up to $1.8 billion, and subject to approval by our board of directors, a planned increase of our quarterly common stock dividend, for 2Q 2015 to $0.34 a share.  Slide eight shows we delivered strong 1Q \u201915 operating basis EPS growth over 1Q 2014. Primary drivers included strong fee revenue growth and the impact of our common stock share repurchases.  Turning to slide nine, I\u2019ll now discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 1Q, 2015 and notable variances to 1Q \u201914 and 4Q \u201914. First I would note that the stronger US dollar adversely impacted total fee revenue by approximately $83 million compared to 1Q 2014 and $46 million compared to 4Q 2014. Net interest revenue was also negatively impacted by the stronger US dollar by approximately $14 million compared to 1Q \u201914 and by $7 million compared to 4Q \u201914. Compared to the year ago quarter, all fee revenue lines increased, with the strength in FX trading in particular supporting the 7% total fee revenue growth from 1Q \u201914.  Servicing fees were up from 1Q \u201914, primarily due to net new business and stronger US equity markets, partially offset by the impact of the stronger US dollar. Management fees increased 3% from 1Q \u201914, primarily due to net new business and stronger US equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger US dollar. In addition, 1Q 2015 included money market fee waivers of approximately $11 million.  Total trading services revenue in 1Q \u201915 increased significantly from 1Q\u201914 and 4Q '14 due to higher foreign exchange trading revenue, reflecting higher volatility in volumes. Securities finance revenue increased approximately 20% compared to 1Q \u201914, primarily due to increased new business and enhanced custody and higher volumes. Processing fees and other revenue were flat with Q1 2014 and decreased from Q4 \u201814 primarily due to lower earnings from joint ventures and lower revenue associated with tax advantaged investments.  Moving to slide 10, as you can see, our operating basis net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be challenged in the prolonged low interest rate environment. NIR decreased from Q4 \u201814 primarily due to a one-time loan repayment in Q4 \u201814 and the impact of lower market interest rates, partially offset by higher deposit levels. We continue to expect 2015 NIR to perform within the scenarios we communicated at our Investor Day. For your reference, we\u2019ve provided those slides in the appendix of the slide presentation along with the primary drivers and assumption underlying those scenarios.  To remind you, the first scenario assumes interest rates remains static and deposits remain level with 2014 year end levels. Under this scenario, we expect operating basis net interest revenue for 2015 to be in the range on $2.07 billion to $2.17 billion. The second scenario we presented to you assumes that administered interest rates will begin to increase later this year. Under this scenario, we expect short term market interest rates to increase in advance of the increase in administered rates. We estimate that operating basis 2015 net interest revenue in this scenario to be in the range of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion.  And before discussing 1Q 2015 expenses, please note that we continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. This assumes that we achieve our operating basis total fee growth object of 4% to 7% in 2015. Moving to slide 11, you can see on the top of the slide there were some notable expenses affecting 1Q 2015 results. The stronger US dollar benefited total expenses by approximately $77 million compared to 1Q 2014 and $39 million compared to 4Q 2014. In addition, 1Q 2015 compensation and employee benefits, those expenses increased from 4Q 2014 primarily due to an incremental $137 million associated with seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employee and payroll taxes.  Lastly, other expenses included $20 million in securities processing costs and an additional $8 million for a new bank levy in Europe. Other expenses increased from the year ago quarter primarily due to additional required regulatory costs and higher securities processing costs. Compared to 4Q 2014, other expenses decreased, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a number of 4Q 2014 other expenses and lower professional services costs.  Turning to slide 12, I'll provide a brief overview of our March 31, 2015 balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to evolve as we respond to regulatory changes, including the liquidity rules. Our liquidity coverage ratio is currently above 100%. In addition, the investment portfolio maintained a higher credit quality profile and our duration was in line with the prior quarter. Lastly, the after-tax unrealized mark-to-market gain as of March 31, 2015 was $699 million, which improved from year end, primarily due to a decline in interest rates and title credit spreads.  Now turn to slide 13 to review our capital position. As you can see, we remain well capitalized which has enabled us to accomplish a top priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As of March 31, 2015, our fully phased-in capital ratios have declined modestly relative to year end. The decrease in the common equity tier 1 ratio under the Basel III fully phased in advanced and standardized approaches, which principally due to the Q1 2015 charge associated with foreign matters. The fully phased in holding company supplementing leverage ratio, decreased from 4Q 2014, principally due to a higher average balance sheet as of March 31, 2015 and the 1Q 2015 charge associated with foreign exchange matters. We are comfortable we have the levers that will enable us to be in compliance with the supplementary leverage ratio requirements in advance of the January 1, 2018 effective date.  Returning capital to shareholders continues to be a top prior as evidenced by the capital actions included in your CCAR 2015 capital plan. As we communicated at our Investor Day, leverage ratios continue to be our near term binding constraint and this was further highlighted by our DFAST 2015 and CCAR 2015 results. This constraint has been driven by the growth in our balance sheet, primarily as the result of higher client deposits. While operational deposits are integral to the overall service that we provide our custody clients, growth in excess deposits has pressured our capital ratios and we\u2019ve began a program designed to reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. For example starting in April, we increased the rate we are charging for Euro deposits. Based upon our discussions with clients, we are also developing other initiatives that appropriately balance our clients\u2019 needs with our economic and regulatory objectives. Overall, we are targeting a net reduction in excess deposits over the remainder of the year. In addition, we continue to plan our capital action carefully and as previously disclosed, we plan to issue approximately $750 million of preferred equity in 2015. In summary, our 1Q 2015 results were driven by strong fee revenue, well controlled expenses and a favorable effective tax rate. We continue to focus our key priorities of delivering value-added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. We continue to expect 2015 total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014 and we continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. We expect NIR headwinds are like to continue as illustrated within the scenarios we communicated at our Investor Day. Lastly, we continue to expect our operating basis effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% for the full year 2015. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Jay Jay Hooley :  Thank Mike. Brandy, we are now -- Mike and I are now available to handle questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Shirr from Evercare ISI Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I guess the balance sheet is up 9 % thereabouts year on year, so it\u2019s good for supporting net interest income while the NIM has its issues. But as you mentioned, it impacts the capital and SLR. So curious to on how you\u2019re balancing that. And then related question is I noticed that mortgages and asset backs had declined the most somewhere between 10% and 25%. Is that just straight runoff or is that a purposeful decline to impact the capital ratios as well? Thanks Jay Hooley : Glenn, let me start and then Mike will comment on the balance sheet construction. This issue of growing deposits and the pressure on our capital ratios, let me just tease out for a minute how we\u2019re approaching that because I think it's important. We are working with our customers. We\u2019ve had series of discussions. So we\u2019ve brought out into the open the concern we have is somewhat ironically the clients, particularly in the asset management segment, have the same issues. SEC and other regulatory agencies are forcing them to do more liquidity stress testing on their portfolios, which is one of the causes for excess deposits ending up on our balance sheet.  We have -- we\u2019ve developed some tools just recently through our global exchange business, portfolio stress testing tools that we\u2019ve been sharing with our costumers so that as they look at their liquidity needs, it can be done more scientifically. We are working with them to want to understand their liquidity needs and we think from that will come a reduction in their liquidity needs, which will reduce the deposits that end up on our balance sheet. I point that out because I think it's as more durable and sustainable approach than just forcing down excess deposits.  I also think the other thing that is in play here obviously is at some interest rate level, we want these deposits. So what we are really trying to unearth what deposits are truly excess, not needed for the liquidity needs of the fund and deposits that would likely run off anyway in a different interest rate environment. That\u2019s a little bit of where we are in our deposit strategy. Based on that, as Mike pointed out, we would expect our excess deposits to go down between now and end of year, but you might comment, Mike on the portfolio construction. Mike Bell : Sure, absolutely. Good morning, Glenn. Glenn, first, regarding the overall balance sheet and then moving into the portfolio. Regarding the overall balance sheet, we published at the end of first quarter an SLR on a fully phased in basis at the bank of 4.8%. And as we\u2019ve talked about previously, we do expect to be able to manage the levers between now and the 1/1/18 effective date to get that 4.8% up to at least 6%. And as Jay talked about, some of that will come from the excess deposits leaving us. Some of it will come from some financial engineering that we can do between the bank and the holding company and some of it we would expect to meet through pref issuance, including the $750 million that we have slated for 2015. Your arithmetic is accurate. I would just point out that we continue to feel good about the levers that we have in front of us.  On the specific question on the balance sheet, the short answer is that the runoff in the mortgage backs and asset backs are in fact by design. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not lost on you that the regulatory environment now, specifically the combination of the LCR and the SLR converge to basically encourage us to move towards more of a barbell kind of approach so that as an example we\u2019re holding more U.S treasuries, more Central Bank deposits than we\u2019ve done historically. At the other end it\u2019s not huge, but we have for example a modestly larger loan book, including leveraged loans in the $2.5 billion to $3 billion range. As a result, in the new environment, the piece of the portfolio that becomes then less valuable from a net return on capital standpoint tends to be the mortgage backs and asset backs that you described. So we would expect that as we over time move to more of this barbell kind of approach, that those would be the assets that are most likely to run off. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Josh Cohen : Good morning guys. This is actually Josh in place for Ken. What was the impact from activity levels on the servicing business this quarter? Mike Bell : Josh, it\u2019s Mike. Regarding the GS fees, they were down a little bit relative to Q4. It was not huge, but they were down modestly Q4 to Q1. Operator : Your next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : So on the excess deposit reduction, can you just help us think about the size of these deposits and what yields these are carried at and invested in right now? Mike Bell : Ashley, good morning. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding the deposits, first of all we estimate at on average in Q1, that our excess deposits were approximately $54 billion. And on average, those are earning in the -- again on average something in the high teens so call it 15 to 20 basis points of spread on those deposits. So if you back that out of our overall interest earning assets, you would see that the 101 basis point NIM would be a combination of high teens on the excess deposits and then something in the high 120s in terms of the core net interest margin on the remainder. Operator : Your next question is from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : I was wondering if you could give a sense of what the year over year expense growth would've been excluding FX translation. I think obviously the reported numbers look pretty good, but maybe you could speak more to the core execution on expense containment. And then what was the impact of FX translation on revenues and net income? Mike Bell : Sure Luke. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding your first question on expenses, so the reported expense number on an operating basis was up 1.3% on a year over year basis and again that\u2019s Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. If we take out the $77 million that I noted in my prepared remarks on the impact of the currency translation, it would say that the expenses would have been up 5.4% on a constant currency basis. And as you can imagine, that\u2019s roughly offset. Not completely offset, but roughly offset by a similar impact on fees. So the impact on fee revenue year over year was approximately $83 million of headwind, Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. And then the impact incremental to that from net interest revenue of the stronger US dollar was approximately $40 million. So $40 million Q1 2015 to Q1 2014. So if you take the $40 million of negative impact on NIR and take in the $6 million delta between the impact on fees and impact on expenses, that would say about $20 million was the headwind to earnings from the currency translation. So relative to a constant currency calculation so call that a little less than $0.04 a share. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Good morning everybody. So on the -- just taking a step back just a bigger picture I guess on the operating leverage, you guys had delivered pretty nice operating margin expansion year over year despite the currency headwinds. It looks like up in about 200 plus basis points year over year. But in your outlook for the full-year again for the whole Company your outlook remains kind of no operating leverage assuming rates stay at current levels, which increasingly feels like it will be the case. So I guess my question is, is the reason for not coming out with a little bit more optimistic guidance for the full year on the operating leverage a function of look, we don't know where FX trading is going to go and that's really been the main driver? Or is there something else we need to account for in the back half of the year that could take some of that upside out of the run rate? Mike Bell : Sure Alex. It\u2019s Mike. First, you\u2019re absolutely right. No change in the full year outlook relative to what we had just talked about 60 days or so ago at the Investor Day. Basically that\u2019s because at this point we really wouldn\u2019t over weight a single quarter. For example we think it\u2019s unlikely that the FX trading revenue will continue at the pace that it did in Q1. Generally the conditions for FX have been good, but I wouldn\u2019t characterize the first quarter rates which were exceptionally strong as being the new run rate going forward. So that\u2019s really the main punchline is no change in the underlying outlook, which again we view, Alex as being favorable with 4% to 7% fee revenue despite currency headwinds of somewhere between 200 and 300 basis points. That would say 7% to 10% fee revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We view that as a positive result. And as we talked about at the Investor Day with at least 200 basis points of daylight between fee revenue and expense growth, we view that as a real positive step forward in terms of productivity. Again even a bigger step forward than we took for full year 2014 relative to 2013. So again in terms of the items we can control, we feel good about the outlook. Obviously we cannot control all the market interest rates. As you noted correctly, that remains a headwind. We also acknowledge that the tax rate is likely to be higher for 2015, in fact higher than what it was in first quarter. That would be another headwind that is not truly within our control. Again we feel good about the outlook and do not feel like it made sense at this point to change it. Operator : Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank, please go ahead, sir. Brian Bedell : On the investment servicing like, Mike can you tell us with the dollar amount of the FX impact is 4Q to 1Q? And then Jay maybe the amount to be installed from the new custody wins at the end of the first quarter? And then maybe just an update on your enhanced custody efforts within securities lending as well. Mike Bell : Good morning, Brian. In terms of the Q4 to Q1 roll forward, GS fees were negatively impacted by currency translation by approximately $27 million. So it would have been essentially flattish Q4 to Q1 without the currency translation. Jay? Jay Hooley : Yeah, let me pick up and I\u2019d just remind you, Brian that 2014 to 2013 service fees were up some 9%. So we don\u2019t look at a single quarter as being terribly informative. The $336 billion of committed not yet installed, hard to characterize it any one way. It\u2019s a real mix of from traditional to offshore alternatives. No single big deals. It\u2019s not an 80/20 so that\u2019s good. It should feather in nicely over the next couple of quarters would be our expectation. On the enhanced custody, which drove a good deal of our period over period securities lending growth, we continue to see great interest in that product and it\u2019s coming from I would say some smaller products coming from new relationships. More of it is coming from expanding existing relationships and we find with the continued changing landscape in the investment bank world with prime brokers that enhanced custody continues to be a very attractive product. So we would anticipate that product to continue to growth and probably dominate the incremental growth in the securities lending line for some time to come. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Jay, I have a question for you just stepping away from earnings a little bit. Looking at your proxy when I look at the ROE targets for long-term incentive comp plans for management, you're using a 9% ROE target for this year and you earned 9.8% last year. So I'm trying to understand the rationale for the target that's being used being lower than last year and what to imply from that. Jay Hooley : Sure, Vivek. As you know, I can comment on it, but that would be the board and the executive comp committee that sets those targets. I think what\u2019s notable about that target is that it continues to move up. It doesn\u2019t have upside beyond the 9%. It does have downside at the 9%. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the board and executive comp committee continue to calibrate that number up, but are also mindful of the continued variation with regard to capital and some of the things that we\u2019re working through. So the expectation that that would move closer to 12% to 15% target over time, but for now the board is most comfortable with targeting that at 9%. Operator : Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Just want to \u2013 Jay, I think in the past you've talked about how emerging market equities can have maybe a little bit of an outsized impact on fee rates. Obviously emerging markets over the last month or so has had a very strong run. Think up 9% so far in April. Is it fair to assume that can still have a positive impact on fee rates in the second quarter if it's sustained? Or is it not just market appreciation, we also have to see flows? Just if you can just give us any kind of red box to think about this impact going forward if it's sustained? Jay Hooley : Sure. Happy to, Jim and your observation is on target, which is emerging market asset growth is a good thing proportionally as it relates to our asset growth and service fee revenue. You\u2019re also right that the last month has been very constructive for emerging markets growth and we would expect that if that continues, that would be a positive helper to the service fee line. Less influential, but important as well is the transaction volume that is associated with that. Transaction volume was a little soft in the first quarter, which is part of the drag on the service fee growth period over period. Again I\u2019d expect that if we see sustained upward movement in emerging markets the transaction growth will flow from that. So both positive towards the service fee growth. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Good morning. Jay, you announced a new head of the SSGA business. I wondered if you could give us a few words on expectations and maybe speak within that to the commentary in the press about focus on fixed income ETFs. Jay Hooley : Sure. We did announce, Betsy that Ron O'Hanley will be replacing the retiring Scott Powers. Scott will retire sometime mid this year and Ron is on board as of now. Ron, many of you would know, previously was at Bank of New York Mellon running the asset management, wealth management practice and then was President of Fidelity most recently. I\u2019ve known Ron as a customer, as an industry associate through the years and when Scott informed me that he wanted to retire, I began a conversation with Ron. That conversation was largely around SSGA\u2019s positon, its strategy, what I thought the opportunities were with that and I found Ron to be similar minded with regard to how we viewed the SSGA opportunity. Scott and Ron worked together for some years in a past life. So that makes the transition even smoother as they work together.  So with Ron on board, my expectation is that obviously with a new person, you look at strategy, but I would expect more tweaks to the adjustment as opposed to overhauls. I think what Ron and I find attractive about the SSGA franchise is its global nature, its institutional relationships and its end product areas, most notably ETFs and passive that continue to generate proportionally higher flows than the traditional active asset categories. I would say Ron loves the ETF franchise. He\u2019s a big believer in asset allocation overlays across ETFs for use in intermediary channels, institutional channels. The fixed income ETF which you referenced is also an area that we have been building out, but there\u2019s more to do. So I think that Ron coming on board, I expect that the transition will be smooth. He\u2019ll bring some new ideas to the mix, but fundamentally we have a similar view of how we can best leverage the SSGA franchise going forward. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, you guys are batting cleanup this quarter among the trust banks. Year-over-year operating leverage is a little bit more negative than your peers. And so I'm just wondering from your perspective why do you think that's the case? Is it, one, maybe the mix? Maybe it's just the impact of Europe for more equities. Would it be two, maybe the stage of your strategy? I know you are investing a lot in the digital enterprise. Maybe you could get some ins and outs from that. Or third, you think you\u2019re not executing as well as you'd like? Thanks. Jay Hooley : We don\u2019t think it\u2019s the third, Mike. I would say it\u2019s -- and you should expect as do you, we compare ourselves to our peers and we try not to focus on a single quarter. We think over longer periods that our performance has been good, if not better in most categories. I do think we look at this as a long term game where as you know we are continuing to drive product development which is creating innovation and topline growth. We think that we\u2019re best positioned in some of the faster growing asset classes, alternatives, ETFs, offshore funds. And so we don\u2019t sit back and ignore investments in those categories. So we\u2019re continuing to drive investment. On the other hand, you referenced the digital enterprise. We also, we\u2019d like to see improved environmental factors that could cause us to return to days of old.  We\u2019re not expecting that. So we\u2019re continuing to drive efficiency in the core operations. The digital enterprise does have some investment associated with it. It\u2019s designed to make us the low cost producer in some of those commodity activities that we generate. If you were to say what\u2019s the investment that\u2019s going into that, it\u2019s continuing to drive straight through processing, continuing to enhance the private cloud, moving more applications to the private cloud. Some of the new products that we\u2019ve introduced recently, I referenced the portfolio liquidity stress test tool which was built in the cloud fairly rapidly given the need.  TruCross which is a buy side to buy side foreign exchange platform which we introduced in the last quarter and a half also has those same characteristics. So we\u2019re trying to build for the long term, which means driving those unit costs down, being the lost cost producer in the core base line activities while continuing to invest in those products that continue to differentiate us in what we think are some of the more attractive segments of the investment services business. So as opposed to outperforming in a quarter, we would rather outperform over time and we think we\u2019re positioned to do that. Operator : Brennan Hawken with UBS, your question please. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. So it appears as though the seasonality in the SPDR ETFs is becoming more pronounced over the last few years. Does this concern you at any way and does it create any kind of constraints on your capabilities whether they be operational or capital markets oriented? And is there anything going on there that might be problematic or that you might want to adjust through your sales processes? Jay Hooley : Yeah, Brennan. Let me pick that up. I think the broad answer is no. your observation is accurate which is the SPDR S&P 500 is actively used for portfolio positioning. So it spikes, ebbs and flows at quarter end and beginning of the following period. As you expect, S&P highly liquid, so we don\u2019t worry about any operational issues related to the increased volumes going through the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. So really no, we don\u2019t worry about it. I think if you look at, I mentioned the negative flows to SSGA which were dominated by the S&P 500 which, while an attractive productive product, has relatively low revenues associated with it.  If you look at our currency adjusted performance for SSGA, it was 2% revenues quarter over quarter and 7% year over year. So I think while the big ETFs have high velocity to them, the revenue impact is relatively small. And as I\u2019ve said for several quarters, our focus is more on generating more differentiated, higher revenue producing ETFs. So just in the quarter we introduced seven new ETFs in SSGA. Maybe the most notable was the one with double line which is a total return ETF which has very attractive revenues associated with it and got off to a good start. So no real concern on the high velocity of the S&P 500 ETFs focused on leveraging that ETF business to produce more differentiated products with high revenue per asset mix. Operator : Your next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello there. Thank you for taking the question. On the comments you made around not seeing the first quarter for first quarter revenues in terms of FX trading as a run rate, is that because you think that volatility moves down a bit of first-quarter level if you look at the indices? Or is it more because some of the dislocation around the Swiss franc and QE kicking in in Europe just created wider spreads on FX trades that aren't going to be sustainable? Jay Hooley : Yeah. Let me pick that up, Jeff. Mike can comment if he has anything to add. More the latter. I think if you look at volatility, there was a real spike in the first quarter. You mentioned the Swiss National Bank de-peg. It was just a highly volatile quarter that was very conducive to foreign exchange volatility. We don\u2019t see that event obviously repeating itself, but we\u2019re very constructive overall on general volatility going forward and the positive effect it would have on our foreign exchange business. Volatility has gone up for three quarters if you look at the underlying drivers. I keep referencing the divergence of monetary policy. We began the year thinking that UK, US, Australia and the Canadians might begin to tighten.  The Australians and Canadians have gone the other way, but I\u2019d say the US and the UK are still on the mode of heading towards a policy tightening that monetary divergence is very constructive for foreign exchange volatility. So we think that there were exceptions in the first quarter which won\u2019t repeat, but overall very constructive on foreign exchange volatility going forward. I\u2019d also add that I think if you look at foreign exchange in the first quarter roughly 6%, 7% volume growth, both across platform and not platform business. We\u2019ve seen higher volume growth leading into this quarter which have driven the outperformance. So we will continue to expect we\u2019d see good volume growth and the volatility to persist, just not at the level that we saw in that first quarter. Mike? Mike Bell : No, that\u2019s perfect, Jay. Geoffrey Elliott : And just in terms of the overall impact on profitability of the FX revenues, is it fair to assume there is very little expense that goes against them maybe a little bit of comp, but not very much and most of it is just dropping to the bottom line? Mike Bell : Yes, Jeff. It\u2019s Mike. That\u2019s a fair assessment of the profitability of the high margin FX trading business. Operator : Your next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Beatty : Good morning. A follow-up on asset management, specifically multi-asset class solutions which I think is a relatively small but promising category. It looks like you've had some outflows there lately. Have there been certain products or maybe client mandates driving the outflows? And maybe more importantly, what's your plan for the category in the latest outlook? Jay Hooley : Let me take that, Adam. The outflows which are categorized in the institutional bucket were almost all from a single target date fund rebalance. So it was just helping a client rebalanced the target date. Very constructive on solutions and solutions has many meanings in the asset management industry I would say. For us, we\u2019ve made a big push on the 401(k) target date fund category where we\u2019ve had several new mandates and we have several promising prospects. But solutions also exist at a broader level where occasionally we\u2019ll compete frequently for institutional mandates where somebody will put out a mandate and ask you to come up with your best ideas to deliver against that set of assets. So it comes back a little bit to my comment that Betsy brought up in my discussion with Ron O'Hanley around using asset allocation as one of the key levers in driving our asset management business both at the target date fund, at the intermediary level where increasingly intermediaries are looking for solutions oftentimes derived out of ETFs, as well as at the big institutional bucket. So we think we have a lot of the right asset classes in the right chassis as in ETFs and we also believe we bring a lot of expertise with regard to asset allocation knowledge. So bringing those things together is one of the most important thrusts for SSGA going forward. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Mike. Good morning Jay. You pointed out, Mike, that you're mixing your assets a little differently because of the SLR and different capital ratios and you've added to your loan book. And I recognized the loan book as a percentage of assets is not very significant for you folks. It's less than your two competitors of course. But can you share with us on the leverage loans where do you think that may go on a go-forward basis? And your total loan growth was about 14% on a year-over-year basis. Should we expect that kind of growth to continue for the rest of the year? Mike Bell : Sure, Gerard. It\u2019s Mike. Regarding leverage loans specifically, I would expect that that will remain a relatively small part of the overall balance sheet. So at this point we have a total asset there of $2.7 billion. I would expect that we\u2019ll probably have some growth over time relative to that $2.7 billion, but I think it\u2019s unlikely that it would grow that it would get to the point where it was say double that number. I think that\u2019s highly unlikely for the foreseeable future. So again it is a nice complement to the derisking that we\u2019ve had to do as Glenn had asked about derisking moving out of mortgage back and asset backs into treasuries.  It gives us a little bit of an offset relative to that, but not a huge part of our overall balance sheet. The rest of the loan book primarily relates to loans that we\u2019ve made in support of our client relationships, specifically for example loans to 40 Act funds would be an example. Again under the new regulatory expectations, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have a significant amount of growth in that business simply because those tend to be relatively tight spread loans. And again in an environment where the SLRs are binding constraint, that\u2019s a challenge. So I would not say that we would expect a huge growth in the loan book really for the remainder of 2015. Operator : Your final question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had a quick question on regulatory and compliance costs. You mentioned previously that they were going to be up year on year and first quarter you said that they were up. But if I think about it from the first quarter to the fourth quarter, are they going to go up from the first quarter or is that $300 million run rate in the other expenses a good run rate for that line item? Mike Bell : Brian, it\u2019s Mike. First, I think what\u2019s most important really of course is the full year outlook and I\u2019ve made the comments around the full year outlook on expense growth relative to fee growth a couple of times. I think that\u2019s the most important thing is to look at the overall expense levels as opposed to just a single line item like other operating expenses. Nevertheless in answer to your direct question, I do expect that we\u2019ll see an increase in other operating expenses over the course of 2015. Again that category tends to be somewhat lumpy, but it\u2019s typically driven by a combination of regulatory compliance spending as well as legal expenses. I do expect that those will be higher than the levels that we saw in Q1 which were seasonally low. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Jay Hooley : Okay, Brandy. Thank you and thanks to everyone for participating on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you during the second quarter call which will happen in July. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks Anthony and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter 2015 results reflect the strength of our core business as evidenced by 4% growth in service fees compared to the first quarter of 2015 and the benefit of the seasonal increase in securities finance activity. Net interest revenue in the second of 2015 continued to experience pressure as resulted the ongoing low interest rate environment. Overall we remain on track for the growth rate of operating basis fee revenue to exceed the growth rate of operating basis expenses by at least 200 basis points in 2015. We remained focused on returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2015 we purchased approximately 350 million of our common stock and have approximately $1.45 billion remaining on our March 15th, common stock purchase program authorizing the purchase of $1.8 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2016. We also increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Now I would like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. Europe has been a major source of marketing stability in the recent past. First modest signs of recovery against the backdrop of zero or even negative yield contributed to the sharpest rise in European bond yield since the resolution of the European debt crisis back in 2010. European equity markets responded by giving back half of the year-to-date gains from the peak of May 21st with some recoveries more recently. The European debt crisis is still of course very much with us in the form of Greece and has monopolized the headlines from much of the past few weeks. The uncertainty as to whether a deal with Greece could first be reached and now implemented has helped to push investors to move assets away from emerging markets and also contributed to increased foreign exchange volatility and volumes compared to the second quarter of 2014. However volatility in FX market was lower than first quarter 2015. Not all the risk in global markets has been driven by Europe, Chinese equities fell by more than 30% from the peak giving back more than half of the gains for the year and it's concerned about the growth in China. Although recently government [intervention] has provided some support to equity markets there. Combined these significant disruptions drove market down in June and into July and have reduced risk appetite. Despite these international risks our view of divergence in 2015 still holds as we see easing of monetary policy outside the U.S. but we still expect to see tightening in the U.S. This led to a much stronger U.S. dollar so far in 2015. Much of the initial change occurred in a first quarter 2015 in anticipation of U.S. tightening and the US dollar has generally moved sideways since then as the markets are waiting to see when tightening might actually start in the U.S. Together these events and trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First and most significantly, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin as a higher yielding portfolio investments mature or experience pre-payments and then those funds are reinvested in lower yielding investments. Second, amidst the various Central Bank actions and changes to various market structures, we continue to experience high levels of deposits. As you know, we imposed charges for holding Euro deposits in the fourth quarter 2014 with a number of increases in the charges so far this year. We are continuing to have discussions with our clients regarding excess deposits given the negative effect of these deposits on our capital. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar has slowed the growth of our servicing fee revenue relative to 2014. However it's important to note that excluding the impact of the stronger US dollar our core business performed well benefiting from growth in our client relationships. Furthermore towards the end of second quarter 2015 we start a number of significant market disruptions which reduced risk appetite. Now I'd like to discuss asset servicing and asset management businesses. Demonstrating a continuing priority to provide solutions to our clients we added a 143 billion of new servicing commitments during the second quarter. Importantly these wins were broadly diversified across sectors and geographies. U.S. to be serviced that remained to be installed in Q2 period totaled $174 billion at June 30 and we continue to see deep and diverse pipeline. Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $65 billion during the second quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $36 billion from institutional passive equity, 17 billion from ETF primarily institutionally oriented market index funds and 17 billion from cash products. The significant drivers of passive equity outflows were included rebalancing and cash need by some of our clients due to lower commodity prices. Despite the net asset outflows the impact on net new business revenues were relatively minimal because much of the redemptions were priced lower than the net contributions we received in the quarter. Our asset management business continues to be innovative and has launched 45 new products in the first six months of 2015. OneLine is off to a fast start is despite a double line total return taxable ETF which is an active fixed income ETF launched in partnership with DoubleLine, it's attracted 800 million in net flows post launch which ranks as the second most successful ETF launched in the U.S. this year. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who'll review our financial performance for the second quarter and after that Mike and I will be open to take your call. Mike Bell : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I\u2019ll comment on a non-operating charge included in our 2Q '15 GAAP basis results. We recorded an after-tax charge of $156 million, or $0.37 a share in 2Q '15 to increase our legal accrual associated with indirect foreign exchange matters. Although we believe these recorded legal accruals will address the financial demands associated with the previously disclosed claims and active investigations regarding our indirect foreign exchange business asserted in the United States by governmental entities and civil litigants. Significant non financial terms remain outstanding and settlement agreements have not been finalized. Consequently there can be no assurance that we will enter into these settlements that the cost of the new settlements or other resolutions of any such matters will not materially exceed our accruals or that other potentially material claims related to our indirect foreign exchange business will not be asserted against us. As I'm sure you can appreciate settlement discussions are confidential and we're not able to make more specific comments on these matters at this time. Now refer to Slide 7 for discussion of our 2Q '15 operating business results and from the six months ended June 30, 2015 which I'll refer to as year-to-date. By way of summary 2Q '15 results were driven by strong servicing fees and the seasonal increase in securities finance revenue offset by lower FX trading revenue and continued pressure on NIR. Year-to-date EPS increased approximately 7% compared to the year ago period. Total revenue increased 3.3% from the year ago period reflecting strength in core servicing and management fees. Trading services revenue and securities finance, partially offset by lower NIR and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Compared to the year ago period year-to-date fee revenues were negatively impacted by approximately a $149 million from the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. Our operating basis effective tax rate for 2Q '15 was 29.6% which is lower than our current expectation for the full year. The first half of 2015 operating basis effective tax rate of 29.1% is also lower than our current full year 2015 expectations primarily due to some one-time items in the first half of 2015 and the timing of our tax advantage investments. We continue to expect the operating basis tax rate to average within a range of 30% to 32% over the course of the full year. On the capital front in 2Q 2015 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. In addition we issued $750 million of preferred stock during 2Q 2015 with the first semiannual dividend to be paid in the third quarter of 2015. On Slide 8, year-to-date fee revenue increased 5.1% while expenses increased 2.4% versus a year-ago. Importantly on a constant currency basis year-to-date fee revenue increased 8.8%. We continue to make progress against our targets for operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2014. Turning now to Slide 10, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 2Q '15. First I would note that the stronger U.S. dollar adversely impacted total fee revenue by approximately $71 million as compared to 2Q '14 with a similar benefit to total expenses. Net interest revenue was adversely impacted by the strong U.S. dollar by approximately $17 million compared to 2Q '14. Foreign currency translation did not materially affect sequential quarterly results. Servicing fees were up from 2Q '14 primarily due to net new business and stronger U.S. equity markets partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis servicing fees were up approximately 7% compared to the year-ago period. Management fees increased modestly relative to the year-ago primarily due to higher U.S. equity markets and net new business partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. On a constant currency basis management fees increased approximately 6% compared to the year-ago period. Total trading services revenue increased from 2Q 2014 due to higher FX trading revenue reflecting higher volatility in volumes. Compared to 1Q '15 FX trading revenue decreased due to lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased from 2Q '14 primarily due to new business in enhanced custody and was higher than 1Q '15 reflecting the seasonal increase of revenues in this business which tends to peak in the second quarter. Processing fees and other revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue associated with tax evasion investments. Moving now to Slide 11. You can see our operating basis net interest revenue and net interest margin continue to be challenged in the prolonged low interest rate environment. Operating basis in IR decreased from 2Q '14 primarily due to lower market interest rates partially offset by higher client deposits. Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review 2Q '15 operating basis expenses. Total operating basis expenses increased 3.5% compared to 2Q 2014. As a reminder 1Q '15 expenses included an incremental $137 million associated with the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to the 2Q 2014 result compensation and benefits expenses increased modestly reflecting increased cost to support to business and regulatory initiatives mostly offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar. Transaction processing service expenses increased primarily due to higher volumes. Occupancy expenses decreased from 1Q '15 reflecting certain one-time positive items in 2Q '15 for 3Q '15 we expect occupancy expenses to increase as the beneficial items of 2Q '15 are unlikely to repeat. Other operating expenses increased sequentially and from the year-ago quarter primarily due to additional regulatory and compliance costs. Turning now to Slide 13. I will provide a brief overview of our June 30, 2015 balance sheet. During 2Q '15 we took several actions to move towards our balance sheet optimization and regulatory compliance objectives. The impact included a small increase in the duration of our investment portfolio assets. Now turn to Slide 14 to review our capital position. As you can see we remained well capitalized which has enabled us to accomplishing top priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. At June 30th, our common equity Tier 1 ratios under the Basal III fully phased in standardized approach increased from March 31st principally due to lower credit risk. Under the fully phased and advanced approach our common equity Tier 1 ratios remained relatively unchanged from March 31st.  The fully phased in holding company supplementary leverage ratio increased from 1Q '15 primarily due to the issuance of $750 million of preferred stock in 2Q '15. On Monday Federal Reserve issued the final [GSIP] rule which contains the methodology used to determine the capital surcharge for the eight systematically important U.S. Banks. The Federal Reserve's estimate for State Street indicates a surcharge of 1.5% and this is consistent with our discussion of the potential impact of the proposed rule during our investor day this past February. The primary driver of the higher surcharge under the final rule is a level of non-operational deposits from clients which rule classifies short-term wholesale funds. Now that the rule is final we'll incorporate the surcharge into our balance sheet and capital optimization efforts. Since excess deposits on the primary driver on the higher surcharge this final rule increases the importance of our objective to materially reduce these excess deposits. Now I'll guess the question likely we are on investors and analyst minds and that is how is our program tracking to reduce the level of excess deposits or our balance sheet. We continue to have discussions with our largest clients regarding the implications for our balance sheet associated with excess deposits and to work together to identify solutions. Although these discussions were constructive our average excess deposits in 2Q '15 did increase as the external factors driving these balances did not abate. We continue to take actions appropriate for each market for example in Europe we've increased the rate we are charging for Euro deposits. So overall we're targeting a net reduction in excess deposits over the remainder of the year from the 2Q '15 levels. Turning now to Slide 15, we continue to maintain our outlook for the full year 2015. Despite the weaker Euro exchange rate we continue to expect 2015 total operating basis fee revenue to increase 4% to 7% compared to full year 2014. We also continue to target our operating basis total fee revenue growth to outpace our operating basis expense growth by at least 200 basis points for the full year 2015 relative to 2104. Regarding NIR we expect full year 2015 operating basis NIR to be between $2.16 billion and $2.22 billion. The range assumes that the Fed increases rates in December of 2015. The administered rates do not change in Europe and client deposits will decline over the remainder of the year from their 2Q '15 levels. We expect to the year at the lower-end of the range as there are no rate increases in the U.S. Lastly we continue to expect our operating basis effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 32% for the full year of 2015. Since our 2015 year-to-date tax rate was 29.1%, we expect the operating basis effective tax rate for the back half of 2015 to be in the range of 32% to 34%.  So in summary our 2Q '15 results were driven by positive momentum in servicing fees and securities finance seasonality offset by softer FX trading revenue and continued pressure on net interest revenue. We continue to focus on our key priorities in delivering value-added solutions to our clients, investing in growth initiatives, diligently managing expenses and returning capital to shareholders. And with that I'll turn the call back to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks Mike and I have nothing further to say, Holly so we can open the call up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. I'll now introduce to our first caller. Your first caller's name is Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : How you thinking about the duration of your portfolio and capacity to extend and like a 50% of your portfolio now being fixed which is the highest it has been in the while and only 1 billion of purchases in 2Q which is a lowest as it's been in a while. Mike Bell : So, good morning Ashley it's Mike. First of all there is been no change in our overall philosophy Ashley and that is that as it relates to the investment portfolio we continue to invest through the cycle. We continue to have the same type of ALM kinds of risk management practices that we've had in the past. Related to your specific question around the durations, yes it is the case that the -- we can sell in particular some floating rate ABS securities into queue and as a result what's left in the portfolio doesn't have longer average duration but again importantly the overall duration of the assets out of our balance sheet did not change materially quarter-over-quarter. As those -- we did have a higher amount left in cash at the end of the quarter. So again I would expect that there would be no material change over the remainder of the year in terms of our philosophy but we will continue to make these tactical changes to work towards balance sheet optimization particularly under the new regulatory requirements. Ashley Serrao : So does this also mean that the -- that the time line that you provided at analyst day for NIM to reset to higher levels remains unchanged. Mike Bell : That is correct Ashley. At this time no change to those longer-term expectations. So obviously there is a lot going on in the environment in terms of how long will it take to get there between market interest rates and the regulatory environment but no change at this point in terms of our long-term expectations. Ashley Serrao : Final question here. Can you just give us an update on your efforts to bolster your European ETF business? And also to drive a focus on return on capital from a compensation standpoint? Jay Hooley : Let me start that one Ashley, the ETF business is present in North America, Europe and Asia although as you I think pointed out we\u2019re much more heavy in the U.S. than in Europe and we've been focusing on the European ETF business. It's been really in two dimensions, one is adding distribution wholesalers that largely sell into the private bank and banking networks on the continent in Europe that\u2019s going well. We've made several hires over the course of the last six months. So from a standpoint of feet on the ground distribution we continue to ramp up. Actually the second place that our efforts are going is in the product development side which is a kind of a two key elements of successfully to add franchise. And as I noted in my comments 45 new products introduced so far this year, some portion of those are in Europe. So I would say the effort is underway, we think it's a robust opportunity for us, one of the key opportunities for SSGA. Your second question Ashley was our efforts to improve our return on equity? Ashley Serrao : First from a compensation standpoint, when you look at new business? Jay Hooley : Look at new business, I'm still not sure I got the source of the question. Let me try. Maybe you are referring to is that recently as return on capital has been a more prominent part of how you look at us and how we look at our business. We've turned to looking at return on capital from a customer standpoint and we will have by the end of the year, I think our top 200 customers all calculated out with regards to what the return on capital is, and those statistics end up with client relationship people and their challenge is to improve that return on capital. And I think the closer we get that to our top customers the better shot we have at rebalancing mix whether it's product mix or client profitability in order to drive improved return on capital for initially that 200 customers. And we think between what we\u2019re doing at the top of the house principally on the balance sheet and in excess deposits and then what we\u2019re doing with those 200 customers that\u2019s the right blend of strategies in order to make sure that we consistently improve our return on equity over time. Mike Bell : Ashley it's Mike I would just add two other points. One is we have incorporated that same discipline in terms of looking at returns at the client level on prospected new business as well. So it is both a new business initiative as well as the existing customers that the Jay described. And the second point I would do is just to reinforce something that Jay said and that is in the near-term the most important thing we can do to improve the company's ROE is to reduce the non-operational deposits and or get those price that they are going to stay on the balance sheet get those price to pay for the required capital that\u2019s associated in, and I can assure that the entire management team is aligned around that effort. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Curious, on Slide 24 you gave us the ex-currency impact on both revenue season and expenses. I guess my question is with the operating expenses up 7.4% year-on-year ex-currency, a lot of that\u2019s driven by the other line and that\u2019s legal and regulatory. Are you able to pars that out on what\u2019s legal and what\u2019s regulatory because obviously going forward we\u2019re going to just be able to strip out what\u2019s the bottom-line there is a lot of moving parts here. Fees we get are still growing, currencies impacting but it seems like expenses is just still keeping pace with the revenues. Mike Bell : Sure Glenn its Mike. It is the case that the major driver on the year-over-year increase in other operating expenses is the regulatory compliance expenses. And in particular the outside consulting expenses we had communicated to you at Q1 that we thought those were seasonally low and they have certainly rebounded here at Q2. Basically the work that we have underway right now is number one, over time to reduce those outside consulting expenses by completing the projects, completing and getting up to fully acceptable regulatory expectations but also second over time replacing those outside consultants with full time staff. And so I do expect that we will see a reduction in the second half of the year in terms of the other operating expenses related to both of those, I would rather at this not put a precise number on it because it depends upon a number of factors not the least of which is our success rate in terms of hiring full time staff to replace these people. But it is the case of the big driver is the regulatory compliance expenses. Now I would point out just to be completely balanced that we're still on track to meet our full year expectation and that is to have fee revenue growth outpace our overall expense growth by at least 200 basis points. And we view that as a positive accomplishment in this environment. As I've described to you before that's a better result than we had in that metric in 2014 so again in light of the regulatory situation we view that as a positive step forward. Glenn Schorr : Just one other follow up. On the securities finance revenue is up I guess 5%, a lot of it is new business and the environment. I'm just curious, what's enhanced custody and if you're seeing any pressures on either rates, spreads or fee splits? Mike Bell : Sure Glenn, in terms of enhanced custody, enhanced custody was a little less than a third of the securities finance revenue in Q2 so specifically was $48 million of revenue out of a 155 in Q2. In terms of the spreads and fee splits I would say no material change in that environment. I would note that the seasonal trade was in fact less valuable than it's been in prior years. So there wasn't as much benefit from seasonality given the European economic situation. So that in fact was a modest headwind in Q2 versus what it's been in prior years. Glenn Schorr : Just a tiny follow up on the expense commentary we just had. Does that mean the second half on the other line stays at this level given that you know you're still building out the BSAML systems and things like that, should we look for that to on the year-on-year basis still grow but on an absolute dollar basis be level? Mike Bell : Glenn, relative to Q2, I would expect the other operating expenses to be lower in Q3 and Q4 subject to the caveat that that does, it does assume that number one we are effective in executing the initiatives that we have on the table right now. And number two, that we are successful in hiring additional full time staff to replace those outside consulting expenses. And again neither of those are trivial but my expectation at this point is that 338 will not be the run rate going forward to the second half of the year that it would be something lower. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Mike if I could ask you a question about balance sheet leverage on deposits. First of all can you try to help us understand how much you're going to try to move off the balance sheet on those excess deposits? What kind of effect do you think you can have on the leverage ratio and whether the impact of those deposit outflows is reflected in your outlook for NIR? Mike Bell : Sure Ken, good morning. First on the on your specific question on how much do we expect to get off the balance sheet. At this point Ken I'd really prefer not to put a precise number on it, we are in the midst of client communications as we speak and it is a sensitive issue. So we're really looking for a win-win with our clients. I mean just to give a couple of examples, several of our 40 Act fund clients for example are feeling more pressured to hold more liquidity as a result of their own regulatory pressure. So again it's not just a question of basically demanding that that liquidity comes off. So instead we're really looking for the win-win there. Another example would be in Europe where certainly with all the turmoil going on economically there we have been viewed as a safe haven by several of our important clients now we're obviously charging more for European deposits than we were earlier this year and we recognize that given the economics of having to issue additional prefs to ultimately pay for these deposits that ultimately we need to earn something in the 60 to 70 basis point range of interest margin to pay for the prefs. It is important either to charge enough to make the economics work or to get the deposits off the balance sheet. And the latter we think could occur either through us charging more or through finding a different win-win with our clients or in fact we think it will naturally happen as interest rates rise. So again I at this point really not commit to a number but I'd rather tell you that we are expecting a reduction in deposit levels in the second half of the year. As it relates to your question around NIR what I would remind you is that on average right now for excess deposits we estimate that we're earning a spread in the high teens. So based on that you could conclude that a $10 billion drop in our average excess deposits would reduce near term NIR by $4 million to $5 million in a quarter. And that is built into the updated NIR range that I gave you in the prepared remarks. So I'd rather not give you a specific number but that is the thinking that is in the overall range. Ken Usdin : And then just as a quick follow-up. How do we understand the go, no-go decision on timing and magnitude preferred potential? Mike Bell : Sure, Ken regarding prefs, it really will depend upon a number of things including the overall environment and will include our success rate; both that we're seeing to date but also our expected continued success rate on reducing the level of non-operational deposits. It will include our analysis of our balance sheet for the next CCAR period which is Q4 of this calendar year. So again I'm confident that we could issues prefs if we need to but at this point I would not tell you that we've drawn specific conclusions on a pref insurance plan. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just on the excess deposits. Can you just give us some number of what they currently are or what the range that you view for excess deposits and then the deposit levels in Europe and UK. Mike Bell : Regarding our current level of excess deposits if we look at Q2 average in particular we estimate that our Q2 average excess deposits were approximately $62 billion which is an increase relative to Q1 of approximately 8 billion. Now importantly I would add for completeness, please remember here that the LCR rules are now in effect and therefore because of our interpretation of those rules and the regulatory expectations related to those rules. Some of the deposits that we've historically thought of as operational deposits don\u2019t in fact qualify under the LCR to be operational deposits. So specifically for example, our hedge fund clients and private equity clients just as part of their normal operations is part of us being the custody service provider. We have viewed those historically as operational deposits but there is specifically excluded under the LCR regulations to be included as those. So the round number is 20 billion deposits from those are clients, a portion of those need to be ultimately added to the 62 billion as we calculate LCR over the future. So it's another example of the regulatory environment forcing us to be more conservative than we've done historically. So again 62 under our traditional method and let me -- look at this as TBD, as the LCR further unfolds. As it relates to your question around European deposits we did see an increase in deposits in Europe, specifically Q2 average European deposits were $40.5 billion. So call that 36 billion to 37 billion of Euro balance and that was up about 4$.5 billion. relative to the Q1 average levels. Jay Hooley : Brian, just to give you a little -- this is Jay, maybe provide a little bit of nuance color. I was just in Europe a few weeks and I was directly involved in some of these discussions with customers and we're for the major customers who have meaningful excess balance. We're speaking to all of them and I would say a couple of things that to me you're encouraging, I'm convinced we'll make headwind against those. I don\u2019t how much, but when -- but one day we acknowledge the issue, it's a broad based issue. There's even some pressure on the European Banks finally to shed some of these deposits as well. So it's become a more broad based issue. I think the discussions -- I reading to some creative alternatives for suites and another approaches to move these deposits off and Mike mentioned that average quarter-to-quarter we've actually seen some progress in some of these specific customers. So, it helps so we're out in front of it, I think the discussions are going well. I think we'll find ourselves with lower excess deposits we end the year. It's hard to say how much. Brian Bedell : And the period ended up much higher but we should probably ignore the -- sincerity and the period numbers that we are assuming. Your idea has really has the direction of the deposit good [ones] and for an average basis is it correct? Mike Bell : That is correct -- we typically see spikes at quarter end but I think the average is more relevant because in fact the capital ratios for example our calculated based on the average. Brian Bedell : And then great just my follow up would be as you were talking before about to look into top 200 customers and trying to assess the return on capital from assessments and then I think you also mentioned you're using this framework for new business and maybe either Jay or Mike you could comment on -- I know banking Europe -- that large middle office deal with Euro that something in the -- you would typically win since you're by far the leader in middle office. How maybe you could frame sort of the view on assessing that for new customers in the go forward dynamic of middle office whether you think you might be more competitive or more disciplined going forward? Jay Hooley : So I think broadly Brian when you put the return on capital and on a prospective customer, the places that get accentuated are things like any loans that we might have, securities lending particularly indemnified REPO within the product set from services to foreign exchange to securities lending to fund accounting they all have slightly different return on equity calculation. So by looking at it through a return on capital lens you do get a more holistic view. I would say relative to middle-office it's really a profitability equation. It doesn't draw any capital necessarily it's really-- can you drive sufficient profitability in order to make a middle-office deal make sense in the construct of a piece of a larger relationship. So I deal with probably more as a traditional accounting and custody relationship as far as its return characteristics but the key component is can you money? As you know we have -- we think it's over 10 trillion in assets that we administer in the middle-office and have been have at this for 15 years maybe. We've learned a lot through the 15 years about what makes us a successful middle-office deal. And for me it's largely about the complexity factor whether it involves lift outs, the degree of customization on the system side. So we continue to have handful of middle-office prospects out there and we look pretty closely at whether or not we can make them a creative rate return over the reasonable period of time. Brian Bedell : And so you are still favorable on this business I assume. Jay Hooley : Yes. And I would say just from a broader trend basis Brian you have no doubt heard more than you probably want to hear about us on our regulatory compliance challenge here it's hitting asset managers, it's hitting asset owners and so middle-office will continue to be a very important incremental product that we sell. We just need to make sure that it's done well with good pricing discipline. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery : Another stab at the securities portfolio, I know you have been realigning the mix of securities for the LCR and then fine tuning the balance sheet overall for the SLR. But in dollar terms what\u2019s driving the shrinkage of the portfolio and should we expect that to continue? Is that part of managing the overall duration of the balance sheet? Mike Bell : Sure, Luke its Mike. First in terms of what\u2019s driving our optimization work, I would really put it in the three different buckets. The first is that, overall we want to improve our capital ratios and then includes the risk based ratios as well as the leverage ratios. Second, we\u2019re looking to improve our mark-to-market sensitivity as measured at the next CCAR cycle, so that\u2019s a consideration and then third of course is the meeting the heightened liquidity expectation. So specifically if we look at for example the sale of our folding rate ABS that\u2019s a good example where we\u2019re getting a relatively low printed spread that we viewed it as having a relatively high mark-to-market sensitivity during the CCAR cycle and of course it doesn't count as HQ away. So that would be an example of something to shrink. I would not characterize the changes in the securities portfolio as part of an overall change in the duration of the assets on our balance sheet, as I said in one of the earlier answers the overall duration of the assets of our balance sheet did not change materially sequentially. So in fact what we did was we decreased the folding ABS securities which meant that the remaining duration of the remaining portfolio got longer, but that money for the most part is sitting in cash. I would expect that we would be deploying over the second half of the year round number is approximately 5 billion that at June 30th was sitting in cash. So I would not expect that, again it's based on whole lot of different factors but I would not expect additional shrinkage in the overall investment portfolio in dollar terms over the remainder of the year. But again importantly it is optimization is somewhat of the rubik's cube there is a lot of different consideration. So it will be work that we\u2019ll continue to for a while. Luke Montgomery : This is the fourth quarter in a row you provisioned for legal contingencies; I know you can't talk about particulars but just any sense of how far along you are on the need for further provisioning. I don't take this as combative but you excluded from operating basis results, but it's getting to the point of kind of usual or unusual or recurring non-recurring and I think it has an impact in your capital ratio. So any help there will be helpful. Jay Hooley : Let me take a cut at that Lukas, JV. This is the provision relates to the indirect foreign exchange issue that predates 2010 just to put a box around it. And as you noted over the last couple of quarters we've been taking incremental provisions. We believe that we've reached financial terms with the counterparties that we have this deal with. What we haven't done is complete the terms and conditions of the agreement and specific language. We would expect that not only financially but relative to all the agreements that we can reach a conclusion shortly and that we can put this behind us. So I don't know if that helps but we hope that this is from a financial standpoint the end of that issue. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two follow ups, one on just what you're going through Jay, I noticed there was an update to the operational risk model and you know that putting the pieces together it seems like that's probably due to the fact that you're close to an end in FX charges, is that an accurate read across? Mike Bell : Betsy its Mike. It is the case that we did update the operational risk capital model as we typically do once a year, that was updated in Q2 and that was part of the divergence between the improvements on the standardized approach risk based capital ratios and the advanced approach risk based capital ratios. However that is not driven by our own FX settlement discussions, it's driven by a number of other factors including what the industry experience has been historically. Betsy Graseck : And then is the conclusion when you do conclude the FX legal situation there's no further update to the risk model, the operational risk model. Mike Bell : Betsy, the operational risk model in particular has a lot of different moving parts so I wouldn't try to speculate on future updates to that level. But I would remind you that at this point our binding constraint tends to be the standardized approach and I would expect that to be the case for a while. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately follow up on the non-operating deposits. I guess I'm wondering if we could get a little bit of color Jay from the kind of things that clients could do with you to potentially either reduce or bring on, I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but bring on new business that would enable you to potentially change some of the definitions from non operating to operating. For example if it's a broad set of businesses that their folks are doing with you. Jay Hooley : Yes, no, it's really less the latter Betsy, it was, let me just give you a few things. One, I think I mentioned this last call and Mike referenced the SEC is very focused around you know liquidity management and 40 Act and the broader based asset management world and we've introduced a pretty sophisticated tool that allows asset managers to stress their liquidity and so the one way we're helping is we're helping them optimize their own liquidity stress testing which sometimes adds to their liquidity sometimes reduces their liquidity needs. But with regard to the conversations it's usually around can we sweep some of the deposits, can we use repo facility. It gets into that level of how do we move deposits out of pure cash which end up on our balance sheet. And there are handful of approaches and depending on the customer and their view of required liquidity in capital we have different outlets. Probably the most important thing that I would leave you with is these are constructive conversations where you know our customers as we would help them, they're looking to help us so it's not contentious it's just how can we do, how can we move these deposits and do it on a sustainable basis. So at period ends we tend to get spikes in deposits we want to manage those down but we're really looking for some more durable sustainable solutions which will allow us to manage these things and control them over time. The last point I would make is that you know pricing has always, usually a pretty good way to create behavior and in Europe around the Euro we've introduced pricing, I think we've moved it up three times, it feels like we're reaching that point of equilibrium where it has a cost associated with using our balance sheet and therefore our customers are more sensitive to the cost so we're thinking about not only cost on a ongoing basis but also think about kind of surge pricing that you know if deposits were to go past a certain point the cost of using our balance sheet would go up by a lot and so those discussions and those mechanisms are starting to give us, one we're having better conversations and I think that we are you know likely to improve our situation with regard to excess deposits. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you just reconcile two thoughts on the one end you are the port in the storm, your source are strength in Europe, your earnings assets were up 3% every three months, and on the other end, NIR declined and you expect that to perhaps go lower. Is that all due to the excess deposit issue or is there something else going on to? Mike Bell : So Mike its Mike. Related to Europe, yeah it is the case that we are viewed as a safe haven in Europe and that certainly is a significant contributor to the increase in the deposit base that we saw in Q2 relative to Q1. I mean another issue though is just that the lack of good alternatives for our European clients which relates to your second point and that is that the interest rate environment they are generally along with the credit environment is not particularly attractive. So there is downward pressure on our own NIR related to the assets that back the European deposits. One another point I would note, Jay was talking earlier about a specific client discussions in Europe, I would note that where we've had additional success with some clients in Europe relates to encouraging them through discussions but also with the implied lever of pricing to move out of cash deposits on our balance sheet into for example short-term government bonds and I would expect that over time we'll see more of that movement in Europe for all the reasons that I just mentioned. Mike Mayo : I mean your peers also had earnings asset growth but NIR was higher whereas Euro was down. Is it relates just the degree that you are in Europe that's the difference? Or anything else? Mike Bell : Yes, again Mike I don\u2019t like to really speculate on our competitive results. My interpretation of the comparison that you are drawing here is more from the starting point as oppose to some fundamental difference in mix. And therefore our outlook has really remained relatively unchanged throughout this year in terms of NIR. And I -- it's for all the reasons that we've talked about. We expect that excess deposits to come off in addition until we do get a meaningful improvement in market interest rates. We're going to continue to be negatively impacted by this grind of the turnover in our portfolio. Those dynamics have not changed. Mike Mayo : And that you lowered your NIR upper end of your range just a little bit. Is that right? Mike Bell : That\u2019s correct, that's mainly driven by our view now that it is unlikely that the Bank of England will raise rates in August. If you recall that was one of the assumptions that we had applied in the rising interest rate scenario at the Investor Day. We think that is unlikely to happen at least in August and that\u2019s really the primary reason for the drop in the very upper end of the positive -- environment range. Mike Mayo : And last one, NIR, so you have 62 billion of excess deposits you plan on reducing that. That reduction is in the updated NIR guidance. You're just not telling us how much excess deposit reduction you expect to have for competitive end client? Mike Mayo : That is correct Mike and again we have a range built in there as you can imagine because we don\u2019t have a crystal ball and exactly how much they're going to decline but we do have a decline build in there. Operator Your next will come from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Question for you on expenses. So, maybe just there is a couple of moving pieces obviously, but help us understand how we should I guess think about dollar terms for the back half of the year given the fact that second quarter expense growth was a little bit 20 basis points year-over-year versus the revenue growth which is obviously below kind of your 200 basis points. I get the fact on a year-to-date basis you guys are still looking pretty good. But just kind of curious to see where is their flexibility in the model on the expense front into the back half of the year to help you achieve that 200 basis points plus? Mike Mayo : Sure, I mean the short answer is that it really does depend upon a handful of important factors. One is of course the overall level of net new business that we add in the second half of the year that will directly tie the level of expense that we need to add to service that additional revenues that would be one. Second as I mentioned earlier we do have work underway on the existing regulatory initiatives to work to replace outside consulting expenses with full time staff to the extent of possible and so our success rate there will be a key factor. And then lastly, importantly we are looking at some additional expense actions literally as we speak and I would expect to be in a position to provide a more public update at our Q3 earnings call but we are looking at some additional expense actions to see what else can be done improve the overall productivity level beyond the regulatory piece that I mentioned. Alex Blostein : And I guess the comments you guys are making around replacing consultants for full-time staff. When you go through the analysis on and are much spending on consultant versus how much it would cost you bringing in full-time headcount. What\u2019s the net benefit to pretax earnings from doing so? Mike Mayo : I'd really prefer not to try to give you a specific number at this point. Again it's fair to say that we do have some of that benefit built into our overall second half of the year expectations but I'd rather prefer -- rather not disaggregate specific number from our overall thinking. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Just a quick follow-up I's sorry to be the dead horse on the balance sheet, but ABS was down 7 billion period end that\u2019s a pretty significant increase versus the sort of 2 billion a quarter that you have been doing in the prior year so is that are we getting closer to the end of the rebalancing for the LCR or is there still lot more to do in the ABS side. I am just trying to get a sense of as the NIM compression going to start to be slow a little bit if that is done? Mike Bell : Jim its Mike. First, at this point I expect that it is unlikely that we would have another material transaction that would shrink the ABS portfolio along the lines of what we did in Q2. I think that\u2019s unlikely to happen in the second half of the year. But as I mentioned this optimization work is going to go on for a while. So I wouldn't at this point foreclose the additional actions for example in 2016 along those lines. Again remember that you've got these longer-term objectives it's not just the 2015 objective, we've got these longer-term objectives of strengthening our overall capital ratios and reducing the mark-to-market sensitivities that impact CCAR from as part of just our overall ROE improvement both of those objectives are important and really are somewhat separate from the near-term needs for LCR compliance. Jim Mitchell : But can you give us any help on timing and amount of additional mix shift? Mike Bell : Again Jim I think that the mix shift will continue for several quarters, and again importantly that is factored into the NIR range that we gave in our prepared remarks. Jim Mitchell : And then maybe just a quick follow-up with the guidelines from the Fed and they said SLR will not be part of the next CCAR. Does that some of the pressure off in terms of give you more time to think about how entire potentially higher interest rates effects deposits and takes the pressure off on the comfort side, can you give it another year to see how things progress or do you still have to kind of build in a glide path. Mike Bell : Jim you are absolutely right that was helpful to us probably to helpful to others as well that the NPR that was released around the 2016 CCAR indicated that SLR would not be part of the process for this year that is in fact helpful. I would point out though that tier 1 leverage was to constraint at this past CCAR and that remains an important consideration for the next CCA, so it's certainly means to that it's still very important that we pay attention to the non-operational deposits as it relates to the capital for next year and any potential pref issuance in particular. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Adam Beatty : Question on the pipeline and backlog in asset servicing, it looks like the backlog were to be installed came down somewhat in the quarter. Does that create kind of a natural bias for higher servicing revenue subject of course to markets and currencies and also looks like the win rate ticked down a little bit do you expect that to normalize? Jay Hooley : Sure, let me take that one, this is Jay. On the pipeline more broadly nothing really has changed its robust, its diverse, there is activity I just gone through over the last six weeks I've been on all continents and visited 15 different offices and there is a lot of activity that I think is stimulated by constrained environment compliance and regulatory. So pipelines are solid. For the quarter we committed I think it was 143 billion and massive, that was a little low relative to what we've been running probably last couple of years we've been in the 200 billion to 300 billion range. I wouldn't read into it, I think just some other stuff this timing. So no read through there. With regard to I think at the beginning of your question, we've got 174 billion I think that sounds right of assets that has committed that have not yet installed and I'm looking around the table, I think that\u2019s about where we've been historically. So the relationship between pipeline, kind of a funnel what we win and how we implement seems pretty steady. I would say in the 174 and in the 143 there aren\u2019t big lumpy two year implantations, which will delay revenue, so we should expect a pretty steady stream of service fee revenue that would trickle out of those kind of few factors. Mike Bell : Adam its Mike, the only other thing I would add is you noted our GS revenue was strong in the quarter relative to both Q1 as well as a year ago and certainly we've gotten good contribution, we got contribution in Q2 from the net new business piece of it. Adam Beatty : Also, on the asset management in terms of some of the redemptions in past, we've heard a couple of times this quarter about international and sovereign clients maybe having some liquidity needs based on lower commodity prices. What's your outlook on that given where things are right now and given what you're hearing from your clients? Is there a potential for an additional draw down there or is that pretty much over in? Jay Hooley : I think that if you look at oil prices as probably maybe the biggest single driver of that, you know the, I don't know what your outlook for you know, crude is but it feels to me like was an adjustment from over a $100 a barrel to $50 a barrel as opposed to months and time kind of adjustment. So I wouldn't expect there would be big additional outflows, I don't know I mean I think it's unlikely oil will go lower and therefore it feels more like a one-time adjustment versus something that we're going to see every quarter. Operator : And your next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : So first question on FX, revenues looked light versus peers and just wanted to, I don\u2019t know whether there's a connection here but we saw the FX revenues come in a bit late and then we continue to see these FX charges ratchet and the discussion is ongoing. Is it possible that there's a connection there? Jay Hooley : No, no connection at all Bren, you know if you look at -- we track as you'd expect pretty closely the indirect FX, the direct FX, the platform FX and all pretty steady as she goes, I think the -- you know it's hard to make any judgment on a quarter, I think if back at Investor Day I don't know if you recall this, but we showed our FX performance in absolute terms versus the near end peers both electronic and directly traded and it's quite a bit higher than on an absolute basis. And I think if you stretch back over a couple two or three quarters and look at trends you would see our FX performance is good as if not better than the peers. So nothing really in the quarter and certainly no connection between these litigation discussions which are historical and our customers understand that, have had no influence on indirect FX which is where if it had influence it would have influence. Brennan Hawken : And then maybe a bit more of a broad or strategic question on expenses. You know certainly this is not easy times for large financial services companies and GSIBs but you could argue that higher regulatory expense pressure is not really environmental but now it's just part of the new operating landscape rather than being a transient factor. And I know you referenced that you're looking to do a few things, later in the year, so clearly that's not lost on you but you know, I sense from conversations with investors that there's increasing frustration on a lack of push on the expense front. The revenue kind of is what it is, expenses are bit more in your control, why is it, can you help us understand why there hasn't been more movement on the expense front. Jay Hooley : Yes, let me start that one and then Mike can maybe jump in. So first off I agree with your point of view that the regulatory compliance is a structural shift and I think most firms are trying to deal with the immediacy and then the ongoing nature of, how no idea comply with these things but how do you comply with these things in a highly automated way which is the kind of way we would look at anything at State Street. So we've got a combination of addressing that with you know manpower, consultants, individuals but ultimately want to apply technology and drive down the cost of complying not only for ourselves but as a service to our customers. But let me just introduce another front which is maybe what the comment that Mike made few cycles ago. You know we went through the five year IT and Ops transformation plan and I think it was, it set us up nicely. You've heard me talk about the fact that we\u2019ve had great core discipline around core systems, we haven't drifted to multiple systems and we\u2019ve taken those common systems and improved the processes and we've leveraged work sites, China, Poland at all, we continue to do that. There's an ongoing opportunity now that we've moved in that direction to continue to apply technology to replace labor and so you know part of what has underpinned the last year have been the regulatory and compliance cost offset by some of the operational improvements that we're making which is really a fine technology to reduce labor. There is much more opportunity to do more there, so what we're thinking about is the way to accelerate some of that activity to do more assistance to accelerate the minimization of the labor content and the work output, if I can say that way. And we view that and we have viewed that as something that's ongoing because we don\u2019t believe among that the regulatory compliance pressure lets up and we don\u2019t know when the top line environment gets better. So the thing we can control is the expenses, so we've in the background been continuing to invest in technology to improve our operational efficiency but the question is can we do more; can we accelerate some of that activity. If that helps? Operator : And our last question will come from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Starting with some of the regulatory type issues that is being going on with BSA, AML and then with the Wells notice but you received I think relating to still lobbying around the pensions business. Are those having any impact on growth and that new generation you kind of have to focus a bit more internally rather than externally and going out and winning new business? Jay Hooley : Yes, fair question Geoffrey. I would say no, pretty directly the AML, BSA activity is -- we were criticized for not having the level of process that the regulators expected and wanted us to have so we have -- and we've been at this for 18 months. It's a pretty segregated activity that we're conducting country-by-country, business-by-business and so it's pretty content, it's got project plans, it's managed separately from the business line. So I really don\u2019t think this going hinder our ability to grow the revenue line and on the Wells notice reference which again is kind of pre 2012 reference to acquisition of pension retirement plans using consultants and again we are working through that. We've got a different point of view than others on that but it doesn\u2019t, it hasn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t affect any revenue generation. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just a quick follow up on something you said earlier. You mentioned the [GSIP] buffers as a fact that it feeds into the walk around non-operational deposits. Is it all that to come down from 150 bps to 100 bps and so how much you need to do get yourself into the lower bucket? Mike Bell : Geoffrey, its Mike. There are a number of different nuances with the final rule that just came out on Monday. So I think it's a little bit early to give you a specific number but it's not lost of us that the increased excess deposits over the last couple of years is the single biggest factor driving our [GSIP] surcharge up and therefore I just -- it's a really -- it increases what was already a priority. It increases the importance of reducing those. Now again, some of that will happen from our actions. We think some of that will happen naturally as market interest rates rise but it does increase the importance of that work. I think it's the most important thing I wouldn\u2019t leave you for this way. I think that a 150 basis points [GSIP] surcharge by itself is manageable but again there are -- number one, we would obviously like to have reduce the as the piece that's related to the excess deposits and just more of an incentive to get that accomplish. Jay Hooley : And just to be clear for everybody on the call that it's our expectation as if we do that and 150 or whatever it is vary. So there will be recalibration of that. So there is a motivation incentive to draw deposits down. Operator : Thank you and that was our final question. I'll turn the conference call back over to management for closing remarks. Jay Hooley : Yes Holly just a quick thanks to everybody for their attention and we look forward to speaking you after the third quarter. Thanks. Operator : Once again we'd like to thank you for your participation on today's State Street's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As a result, we currently expect to release our 4Q 2015 results on Wednesday, January 27, 2016. Additionally, please save the date for our 2016 Investor Day, which is currently scheduled for Wednesday, February 24, at the Mandarin Hotel in New York City. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone. Our performance in the third quarter was impacted by the sharp decline in global equity markets, including a more pronounced decline in emerging markets. While I'm not pleased with the negative effect on our earnings during the quarter, I do believe that over the long-term our relatively higher exposure to global equities in emerging markets will benefit us. In light of the continued challenging environment, we are accelerating our multiyear plan to further digitize our operating environment and create cost efficiencies. The plan follows on our successful Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. We are targeting savings that are in the range of approximately $500 million when fully implemented over a four- to five-year timeframe, which is similar to the duration of our recently completed Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. Mike will provide additional details on our plan in his comments. As many aspects of the new regulatory landscape are taking shape, we're moving aggressively to position ourselves to comply. An example of this during the quarter was the significant progress we made in decreasing excess deposits on our balance sheet. Despite the market environment during the third quarter, we were able to advance our core business, growing operating basis fee revenue by 4% and 1%, compared to the nine months and quarter ending September 30, 2014, respectively and adding $141 billion of new servicing commitments during the third quarter. We continue to emphasize returning capital to our shareholders. During the third quarter of 2015, we purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock and at quarter-end had approximately $1.1 billion remaining on our March 2015 common stock purchase program, authorizing the share of up to $1.8 billion of our common stock through June 30, 2016. Now, I'd like to provide a brief overview of economic and market developments and how our business is affected. Concerns about global growth became more acute in the third quarter of 2015 with declines in emerging market growth rates, notably China, further degradation in commodity prices, and even the previously solid economic performance in the U.S. showing signs of hesitation. Equity markets became more correlated as a result. Gyrations in Chinese equity markets, which had been ignored earlier in the year, began to impact markets more broadly. Global equity markets posted their worst quarter since the third quarter of 2011, which was exacerbated by double-digit depreciation in many emerging market currencies, reflecting investment outflows from those markets. A modicum of calm has recently returned in October following the Federal Reserve's September decision to not raise interest rates amid weaker global conditions and accompanying financial stress. With the risk of deflation returning, investors now question whether U.S. monetary policy tightening will begin at all this year. Together these events and trends impact our business in several meaningful ways. First, the lower equity markets have caused our assets under custody and administration and assets under management to decrease. This decline in assets combined with the associated risk-off sentiment has resulted in lower fee revenue. Second, the low interest rate environment continues to negatively impact our net interest revenue and net interest margin. This is in part driven by our higher-yielding portfolio investments maturing or experiencing prepayments. And then those funds being reinvested in lower-yielding investments. Now, I'd like to discuss our Asset Servicing and Asset Management business. We added $141 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. New assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods totaled $195 billion at September 30. And we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines. Our Asset Management business experienced net outflows of $29 billion during the third quarter of 2015, driven primarily by net outflows of $42 billion from institutional mandates, partially offset by $10 billion of inflows to ETFs. The significant drivers of passive equity outflows include rebalancing and cash needs of some of our clients due to lower commodity prices, which is a continuation of a trend that we saw in the second quarter, as well as an expected redemption from one large client. The SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF, which is an active equity income ETF launched in partnership with DoubleLine, has gained further momentum. It has attracted $1.2 billion in net flows post-launch and now ranks as the most successful ETF launched in the U.S. this year. Additionally during the third quarter, we launched another 13 new ETFs, bringing our year-to-date new launches to 22. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we will open the call to all of your questions. Mike? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I will comment on significant items, which affected our third quarter 2015 GAAP basis results as highlighted on slide four. First, we recorded an after-tax charge of $47 million related to severance for targeted staff reductions. This measure was taken to better calibrate the company's expenses to the current environment and will involve a gross and net worldwide reduction of approximately 600 and 200 positions respectively. We expect these staff reductions to be completed by the end of 2016 with projected expense savings of $50 million with approximately 75% of the savings to positively impact 2016 results. Second, we recorded an after-tax gain of $49 million from the sale of commercial real estate acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. And lastly, we recorded a tax benefit of $59 million related to a reduction of an Italian deferred tax liability as a consequence of our European legal entity restructuring activities. Now, I'll refer to slide seven for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. The 3Q 2015 results primarily reflect the challenges from the declining global equity markets and persistently low market interest rates, as well as the seasonal decline in securities finance in comparison to the second quarter. 3Q 2015 EPS of $1.16 decreased from 2Q 2015 and from the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date EPS decreased slightly compared to the same period a year ago. Importantly, compared to the year-ago period, year-to-date total fee revenue increased 3.7%. 3Q 2015 total fee revenue increased 1% from the third quarter of 2014 and decreased 3% from 2Q 2015, primarily reflecting the adverse market conditions. Compared to the year-ago period, year-to-date fee revenue was negatively impacted by $212 million from the stronger U.S. dollar, largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. Regarding capital, in 3Q 2015, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. Lastly, we're pleased that we made progress on a key priority to reduce the level of deposits on our balance sheet. So moving to slide eight, year-to-date fee revenue increased 3.7%, while expenses increased 2.8% versus a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, year-to-date fee revenue increased 7.2%. Turning to slide 10, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue for 3Q 2015. Servicing fees were down from 3Q 2014, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets, partially offset by net new business and higher transaction volumes. While the EAFE equity index was down approximately 7%, our 3Q 2015 servicing fees were particularly impacted by the 15% sequential decline in emerging-market average daily levels. We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets. 3Q 2015 management fees decreased relative to a year ago, primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, lower performance fees and lower international equity markets. Total trading services revenue in 3Q 2015 increased from 3Q 2014 due to the higher foreign exchange trading revenue, reflecting higher volatility in volumes. And compared to 2Q 2015, trading services revenue increased due to higher direct foreign exchange trading revenue. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q 2014, primarily due to new business in enhanced custody, and was lower than 2Q 2015 reflecting seasonality. Processing fees and other revenue increased from the year-ago period and sequentially, primarily due to the impact of certain valuation adjustments and higher revenue from bank-owned life insurance. Moving now to slide 11, as you can see, our operating basis net interest revenue continued to be pressured due to the prolonged low interest rate environment and our success in the third quarter in reducing client deposits. The decline in deposits during the third quarter largely occurred towards the end of the quarter, thus explaining the smaller decline in the average deposit balances quarter-over-quarter versus the period end balances quarter-over-quarter. Now, let's turn to slide 12 to review third quarter 2015 operating basis expenses. Total operating basis expenses decreased slightly from 2Q 2015. Other expenses included a recovery from certain Lehman Brothers claims, which was largely offset by a single securities processing loss of $38 million, which resulted in total securities processing costs for 3Q 2015 of $41 million. This loss was a specific event, and we've evaluated its nature and are implementing control enhancements to mitigate recurrence. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, compensation and benefits expenses increased, reflecting increased costs for new hires to support new business and regulatory initiatives, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower incentive compensation expense. Information systems and communications expenses increased over both periods, reflecting increased cost to support new business and additional data center capacity. Other expenses increased from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher professional services fees, including costs to support regulatory initiatives, as well as higher securities processing costs, partially offset by the third quarter 2015 Lehman recovery and lower charitable contributions. Turning to slide 13. We note that we continue to reposition our balance sheet. The size of the average investment portfolio decreased by approximately $9 billion from June 30 of 2015. The majority of the decrease was related to the sale of lower-yielding MBS and ABS, partially offset by the increase in U.S. treasuries. Now, I'll turn to slide 14 to review our capital position. As you can see, our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. At September 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio under the Basel III fully phased-in standardized approach increased from June 30, principally due to lower credit risk. The fully phased-in holding company supplementary leverage ratio increased to 5.4% on a fully phased-in basis, principally due to our success in reducing client deposits. Now, I'll address a question that's likely on investors' and analysts' minds, and that's to provide an update on our efforts to reduce client deposits including the total reduction level that we're targeting. Throughout third quarter 2015, we engaged in productive discussions with clients regarding the implications for our balance sheet associated with excess deposits. While overall deposits declined approximately $44 billion during the quarter, some of that reflected a lower deposit spike at the third quarter end. Importantly, excluding the deposit spikes at quarter-end, we estimate that our balances were $30 billion to $35 billion lower at the end of the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and we view this deposit reduction effort as successful. Nevertheless, it's also important to recognize that the external environment can impact deposit levels in the future. And our average fourth quarter balance sheet will be the starting point for our 2016 CCAR submission. In addition, as interest rates increase, we also expect to see further declines in client deposits. Turning to slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook for 2015. Primarily due to the third quarter 2015 steep decline in equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, we likely will fall below the previously communicated 4% to 7% growth of operating basis fees in 2015. The continued strength of the U.S. dollar has contributed to downward pressure on fee revenue growth as well. Given the weakness in fee revenue, it will be more challenging for us to grow 2015 operating basis total fee revenue at least 200 basis points above the 2015 growth of operating basis expenses. While this quarter's severance action will have an immaterial impact on operating basis expenses within 4Q 2015, overall we do expect that 4Q 2015 operating basis expenses will be lower than 3Q 2015 levels. For full-year 2015 operating basis net interest revenue, we currently expect to be near the lower end of our previously communicated range of $2.16 billion to $2.22 billion. Our expectation to be near the lower end of the range primarily reflects both the successful effort in reducing excess deposits and continued low market interest rates. Now, I'd like to add some additional detail to Jay's comments on the next stage of our transformation program to digitize our enterprise. To be clear, our objectives are twofold. First, we intend to make further significant reductions in our cost structure. And second, we plan to digitize our interfaces with our clients in order to deliver more value. We've decided to accelerate the next stage of this work through the execution of a formal multiyear plan along the lines of the recently completed and successful Business Operations and Information Technology Transformation Program. While we are still finalizing the details of this second phase of work, we anticipate targeting at least $500 million of annual expense savings when fully implemented. Importantly, the program will likely involve restructuring costs and investments to fully implement the plan and capture the savings, just as the business ops and information technology transformation program did. The specific timeframe and other parameters are still under development and we look forward to providing a further update on our 4Q 2015 earnings call and review of the detail at our Investor Day on February 24, 2016. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike. And, Stephanie, we are now available to open the line to questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question is from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. I think last quarter you gave or \u2013 are you declined to give a target on the amount of excess deposits you hope to shed, but you did say you had a range in mind. Was the decline within that range? And what does that indicate about your potential need for incremental preferred issuance? And then I think you said deposits declined $35 billion adjusted for the lower quarter end spike, so where do excess deposits stand now? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Luke, it's Mike. First of all, one clarification before answering your specific question and that is that we estimate that the deposits if you exclude the quarter end spike were actually down $30 billion to $35 billion. So something in that range of $30 billion to $35 billion rather than explicitly $35 billion. But to answer the main part of your question, first, specifically, yes we're pleased with the progress that we made. We did in fact hit the objective that we had for full year 2015 as of the point in time into the quarter \u2013 third quarter 2015. Now, I would point out in reference to your pref question, the main priority we're focused on here is positioning for the next CCAR. So the 2016 CCAR will likely be our near-term binding constraint and will likely be the most important factor in terms of pref issuance in the near-term. And if you recall our CCAR results from the last go-round, the Tier 1 leverage was our binding constraint and it's likely to be our binding constraint again. So as you can imagine, very helpful to reduce deposits by $30 billion to $35 billion in terms of meeting the near term Tier 1 leverage target. So in terms of your specific question on the prefs, I do expect that in first quarter of 2016, we'll look at a number of different factors. We'll look at the parameters of the CCAR test. We'll look at the balance sheet for the average fourth quarter 2015 because remember it's not the September 30 balance sheet. It's the average balance sheet over fourth quarter 2015 that's going to be so important in terms of the next CCAR. So, again, maintaining the lower level through fourth quarter is a high priority. But basically, we'll look at all of those things in 2016 and then make some decisions on any pref issuance plans for 2016. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Luke, let me just if I can since I know excess deposits such \u2013 is a meaningful question and issue in your minds. Let me just open that, widen that question a little bit. We've been on at least a year journey with our customers. And I think what's transpired through that is that, one, we've developed a very accurate sense of what's operational and what's excess. We define who the outliers are, we've engaged in conversation around those discussions. We have helped customers facilitate transition to money funds out of treasury products. And we've used fees in order to encourage the right behavior. And so regardless of whether we're at where we want to be in the fourth quarter, what's to me more important is that the dialogue is clear and open and we found a lever that is in charging fees on excess deposits, which I believe will allow us to control excess deposits and manage the size of our balance sheet more proactively going forward. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then you provided, I think, a very detailed model-friendly plan with the first phase of the business transformation initiative. I think you said that's forthcoming, but at this point, are you prepared to speak to any detail? What is multiyear plan mean? Will the savings be frontend or backend loaded? Do you anticipate a bottom-line impact? Or is this just offsetting the growth rate of expenses? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me start that, Luke, and Mike can weigh in. As you recall, the business ops and IT transformation program we set milestones and timelines to demonstrate to you that we were getting the saves that we anticipated getting, and we would anticipate a similar kind of layout going forward. We don't have \u2013 we have that detail internally but we haven't translated it into something that we can clearly articulate to you. But let me just again wind that one back because, I think, it will be the source of probably a series of questions during this morning's call. Business Operations and IT Transformation largely created standardization, centralization and we took advantage of lower labor costs. If you look at business ops and IT transformation, I equate it to 70% of the benefit was gained from, I would say, process improvement and labor cost arbitrage, 30% technology. Now that we've taken that first step, what we announced today is something that we have been planning, but the new news is that we've accelerated given the difficult environment. And largely it involves digitizing that interface for the customers, so everything comes into us electronically. And then from an end-to-end basis, as information flows into us on the front end, it flows all the way through our systems without human intervention, and then out the other side for data analytics purposes. So in this next phase, I think the mix is more like 70% or 80% technology-enabled automation, and 20% or 30% process and/or labor arbitrage. So I think \u2013 I'll hand it over to Mike in a minute, but we will, beginning fourth-quarter call and then more extensively at the February 24 Investor Meeting, walk you through the plans, the details, the milestones and what you should look to us for on a periodic basis for updates. Mike, do you want to add anything to that? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it was a complete answer, Jay. The only piece, Luke, I would add is we are working through the details here, so this would be the pacing details. This would be the details around the required investments and likely charges. I know that several of you are going to be interested in what does this mean for full-year 2016? So it's really \u2013 that level of detail is what I'd, as Jay said, we're working through those specifics right now in the format that I know you're interested in. So that's the piece that'll be forthcoming at fourth quarter and also at the February Investor Day. Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi, there. I guess just a follow-up to that is the markets can move up and down and as we've seen already in October, markets are up 8% to10%. So curious on a sidebar, how much do you think of the weakness in third quarter you might already have recouped some of that benefit in October if markets stayed here? And then the second part of it is much more important is similar to Luke's, how much of it falls to the bottom line. Should we be, is an easier question or harder question to ask you, where should margins be for your business? In other words, down to 28.9% is below where you've been historically with these various cost programs, ops and IT and now this one. Is there a goal to be riding at a certain level? Like how are you going to measure profitability for yourselves in the next couple of years? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Glenn. It's Mike. Good morning. First on your first question on the markets, it's certainly a positive that markets have rebounded month-to-date here in October. I would point out just for completeness that emerging markets now are pretty close on a month-to-date basis back to the third quarter average. They had really dipped in late September, and what's particularly important to us is the average over the whole quarter. So I would \u2013 I'd hesitate to try to claim any kind of victory based on the first three weeks of October, and obviously we've got another couple months to go. But I would agree with you that it's certainly been helpful to see the equity market positive news on the first three weeks of the month. Jay, do you want to talk about the? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me attempt to take that one on, Glenn. The digitization plan which we're announcing today of approximately $500 million in savings over a four year to five year period should obviously help our ongoing goal of annual operating leverage. And all else equal, will improve the margin. If everything else was held steady, the margin would improve. We all know that markets are markets and rates are rates and we don't always control that, so in addition to demonstrating for you that this change will improve the margin, the other thing that we look at, probably more importantly internally, is we look at unit costs. When you apply technology to a manual process, we've got excruciating detail around the unit cost of all of the activities that we conduct and when you apply technology and reduce labor, couple things happen. One, you improve quality of the customers, you reduce risk, the operating risk that we talk about today. If you're automating, you're not going to have that kind of stuff. And importantly to all of us here, it reduced costs. So for me, it's looking at the unit costs and making sure that we're reducing those unit costs steadily over time. But again, everything else held constant, the margin should improve. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Understood. And it is a small thing, but is the $50 million in annualized savings from the head count actions you took part of the $500 million, or is that a separate? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That is separate. That is explicit to this quarters actions we took. The $500 million is incremental to the $50 million. Glenn Paul Schorr - Evercore ISI : Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, Mike, for you on the NII front. So on an ex-rates basis, if we're at the kind of low end of the $2.16 billion, we're exiting the year just above maybe $510 million on NII in that circumstance. I think \u2013 I guess if you could just help us understand as you look ahead on an ex-rates basis when would you anticipate NII starting to stabilize out? I know the NIM will be a function as we saw this quarter of the excess deposit flows here and there, but when you're thinking about net interest revenue dollars, how do you start to think about seeing that through on an ex-rates basis? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Ken. Good morning. First of all, it's largely dependent, Ken, as you can imagine, on what happens in terms of market interest rates, which will be tied very closely to what the Fed does in the near-term in terms of potentially increasing the administered rate. To focus on two different scenarios, if you'll recall at our Investor Day, we had said, look, if you exclude the excess deposits and assume that the Fed funds rate would ultimately get back to 2% and the U.S. Treasury at 10 years would get back to 3.5%, we would expect that the NIM, again, importantly, excluding the excess deposits, would be in the range of 150 basis points to 160 basis points approximately four years after the Fed stopped increasing those rates. Now again, there's a lot of assumptions in there, and all things equal, of course. But that gives you a sense that it could take a while, but it could be a meaningful increase because that 150 basis points to 160 basis points would compare to something in the low 120s basis points today on that same basis. So again, a fair amount of upside that would way more than offset the loss of the NIR from the excess deposits. Conversely, that low 120s basis points could fall to something like 95 basis points to 100 basis points, if you recall at the Investor Day presentation, if interest rates stayed static. So again, unfortunately, a fair amount of downside if rates stay exactly where they are. So it is a relatively unpredictable period, Ken, so I think it would be fair to say in net, it's too early to give you a specific thoughts around calendar year 2016, but in net, there could be continued grind if we don't get help on market interest rates, but we could get help over time if we could get some help there. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. One follow-up on expenses. You're asked about this a lot, just underlying regulatory cost inflation, which has been a big burden of this year. Again, aside from the program, the $50 million to $500 million, what's your line of sight to at least seeing kind of the core rate of growth of expenses starting to slow, or are we still on the upward escalation part of that part of the spend? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Ken. The way I think about it is in really a couple of different pieces. First of all, I would remind you that we're in a service business, so as we add additional net new business, as we have for 2015, I would expect that we'd have to add expenses to service that revenue. But obviously, we expect to get positive operating leverage on that additional revenue. So net-net, the revenue more than pays for the additional expenses. You're absolutely right, the burden that we have faced here in 2015 and also in 2014 was related to the regulatory and related priorities, and that expense came both in terms of adding full-time staff but also outside consultants. As we've talked to you about before, we do anticipate in Q4 and also in 2016 making more progress on replacing those outside consultants, which are very expensive, with additional full-time staff. And just as we've gotten better in terms of process improvement on these priorities, I think we get more efficient and smarter at how we're spending the money. So again, that's been upward pressure in 2014 and 2015. I think we'll be more productive in 2016. I still would anticipate, I wouldn't put a number on it at this point, that 2016 regulatory expenses would be higher than where they ended up for 2015 just based on the overall environment and the higher regulatory expectations worldwide. But I don't think we'll see the magnitude of increase and certainly we're working through the budgeting process to try to limit that year-over-year increase to something less than what it's been here in 2015. And then the only last comment I'd make and then see if Jay, wants to add anything is around we will continue to make additional efficiencies. We've made progress on that in 2015. The severance charge that we're announcing today is obviously, another near-term step, and then as we've laid out today, the significant focus on this multiyear plan to get the next tranche of the transformation savings. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I don't have anything to add, Ken. Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Jay. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I just wanted to dig in a little bit to the deposit strategy and I think it's great that you were able to bring the deposits down. I just wondered, you mentioned client conversations. We've seen the front end of the curve in the auctions and treasuries, go for zero rates. So I'm guessing that's part of the strategy to increase, move deposits or excess cash out maybe to the treasury market. But I'm just wondering what other kinds of discussions or conversations you're having? And how much did the pricing change that you discussed last call impact your success? And do you see pricing continuing from here to have a positive impact on your balances? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me take that one up, Betsy. As I referenced before, this is, I think, probably the most important thing we did was had an extended conversation with customers making sure they understood through our eyes what was excess and what was more burdensome from the capital return standpoint. Once we got there, the customers, they get it. They understand the capital pressure. So it was really then more a matter of what's the execution plan. We had some vehicles within State Street that we're able to utilize to offload or relieve some of those excess deposits. They also chose to use other vehicles. I think the pricing, which I would say in Europe ratchet up three or four times and the U.S. less so, was us feeling our way to determine at what level of cost to the customer for excess deposits, it created the right behavior. So the most important thing was transparency and openness of discussion, facilitating and helping them with alternative strategies for excess deposits, and then reinforcing that with the pricing mechanism, which I think ultimately that combination of things leaves us in a place where our customers appreciate and understand what we're going through and are trying to help us solve the overall issue. And leaves us with, I think, a mechanism in place, i.e. pricing, that should allow us to, within reason, manage the size of our balance sheet. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And do you feel like this is the beginning and there's a lot more to go? Or that you worked really hard, obviously, on this for a while, so you've optimized as much as you think you can optimize with your clients at this stage? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think I would say that, importantly, what we've done is establish some, I'll use the word control or some ability to influence those deposits. And as Mike mentioned, we set our target, which we achieved that target. I think going forward, the size of the deposit base and the burden on the balance sheet will be dictated by CCAR or other internal processes, our view of rates. So we think we're in a pretty good place right now not only from a standpoint of where deposits are but reiterating the importance of how we got there. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. So you're not really looking for that much more shrinkage from here? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Not at this point. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Good morning. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : So I just want to summarize what I think I heard. You're missing your targets for operating leverage and fee growth for 2015. There's a lot of reasons : lower rates, lower markets, lower dollar, lower EM, and higher regulatory costs. And part of the solution is to accelerate the plan to digitalize the operation. So if my understanding is correct, why a total of perhaps five years from now to get the benefits from the plan? I understand you won't tell us all the details until January, but we're talking I guess, the end of 2020 for some of these benefits. And can you reassure us that you guys have a sense of urgency after having less than ideal operating leverage this year? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me start that, Mike, and then Mike can jump in if he chooses. I'd separate those two comments. I mean they're broadly related, but we set out a 4% to 7% revenue growth rate and 200 basis points at the beginning of the year, conditioned upon a certain set of market and rate environment. And as Mike reported, we haven't thrown in the towel on the 200 basis points. I guess that's important to say that we have probably a realistic view of the fourth quarter from a market standpoint. And we believe it's going to be pretty challenging to get to the bottom end of that 4% to 7% growth range. But we are turning over every rock in the fourth quarter to attempt to hit that 200 basis points. We're just saying it looks like a stretch as I sit here today. Related but separately, you know as well as anybody the business ops and IT journey that we went on, and I think you have an appreciation of the foundation that set for us. Digitization is the next logical step in that journey. And we had the digitization plan, but in light of the continued downward pressure on the environment, I've decided that we're going to accelerate that forward, we're going to put more emphasis, more resources on it and get to that $500 million quicker than we would have had we not. When 70% of the improvement is technology-driven, there is some gate for how quickly you can go but what we're saying is we are going to make it the highest priority in the organization to accelerate that plan. And we think that it will have the attended benefits of cost, which we're all interested in. But it's also going to accelerate our ability to deliver data analytics products to our customers as we streamline the internal data flow within the organization, reduce risk, and reduce operating loss. I think what we're saying is tough third quarter based on the environment, haven't given up on our goals for 2015, but given our overall outlook for the environment, we're moving forward a plan that we had in place anyway to accelerate our ability to reduce costs. Mike, do you want to add anything? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Mike, I would just add that, remember, this is built off of the backbone of the IT and ops transformation program, which I think everybody would view as being very successful. That also was a multiyear plan but the fact that we were able to meet the interim as well as the full program objectives there, gives us a lot of confidence that we can do the same for this next tranche. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : And then just one short follow-up. On page three of your slide, it says long-term shareholder value and it gives long-term goals, certainly not for this environment. Might you have to reconsider those long-term goals at some point? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Mike, I would say that we'll certainly each year continue to look at the long-term expectations that we have for this business. For now, certainly \u2013 and we went through this, if you recall, at our last Investor Day, we do believe that those goals are achievable as long as in particular that we get some help in terms of a return to more normal interest rates and the other items that we talked about at \u2013 backing those goals back in February. Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey. Good morning. Just maybe a quick question on the SLR. As you pointed out, a lot of the deposit declines came at the end of the quarter. So as we look to 4Q, since the SLR denominator is based on an average, if I do the math right, based on your indications, does that add \u2013 should we expect that that adds, all else being equal, around it seems like maybe 40 basis points to the SLR next quarter? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Jim, it's Mike. Yeah, certainly your arithmetic is in the ballpark. I would remind you that the \u2013 that implies that we continue in terms of those, the lower levels of deposit through the entirety of the average of fourth quarter, and also that nothing else materially changes. But again, subject to those caveats, your arithmetic is on the money. We'll get the benefit of the drop in the deposits in September, we'll get the full benefit of that in Q4 as long as it's maintained. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. So when we think about the conversation around preferred, you're reticent to kind of say that it's off the table, it's just because you don't know how it progresses from here. If we see another spike in the balance sheet, that might be a different discussion, but given that you could be getting much closer to 6%, it seems like there's a clear guide path to above 6% over the next couple of years. Is that a fair comment? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Jim, yeah, I'd split it up into two pieces. First, your comments are fair as it relates to the SLR, and in fact, we've said all along that we are confident that we're going to be in compliance with SLR, which doesn't kick in until 1/1/2018, and that we'll be on a glide path to get there. So, yes, I continue to feel positive about our longer-term compliance with SLR. I would reinforce, though, Jim, what I said earlier, and that is near-term, the most important binding constraint is not the SLR, it's the upcoming CCAR test, and specifically based on our experience last year, it's the Tier 1 leverage calculation in the upcoming CCAR that's likely to be our near-term binding constraint. And I'm sure, that's going to be impacted by our Q4 balance sheet, but it's also going to be impacted by the parameters of the CCAR test. We don't know what those are yet, obviously, and we'll have to investigate those parameters and put it through our own capital management modeling. So there are just a lot of other things that \u2013 beyond the longer-term SLR compliance that could go into a decision in 2016 around prefs, and I just, I \u2013 not knowing those parameters, I can't say definitively, but obviously we plan to give an update here in \u2013 at the beginning of 2016. James F. Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, folks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Jay, just to take a step back on the business ops transformation program and your digitization program, just big picture, I guess, moving from the former program where you certainly had a technological lead versus your peers, and then to this program, is this something that in your mind was an evolution that you thought would have to happen even several years back, or is it more in a response to an increasingly competitive environment? Of course, BNY advanced their technological move a couple of years back, post the integration of Mellon, and just trying to get a sense of the competitive environment that's causing this versus how you feel about your leadership position? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, let me give that a shot, Brian. The \u2013 I think it represents the inevitable endgame for this business, which is increasingly what we do even though we value some of the operational activities and pricing that we do at the end of the day. The value that the customer sees is the information and analytics that gets derived from all of the data and accounting that we do internally here. And that is impeded today for everybody by multiple systems, breaks, handoffs, reconciliations which causes an inherent delay in the information which lessens its usability. So not far into the future, I think we end up being the organization that delivers upstream analytics to portfolio managers, to risk managers, to compliance managers that provide that real-time insight into the information we hold on behalf of our customers. So that's where the puck's going. I think everybody is grappling with this in different ways. We have the good fortune, you could say good fortune or good management, to begin with common systems. And so the common systems that we had going into the business opts and IT transformation program allowed us to look at the common processes, which are many, go through a lean or Six Sigma type analysis, optimize those processes, form centers of excellence, leverage places like Poland, China, India for a low-cost location. And that's where we are today. So we run common systems. We've got common processes. The next leg of that is to automate from an end to end basis when a trade comes into the organization, all the way through and out the back end. How that marries up with where the puck's going is that if you can do that, then that information becomes real-time \u2013 all the processing that goes on and the information we deliver back up to front offices of our customers \u2013 is much more valuable than it is today. And if you were to visit with any asset owner, any asset manager, and ask them what's on their top three list of challenges today, it's aggregating data on a real-time basis for insights, for portfolio management, risk management, and compliance. And we aim to be the organization to get there. And you can't get there unless you take these steps that I just outlined. And I would say from a standpoint of where we are from a leadership standpoint, common systems, common processes, leveraging emerging markets all over the world. And the next big step is to digitize end-to-end those activities. I think we're out in front of everybody with regard to that. And I think we've got the right vision and view. And this is just saying we're going to further accelerate the execution to make sure that we deliver on an organization that's better situated for where the future opportunities are, and an organization that will continue to be a cost leader from a standpoint of those core activities that we conduct. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great color. Thanks very much for that. And then, Mike, just some couple of clarifications. Just your comments around the 120 basis point NIM, excluding excess deposits. What type of an environment do you need to get to that? And if you could just comment again. I think I may have missed this. The actual excess deposit level you have now, now that you've got $30 billion to $35 billion off. And then on regulatory expenses, you mentioned the pace slowing in 2016 versus 2015 you think. What was the increase in regulatory costs in 2015 so far versus 2014? Thanks. Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Brian. It's Mike. First of all, related to the net interest margin, the low 120s basis points, Brian, that I was mentioning in answer to the earlier question is approximately where we are right now. So we reported an overall NIM of 95 basis points. If we strip out the excess deposits and some other near-term items on the balance sheets like higher CD levels and look at, instead, the net interest margin on what we believe to be the long-term balance sheet, which includes the operational deposits and, again, more normal levels, we basically calculate a NIM today in the low 120s basis points. And as I was answering earlier, I think, to Ken's question, that could grind down further by, say, another 25 basis points or so. Or it could increase further or another 30 basis points, 35 basis points or so, depending upon where market interest rates go over the next few years. So your second question was around the excess deposits. On our historical method for calculating excess deposits, which we've given you now for the last couple of years. We estimate that our average excess deposits dropped for average Q3 versus Q2 by approximately $16 billion. So a drop from $62 billion on average at Q2 to $46 billion on average for Q3. But much like what Jim Mitchell was asking about, we would expect if the deposit level simply stay where they are today, that would drop further in Q4 because we will pick up in Q4 the full average. Now I cannot emphasize enough, Brian, that that does assume that there is no significant change in the external environment, and we are very sensitive to the fact, for example, that the last time there was a debt crisis we saw a huge inflow of deposits. So there is certainly other factors out in the environment that could change that. But basically, if nothing else changed in the quarter relative to where things are today, we would see another similar type of drop in the excess deposits in Q4. And then your last question around the regulatory expenses. We declined giving a specific number, Brian, because I just think there is so much art rather than science that goes into estimating all in regulatory expenses. Obviously we track very closely very specific regulatory initiatives like CCAR compliance, but we know that there's upward pressure throughout the organization in terms of first line of defense, second line of defense, corporate audit et cetera, that are \u2013 at least largely a function of the higher regulatory expectations worldwide. So I'd prefer not to give a specific number there. Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Good. That's great color. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So another one on the expense program I guess. May be taken another way, but I guess the challenge that a lot of investors have with a lot of these cost initiatives is that when you look at a point-to-point from the time you guys have announced the original program, call it 2010 through the end of last year at least, you know, expenses are up 20%. Granted, the revenues grew as well, but I think it will help us understand what is the embedded core expense growth in your view that is reasonable for you to have in today's current regulatory environment in order to achieve your organic growth goals. Is it 3%, is it 5%, just to kind of get us somewhere, you know, help us better assess how much of an ultimate bottom-line impact we could have from this program? Thanks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Let me start that, Alex. This is Jay. Reflecting on your math from where we ended up the last program, I think the winds we've been sailing into have largely been regulatory expenditures and the grinding down of interest rates, which have affected net interest revenue I think. I don't have the math in front of me. And I think if you took those away, then you know \u2013 so we would \u2013 you know you can take your own view on where we are on the rate cycle. As Mike indicated, we think we are at least bending the curve on the regulatory cost growth going forward. And if you isolated those two things, it's the operating leverage thing again, and the service business, you are always doing new things for customers, some of that requires expense to do that. But I would point to operating leverage and/or, if you are able to hold those other variables constant, margin improvement. But, Mike, what would you...? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I would add, Alex, that first of all Jay is right. If you adjust for the higher regulatory expenses and the lower net interest revenue from the grind in interest rates we have in fact expanded margins along the lines of, actually a little more than the $625 million that we reported as IT and ops transformation. So the only piece I would add to Jay's answer is that I think importantly, Alex, is the relationship between the fee revenue and the expenses. So, and we've talked about this before. In an environment where fees are growing at 5% say, and again, there's some help from markets in there, there's some help from flows in there, there's some help from market-driven revenues like FX trading revenues. Then we do in fact expect to have that outpace our expenses in a normal period of time. Obviously, that is measured over a longer period of time than just one quarter in any given quarter. For example, Q3 was a good example of that where there is a sharp contraction in markets, particularly like we saw in emerging market equity levels then that relationship won't always hold. But again given the success also we had with the first IT and ops transformation program, I would hope that we built credibility with you in terms of our ability to translate these kinds of programs into our overall margins all things equal. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. So just to paraphrase, more normal environment the operating leverage on the core business ex-rates. We should still think about in that 200 basis point spread and then layer on the savings on top of that? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I wouldn't quite jump to the 200 basis points because again, I think that was a 2015 objective. Which did include by the way some productivity benefits, which have helped us offset some of the upward pressure on regulatory expenses. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. Okay. And then, Jay, just a question for you on the excess deposits again. You alluded to some levers outside of just price increases. Any way to specify, I guess, what those were and the magnitude of the benefit that you guys got from those additional levers when it comes to the $30 billion, $35 billion number? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Alex, I would say that, I mean, if you would call them levers it's probably three things. Its full transparency with customers with specificity around our objective, which translating into from a customer standpoint, they don't always know what excess is. So by putting some point targets that we're trying to solve for is point one. Point two is, second set of levers is what buckets do they have or we have to shed some of these deposits. So some of those are our buckets whether it's money funds, some of those are their buckets whether moving into treasuries or other vehicles. And then the third part of the package is making sure that there's a fee incentive, which reinforces the right behavior that was not dropped on someone, but was introduced in a very measured way over time. So that the customer has the ability to help us manage our collective issue and I say that's the story. And I think going out at the way we went at it, I think was the right way to go at it. And it's more likely to create a more sustained outcome. Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate the detail on emerging markets exposure and the asset servicing business. Another area of the market that had challenges has been energy and commodities. So I just want to get your thoughts, maybe not specific figures around areas of the business where there's asset servicing or asset management that might be exposed to energy and commodities. And whether that's had an impact so far? Thanks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I guess the only thing that I can think of, Adam, maybe by the nature of my hesitation here is it's not much. But I think about commodities and in particular, oil and some sovereign well funds that have downward pressure based on a $45 to $50 a barrel oil pricing and the need to continually fund ongoing operations. That's probably the place that it binds mostly. And I would say it's a discrete set of customers and important, but I'd say in the overall scheme of things, our exposure to commodity prices directly is not that material. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you, Jay. These days not much a pretty good answer there. Turning to asset management and the growth of that business, you've introduced a lot of new ETF products. Just wanted to get a sense of which market segments and channels you're targeting to gain share. And maybe an update on the overall strategic plan with Ron O'Hanley at SSGA? Thanks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Let me start with ETFs and then I'll broaden it out. Our ETF strategy is, you know, we've come from a place where most of our \u2013 originally our business was more institutionally oriented and we're moving to a more retail oriented business, which requires that you hire wholesalers in those country and intermediaries in Europe in order to distribute that product. And we've made pretty big investments over the last 18 months to 24 months to increase our distribution salesforce in the U.S. And we're doing something similar in Europe. So the strategy is multifold. One, it's to \u2013 in addition to the institutional world orient towards the retail world, and with that, bulk up our distribution. And that distribution would be to financial planners, advisors, broker-dealers, private banks. And then the other leg of the strategy is really around on the product side. So you noted in the beginning of your comment that we've introduced quite a few products. The orientation of the new products that we're bringing to market have the characteristic of less pure beta, more involved strategies and therefore higher fees. So the one that I spiked out in my comments was the product we did with DoubleLine. We have several other products, one with Blackstone, bank loan fund. So we're orienting towards maybe more sophisticated and higher-yielding products. And the last point I would make is we have been open and continue to be open to package somebody else's investment expertise in our ETF structuring here and distributed through the distribution force that I just mentioned. I guess if I broaden the question out, the other main emphasis of the SSGA's strategy that I would put a bright light on is the whole solutions world, which for us 401(k) has been a big area of success over the last couple of years. Ron has a big history on that. And even more broadly just Packaging Solutions for not only institutional, but the retail world, And we think with our combination of beta in many flavors, ETF's vehicles, that we're well positioned to succeed in both the ETF and the solutions world. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's great detail. Much appreciated. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Jay, I just wanted to shift the conversation to your third pillar of your long-term plan. How will you be investing for growth during this program? Are you able to size the data and analytics opportunity you noted today? And are there any other revenue opportunities that could emerge from 2016 digitization plan? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I appreciate the question. Broadly, we have been \u2013 even though we don't talk about it a lot on these calls. We haven't lost our way with regard to continuing to invest in things that will be the future growth drivers of the business. The one I like to point to, enhanced custody. Four years or five years ago, a vision that took a couple of years for it to incubate. And now, as you know, it's driving most of the growth in our securities lending business. That's one example. There are several examples around. But if I go to the third pillar of the strategy, the data and analytics business, which we launched I think two years ago now. There are several strategies that we're focused on there. At the core, it's this data aggregation piece. So if we're dealing with an asset manager or an asset owner, the ability to aggregate up data not only our own data but data from other sources through a data warehouse, cleanse it, make sure that it's available real-time, is the foundational stage of that business. And then on the back of that, risk tools. We recently introduced a stress testing tool for fund products where it's really a big data application where we see subscription and redemption history. We know the characteristics of the underlying funds. We can predict or allow a customer to predict how much liquidity is required given the likelihood of redemptions. Interestingly, the SEC and increasingly the other regulators are leaning into the asset management industry to get more sophisticated about liquidity stress testing and fund products. So that converges nicely with that. That's just one example Ashley, but it's clear as day to me that the future is going to be defined by who wins that space, who can digitize their data and who can develop those analytic products that are the value-add to customers in addition to all the custody and operational activities that we conduct. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks for the color there. And then, Mike, as you intensify efforts to reduce these deposits, apart from NII, should we be thinking about any other revenue impact as clients adjust? And then also, how are you addressing the $20 billion or so nonoperational hedge fund deposits? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Ashley. First, on the revenue side, at this point, and I acknowledge that things can change in the future, at this point, I don't expect other second order impact from the deposit actions other than the lost NIR on the excess deposits themselves. So at this point, again, we're not expecting, for example, to lose client relationships over this. Although, again, it's something we're very sensitive to and that's why we've taken the measured approach that we have. And as it relates to the hedge fund and private equity deposits, as we've talked about before, while historically, a chunk of those have \u2013 we've considered to be operational deposits because they are in fact a part of the normal operations and part of the custody relationship. And we do believe to be sticky, they don't count under the LCR rules as being operational deposits. So a portion of those we've seen decline, so a portion of the excess deposits for those clients are included in the deposit reduction that I've mentioned. But as you would expect, a portion have remained sticky, and we do expect that they will remain sticky going forward. And we'll continue to look at the all-in economics of those relationships, but expect them to be sticky. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I guess final question : does this in any way change your view of alternative asset servicing and attractiveness of that business? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, it does not. But we view that as a very attractive segment. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Jay and Mike, I just want to follow up on Alex's question, so the whole thought process of can we see this benefit come to the bottom line. You talked about the fact that \u2013 Alex mentioned the revenue is up as much as expense is up, and you talked about the fact that you were hurt by NIM, but rates are coming down, which is fair. But on the other hand, Jay, you also have a huge benefit from equity markets. I mean, if you look from 2010 onwards, your S&P 500 went from 1,250 to, even just go to the end of second quarter, over 2,000. Your NASDAQ almost doubled from 2,500-plus. So if we don't have that kind of huge market tailwind, should we still like \u2013 should we be able to expect to see this? And on the expense side, while you \u2013 obviously, regulatory expenses were a surprise. There is businesses \u2013 investment costs that have to go in too. So could you add some more color to that? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Vivek, it's Mike. First of all, you're asking the kinds of levels of detail that we intend to cover as part of our Investor Day presentation, and I suspect we'll give some overview on the Q4 call. So I just think it's better laying out the entire plan to then talk about some of the specifics around things like equity market help or the market interest rate environment. I think that's better handled over the course of a multi-hour Investor Day than on this call. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And Jay, how much of this digitization \u2013 since you're doing \u2013 this is coming over five years. How much of this is more what I would think of as business as usual because the world is changing, we're going to more passive assets, more ETFs from active, and so this is just needed given that you've got obviously, lower fees coming on the other side, as opposed to just given that it's such a long timeframe? How much of that is more that \u2013 whatever's coming anyway that you had to... Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I \u2013 in some respects, Vivek, it doesn't matter the asset type, the asset class, the geography. To me, it's really reflective of this pretty cumbersome western world financial landscape that we've created. What we're talking about enhances the value of a passive fund, an alternative fund, a private equity fund. If we can move things through here without human touch it benefits everybody. To the point of \u2013 this is where the world is going. Not just financial services. Everybody's looking to digitize their environment and it's hard to do. And I think that \u2013 I think we have a huge benefit and that we're a large global company, but we've laid the foundation long ago, common systems, common processes to get there first and this, today's announcement is really a reflection of needing to pull it in so that we can get there first because of the, somewhat, the environment which puts pressure on cost. So I think it has the intended benefit of cost saves at the same time, it accelerates our product strategy and should make us more valuable counterparty to our customers. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hi. It's Geoff Elliott from Autonomous Research. Thank you for taking the question. The singular event that you talked about driving up processing expenses, what was that? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'd rather not go into a huge amount of detail, but it's fair to say that we did have a processing error related to a significant once in many, many years, maybe a decades kind of class action situation. And so as a result, of course, we reimbursed the funds that were impacted so that it was our loss, not theirs. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And, Geoffrey, I'd just say that the losses or gains get extreme scrutiny around here, not just to \u2013 there are two things to figure out what happened but also to make sure that it can happen again. And so we take great pride in our record of low operating losses. So when an event like this happens, we turned the place upside down to make sure that everybody understands what happened and why it won't happen again. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : And then on the $500 million, I know you're still kind of working through the fine detail, but can you just explain how you get to that number? Is it a bottom-up exercise? Is it a top-down exercise? Just to kind of get some comfort around the ability to deliver on that without giving us all of the information you're going to work through at the Investor Day. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Geoffrey, this is Jay and Mike can add to this. It is very much a bottoms-up exercise. We have hundreds of people and hundreds of work streams that are looking at \u2013 I'll take the simple one, when an electronic trade comes in, that end-to-end process how many breaks are there in it, what technology needs to be applied, what process needs to change in order to affect what outcome. We have measured the breaks, the outcomes, the cost saves, the people, the systems, so it's in a lot of detail. And very much bottoms-up. You can't just dictate top-down a number and expect that people are going to figure it out. So we've spent the better part of a year in doing the analysis that leads to today's announcement. Mike, you want to add anything? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Geoff, what I would add is that remember this does build off the backbone of the IT and ops transformation program. So one of the infrastructures that was created as part of that is as we move to, for example centers of excellence and as we did the detailed process improvement at work from that program. As Jay indicated, we got very specific, very granular on our unit cost for providing different services along the chain. And as Jay indicated, the $500 million stems from a review of those different links in the chain, if you will, and how much we expect to save through critically applying additional technology to those various links. Again, the piece that is specifically we're going to focus on over the next three months will be the pacing and sequencing. So again, I know several of you are interested in, well what does that mean for 2016? And that is work that we need to do some additional vetting around. And then there will also be some additional investment cost, restructuring programs et cetera that we've got some additional detail to build up as well. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Great. Thank you very much. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : That does conclude the Q&A session for today's conference. I will turn the call back over to Jay for any further statements or closing remarks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks, Stephanie. I'd want to thank, everybody, for their questions and attention today, and we look forward to speaking with you after the fourth quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you.

This new team is the way ahead transforming State Street to extend our leadership position. Please contact with Liz Bremer at IR at statestreet.com for more information or to register. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. Our performance in the fourth quarter reflects the continued challenges presented throughout 2015 including the challenging global equity markets particularly in emerging markets, persistent low interest rates, strengthening U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expectations. We were successful at managing expenses in the quarter in light of the pressure on revenues. In addition, we grew fee revenue in 2015 and achieved strong new business results as evidenced by new asset servicing commitments of $300 billion this quarter and approximately $800 billion for the full year. The challenging conditions notwithstanding, overall I'm disappointed with our full year 2015 performance and how we performed against the various goals we set. We generated 2% operating basis fee revenue growth compared to 2014, which was short of our goal of 4% to 7%. On a constant currency basis our operating base fee revenue was 5.3%. We also fell short of our objective of generating at least 200 basis points of positive fee operating leverage compared to 2014 as we posted a 79 basis point difference in growth. In addition to the challenging revenue environment we experienced regulatory compliance costs and operating losses at a higher level than expected. Actual net interest revenue was in line with our outlook, which reflected the continued low interest rate environment and our balance sheet optimization actions. Our efforts to optimize our balance have resulted in lower excess deposits and stronger capital ratios compared to the levels at the end of 2014, position us well for our long-term capital plan. Lastly, returning capital to our shareholders remains a top priority. We increased our quarterly common share dividend to $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2015, an annualized increase of 14% from 2014 and bought back $1.52 billion in common shares in 2015. As you may have already noted the fourth quarter's results also include a number of items and legal settlements, which we have worked hard to address and put behind us so that we can turn our complete focus on growing our business and improving our operations. Mike Bell will discuss how these items impacted our financial statements. Now I would like to discuss our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We added $300 billion of new servicing commitments during the quarter across all sectors and geographies. The difficult global market environment in 2015 put significant pressure on our clients, creating a positive environment for cross-selling and clients consolidating their service business with fewer providers. Our asset management business experienced net outflows of $19 billion during the fourth quarter of 2015, driven primarily by new outflows of $19 billion from institutional passive mandates and $10 billion in net outflows from cash mandates primarily from securities lending cash collaterals, partially offset by $11 billion of inflows through ETFs. Institutional net outflows were primarily driven by client asset allocation shifts and an expected redemption of one large sub-advisory client that is in-sourcing the business. Redemptions by this client are expected to continue through the remainder of 2016 and assets under management associated with this client was approximately $35 billion at the end of 2015. The low headline net outflows were negative, annualized revenue impact on flows was positive $10 million due to a favorable underlying business mix. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we had approximately $11 billion of positive net flows into our ETFs, including approximately $4.5 billion of inflows for SPY our S&P 500 ETF. We continue to invest in our ETFs with a further 13 new launches in the fourth quarter bringing total 2015 launches to 35. Significant fourth quarter launches included three smart beta ETFs and a natural resources ETF, that immediately ranked in the top 10 launches in the U.S. in 2015. In addition, the SPDR DoubleLine Total Return Tactical ETF was the top product launched in the U.S. in 2015 with $1.8 billion inflows. Overall, our SPDR ETF business had five of the top 10 new product launched in the U.S. with combined assets gathered across all new launches of $4.3 billion. Going into 2016, we continue to focus on what we can control and to do our best to address those elements we cannot control. As we know, the start of year in global markets has not been good, but regardless of the implications to revenues it is our objective to strive to generate positive fee operating leverage. We started the year with new assets to be serviced that remain to be installed in future periods of $378 billion at December 31st, and we continue to see deep and diverse pipelines, which should help our fee revenues. Our overall strategy is well positioned against global markets, which we believe over the long-term will deliver accelerated growth opportunities. Knowing we are off to a difficult start in 2016 we're focused on identifying leverage to improve our performance in 2016 and help us outperform in the current macro-environment. This includes a focus on managing expenses that is in addition to our multiyear transformation program and targeted staff reductions that we discussed on the Q3 '15 earnings call, which is called State Street Beacon. We currently expect State Street Beacon to generate approximately $550 million in the annualized pretax net run rate expense savings by the end of 2020 with approximately $75 million of that run rate savings being achieved in 2016. State Street Beacon leverages the foundation built by our business operations and technology transformation program that was completed in 2014. The program will leverage your cloud infrastructure to drive next generation platforms in order to improve scale and flexibility. Digitization of services and solutions will enable automated access across and improve interfaces with our clients. We expect the end result of the program to produce a lower cost client centric integrated operating model delivering timely information to our global exchange platforms. Not only will we continue our firm-wide focus on expenses, but we are also looking for more ways to accelerate revenue growth through cross-selling and product innovation. I am encouraged by some of the developments we've already seen through our digitization work particularly the data solutions we can offer our customers. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike, who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and then we will be available to take your call -- take your questions. Mike? Mike Bell : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our operating basis results, I'll comment on two significant items that affected our 4Q '15 GAAP basis results as highlighted on Slide 5. First, we recorded a 4Q '15 charge of approximately $17 million and a liability of approximately $240 million related to the matter in which we invoiced certain expenses to asset servicing clients primarily in the U.S. during an 18 year period. The current period charge reflects an accrual for interest that we intend to pay to the impacted clients. $223 million of the liability or $145 million after tax relates to periods prior to the 2015 fiscal year and appears in the beginning routine earnings balance of our statement of shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2014. Please note all prior period financial information within this Slide deck and within our earnings release and addendum have been revised to reflect the impact of the reimbursement on each prior period presented. In addition, we recorded an $82 million pretax gain or $49 million after tax related to the final payoff of a commercial real estate loan acquired as a result of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Now please turn to Slide 9 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 4Q '15 and for full year of 2015. Both 4Q '15 and 2015 full year results reflect the headwinds from challenging global equity market conditions, low interest rates, a stronger U.S. dollar and heightened regulatory expenses. Full year 2015 EPS decreased 3% from 2014 reflecting lower NIR and higher expenses particularly due to the heightened regulatory expectations, partially offset by fee growth and the continued execution of our common stock purchase program. Our pretax operating margin of 29.1% and ROE of 10.7% decreased relative to 2014. Compared to full year 2014, full year 2015 fee revenue was negatively impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar largely offset by a similar benefit in total expenses. On a constant currency basis fees grew by 5.3% versus full year 2014. Turning to 4Q '15 EPS of $1.21 decreased from $1.36 in the year ago quarter and increased from $1.15 in 3Q '15. Our capital ratios improved sequentially and from year-end 2014 reflecting management actions to reduce risk weighted assets and to also reduce the level of excess deposits on our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve discussed we are particularly pleased with our progress on this priority over the second half of 2015. Additionally, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 per share and purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock. Turning to Slide 12, I'll discuss additional details of our operating basis revenue from 4Q '15. Servicing fees decreased primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower international equity markets partially offset by net new business. The decrease in international equity markets particularly in emerging markets continues to negatively impact servicing fees. Compared to the year ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley Emerging Market Index decreased 16%, while the EFA equity index was down approximately 4%. We estimate that approximately 10% of our servicing fees are tied to emerging markets. 4Q '15 management fees decreased relative to a year ago primarily due to the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, net outflows, and lower international equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased due to the lower volatility in volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '14 primarily due to new business and enhanced custody and was higher than 3Q '15 primarily reflecting higher spreads. The increase in processing fees and other revenue from 4Q '14 and 3Q '15 reflects higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments. It's also important to note that this line item, which has a number of elements within it, did experience volatility from quarter-to-quarter was higher in 4Q '15 than normal. In addition, the 4Q '15 revenue also benefited from tax advantage investment seasonality, so we expect to find that to be a little bit lower in 1Q '16. Moving to Slide 13, you can see that our operating basis net interest revenue continued to be pressured by the prolonged low interest rate environment. The decrease in 4Q '15 average earning assets and corresponding increase in the net interest margin reflects the efforts to reduce client deposits that largely occurred towards the end of the third quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 14 to review 4Q '15 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses decreased 3% compared to both 3Q '15 and the year ago quarter, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation and other expenses. Other expenses included a $12 million settlement with the SEC related to the previously disclosed allegations of improper conduct in the solicitation of asset servicing business. Now turning to Slide 16 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital ratios remained strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Importantly at December 31st our common equity Tier 1 ratio under both the Basel III fully phased-in advanced and standardized approach increased from September 30th principally due to lower risk-weighted assets. The December 31st fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio at the bank also increased to 5.7% on a fully phased-in basis principally due to the full quarter effect of our proactive efforts to reduce client deposits in September. Moving to Slide 17, let me review the financial details of the State Street Beacon program. We expect to achieve annual pretax net run rate expense savings of approximately $550 million by the end of 2020. In 2016, we expect to achieve $75 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings, which includes the savings associated with the reduction in force that we announced in 3Q '15. In 2017, we expect to achieve an additional pretax net run rate expense savings of at least a $125 million. Included in the targeted $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings are ongoing investments to support the program. Importantly, we expect State Street Beacon to improve our operating basis pretax profit margin to at least 31% by 2018 and to 33% by the end of 2020 all else equal. To accomplish our savings targets, we expect to incur restructuring charges of approximately $300 million to $400 million from 2016 through 2020 and we look forward to providing a further update at our Investor Day on February 24th. Now let's move onto Slide 18 and 19 for a review for our 2016 financial outlook. During 2016, we remain focused on our key priorities of returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and investing in the business to provide solutions to our clients. Although we anticipate that the environment will continue to be challenging in 2016, managing expenses is a high priority. It is our objective to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Now please be aware that the year-to-date weakness in the equity markets will adversely affect total revenue. As a reminder a 10% decline in global equity markets is expected to result in approximately 2% of downward pressure on our total revenue. While upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue in 2016, we expect the growth rate of regulatory and compliance expenses to be lower than 2015. We also expect expense growth to be affected by new business as well as continued investments. Also it's important to highlight that as in prior years the first quarter 2016 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher due to the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation for retirement eligible employees as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. We expect the incremental amount attributed to equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2016 to be in a range of approximately $130 million to $140 million. As you can see, we developed two scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at current levels. Under this scenario, we expect full-year 2016 NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increase 25 basis points in both March and June and in the U.K. rates increase 25 basis points in both May and August. Under this scenario, we expect full-year 2016 NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Additionally, we expect the (2006) (sic) (2016) operating basis tax rate to be in a range of 30% to 32%. Turning to the last slide, I would emphasize that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a high priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process including a review by the Federal Reserve Board. Now before I turn the call over to Jay, I would like to inform all of you that David Gutschenritter, the Company Treasurer has informed me of his intention to retire after 11 years with State Street. Dave has been an incredible positive force in his role as Treasurer. As the industry evolved and the regulatory environment became more complex, Dave brought the talent, processes and leadership needed to assure our continued success. We will miss him tremendously. Dave has agreed to stay on in an advisory capacity through July 30th to ensure orderly transition of his responsibilities. And as part of our succession plan, the Board of Directors has elected Tracy Atkinson to Treasurer affective February 1st. In addition to a number of other leadership roles in finance, Tracy has had oversight for Global Treasury for the past five years, so we expect her transition to the Treasurer role to be smooth. Dave has had close relationships with many of you over the last several years and for those of you attending our Investor Day next month, they will have the opportunity to wish him well. Now, I'm going to turn the call back over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Mike. Crystal, we are all set to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe Mike and Jay if you can talk a little bit about the market assumptions that you have underlying the assumption of generating stronger fee growth in 2016 versus the operating expenses? And then maybe if you could just give a little bit more color on what you\u2019re thinking about for operating expenses on an absolute basis in '16 versus '15? Thanks. Jay Hooley : I am sorry Brian, can you just repeat the end of that second part of your question? Brian Bedell : So on the expense side, if you can give us a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about the absolute level of expenses of operating expenses in 2016 versus '15? Mike Bell : Okay. So, that\u2019s helpful Brian. I\u2019ll handle both of those. First, in terms of your question on the market assumptions, candidly Brian, given all the uncertainty in the market environment, I am really reluctant to give you at this point a concrete forecast and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t include that in the prepared remarks and in the slide presentation. I am sure it's not lost on you that the equity markets thus far in January for example are down high single digits and the emerging markets even worse. And particularly with our mix of business that would be a serious headwind. So instead we\u2019re really focused on achieving overall fee operating leverage in 2016 and we recognize that that would be more challenging if in fact equity markets remain uncooperative for the rest of the year. But we\u2019re focused on as Jay said what we can control. We feel good about the Beacon savings that we\u2019ll get in 2016. We recognize that there is some upward pressure on the regulatory expenses but we think that will be at a lower rate than what it's been in the last -- in 2015. And so we\u2019re really looking at managing really every expense dollar. And that really relates to your second question, which is, in terms of our overall expense growth plan, it will be largely dependant upon fee revenue. We intend to manage expenses at a lower rate than what our fees grow. And again it will be more challenging if the environment is difficult but that\u2019s our plan and that\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at every area of expenses, we\u2019re looking at management layers, we\u2019re looking at procurement, we\u2019re looking at outside consultants, we\u2019re looking at real estate, we\u2019re looking at low return businesses. I mean really we\u2019re looking at the entire spectrum with a goal of getting to that positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016. Brian Bedell : And maybe just talk about the Beacon program a little bit more. Maybe just start with the trajectory at the $75 million and the actual -- the addition of the incremental $125 million in 2017. So from a timing perspective during the year, how should we be thinking of that that layering in the quarters? Jay Hooley : Let me start and I\u2019ll let Mike answer the financial question. But let me just -- I think this will help you understand the pacing. If we go back to five, six years ago, we began with the IT and ops transformation emphasis on transformation. It was really to take our common systems, standardized processes, establish centers of excellence and we also introduced a public cloud and began to rewrite some of those core systems underlying those applications. Beacon takes it to the next step and I can\u2019t emphasize enough that you can\u2019t take the second step unless you have successfully taken the first step. The second step is to -- I\u2019d say wired together all of these different systems which in most financial institutions are not wired together on a real time basis. So, in the future state of Beacon I\u2019ll use a simple example. In our fund accounting area, we would expect that an electronic trade invoice coming in from a customer would electronically in real time basis hit the security system, the cash system, the accounting system and update the pricing on a real time basis. So if you let your mind wander in a future state that means our whole environment becomes real time and you could dynamically price funds during the day. That will have the attendant benefits of obviously cost efficiency as you replace human intervention and disparate systems with fully integrated systems. It will also reduce errors and risk but probably most importantly and I keep covering this ground because I am not sure everybody fully appreciates the value of real time information upstream for our customers form office for purposes of risk management, investment management, et cetera. So, that\u2019s the journey. Now let me come back to a little bit more narrowly on your question. This next stage of transformation heavily involves technology development and integration. And so there is a little bit of [comp] timing that we were doing in 2015, which will continue in 2016 in building the systems and the integration models, which means that the trajectory of cost saves will start out slowly and build over time. So out of the $550 million you can take the $75 million in '16, the $125 million in '17 that will just continue to build. I will say that the trajectory into a year would probably have a similar path. But Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to add any color to that? Mike Bell : Sure, Brian, the additional color that I would give you is it's important to note that the $75 million is intended to be a net number in terms of our operating expense impact in full year 2016 compared to operating expenses in full year 2015. So the bottom line is gross savings will be higher than $75 million, but there will be some net spending which in particular is very helpful to position us to get some additional savings in 2017 and 2018, which is even higher than what we'll deliver in 2016. So the spending I would expect to hit to impact Q1, and I agree with Jay, the savings in 2016 will mainly begin in Q2 and ramp throughout the year. So I expect a little bit of a bubble in Q1 and then net savings beginning in Q2 and accelerating through the remainder of the year. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : I just wanted to clarify one thing on that expense comment, the $75 million in 2016, I think is not on top of the $50 million that you've mentioned at the time of the headcount reduction, correct? And that you said your intention is to be a net number '16 versus '15 full year? Jay Hooley : Yes, both of those comments are correct, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Okay, awesome. Curious I am talking about the investment portfolio, it was what you called ongoing repositioning of the investment portfolio. If you look at your appendix slide, it's now 64% fixed grade, so I am curious on what's driving that change and is it the duration extension on the government side and does that mean that -- what does that mean for your rate sensitivity? Mike Bell : Sure, Glenn. So first of all in terms of the repositioning of the investment portfolio, you are correct that we have skinnied down in particular the floating rate assets that are -- had been denominated in U.S. dollars. And the reason for that is the same thing that we've talked about on earlier calls in 2015 and that is, those are primarily asset backed securities and they are relatively low spread assets compared to for example U.S. treasuries. They also don't get counted as favorably as U.S. treasuries do and they're treated relatively harshly in CCAR because if you recall at the last financial crises, spreads blew out for those assets and therefore the mark-to-market under the CCAR stress test is particularly unfavorable. So the U.S. dollar based floating rate securities in particular are -- I would characterize it is as the least attractive of the portfolio assets that we're on the books say a year ago. So that's been the major driver of wanting to move away from those assets. And in terms of your question on the rate sensitivity, again we look at the interest rates sensitivity through several different lenses and I feel very comfortable there has been no change in our philosophy. We continue to invest through the cycle. Again, we're working to optimize against a number of different regulatory expectations and constraints, but I would characterize it as no material change in our thinking around interest rate sensitivity. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Just one little follow-up on that, when you look at your margin targets, I think they included 100 basis points of hikes through the end of '17, so I am just going to guess and say 50-50 in '16 and '17. Is the math on the impact of the margin, if rates don't change, the same as the math that you gave us on a static and higher rates scenario? I mean, we talk about the same numbers I could just back into that and see that the impact on margin targets if rates don\u2019t change? Mike Bell : Yes, Glenn, I think that's fair. We are going to provide an update at the February Investor Day around the longer term NIM ranges including static, including ideally getting to something like a 3/5 long-term interest rate structure. I think the main pivotal point Glenn though is that I want to make this morning is that we do expect that the Beacon savings will fall to our bottom lines. We expect that the Beacon savings will be additive to profit margins. So when we say all else equal, we know that there will be other things going on in the world that are impacting margins. I think that you've mentioned NIR. NIR obviously can be separately highlighted and analyzed. But the bottom line, most pivotal comments that we're making is, we do expect the Beacon savings to be additive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Mike, you had good improvement on the Tier 1 leverage ratio which is your limiting ratio as we get into CCAR '16. And obviously with the challenges on the environment translating to challenges for your earnings run rate. I am just wondering, plus the restructuring charges still are coming in and affecting net income. Can you remind us again when you think about CCAR going forward how do you think about your payout ratio? Do you think about it on a net income number or do you think about it on an operating number? And how do these change in the environment if at all change your desire to get through the rest of the buyback to the extent you had recently got an approval and change your thinking at all for going forward? Mike Bell : Sure Ken, I appreciate the question. First, let me just comment on your first piece, because I think it was a very important point and that is, as you can imagine for CCAR, reducing our excess deposits by approximately $36 billion over the second half of 2015 is particularly helpful for us going into CCAR. And obviously we don\u2019t have the CCAR instructions yet, the specifics around the stress test. But any way you slice it, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we made and we feel good about the position we\u2019ll be in for the next CCAR, particularly relative to what we would have been in if we hadn\u2019t reduced the deposits. On your specific question around the income, both income majors are very relevant. The net income major is relevant and also the operating income is relevant. First the operating income really represents Ken our best estimate of what our run rate earnings are. So, if you think about what the next three or four years are going to be, the operating income is what we think of as the starting point ideally to grow then over the next several years. So I think that\u2019s a very important data point for the upcoming CCAR. Having said that, net income obviously impacts capital, and so left to only that one issue, the restructuring charges or the FX settlement charges that we took in the first and second quarter of 2015 or even this out of pocket issue, all of that decreased capital essentially dollar for dollar, which is why it's very important for us to be managing capital as aggressively as we can. Because at the end of the day what we believe to be our binding constraint is actually our overall capital ratios and in particular the next CCAR test will show what does that capital position look like under the stress test. So that\u2019s maybe a longer winded answer than you may have been looking for, but the bottom line is both of those income numbers matter, because the operating income will be more predictive or we expect to be more predictive of what our future income will be. But the net income impacts the capital position that we\u2019re sitting here with today dollar for dollar. Ken Usdin : Thanks Mike. And if I can just then follow up just on the balance sheet, you said $36 billion reduction second half. So can you just -- what was the excess deposits at the end of the year and would you continue to expect additional roll down of those going forward or have you worked it to the point where it's now more manageable? And perhaps you won\u2019t need -- I guess the question is do you have any incremental need left after all this reduction for any preferreds? Mike Bell : So, Ken first to answer your factual question, we estimate that under our historical methodology our excess deposits averaged approximately $26 billion in Q4. Now as we\u2019ve talked about before, that\u2019s the historical definition under the LCR rules, some of what we\u2019ve thought of as operational deposits no longer account so at some point we\u2019re going to flip over to a definition of non-operational deposits that for example would include deposits we have with hedge funds and private equity relationships. And even though those are normal operations with our custody relationships there, for LCR purposes they are accounted as non-operational. But to answer your question factually $26 billion versus our average at Q2 was $62 billion, so a $36 billion reduction there. On your question on the -- are we going to push harder and what about the issue around prefs. First of all, Ken the short answer would be that we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve accomplished. And this has not been a trivial exercise. This is an issue that\u2019s a sensitive one for a number of our clients. And so the fact that we feel good that we got to a win-win with our clients after all these discussions, we think that got us to a real good point. So I would say at this point we don\u2019t feel compelled to drive more off of the balance sheet relative to where they were for example in Q4. But it is something that we\u2019re going to monitor carefully. It is something that\u2019s subject to market conditions. The situation in Europe for example is just not helpful at all. I mean with the ECB cutting to minus 30, talking about possibly cutting further, credit spreads have come in dramatically in Europe because of their quantity of easing. So, for all those reasons, I think we have to continue to monitor this but at this point I feel good about where we are. Now your question on prefs is one of those I can\u2019t yet answer fully, because we don\u2019t have the CCAR stress test. I mean obviously we\u2019re in a much better position but until we see the dynamics around that stress test and go through that modeling over the next 60 days. I am just not in a position to give you an estimate at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein. Luke Montgomery : I just wanted to take another quick stab at Brian's question on the 2016 outlook, maybe you've answered it but it wasn't clear to me. When you establish the positive fee operating leverage goal, did you factor in the decline you had in the markets year-to-date or are you assuming year end market levels? Mike Bell : Luke, it's Mike. We certainly factored in what we know about markets as of today, and I think deep down we feel like there's more opportunity for improvement over the course of the year, but I think the most important thing is that we are focused Luke on controlling expenses. The item that we can -- that's within -- best within our control. And we do expect, again barring a catastrophe in terms of further deterioration in markets to be able to get to that net all-in positive fee operating leverage for the full year. Now again it is something that -- because it is subject to market conditions, it's probably something that we want to update you on at the Investor Day in February, at each subsequent quarter our focus and Luke I guarantee the management team is really galvanized around this. Collectively our focus is to generate positive fee operating leverage for the full year. Luke Montgomery : Okay thanks. And then just a follow-up on the balance side. I know it depends on client behavior, but apart from that are you assuming any growth from the current earning assets of $200 billion in your guidance for 2016? Mike Bell : Luke we anticipate a small decline in the average earning assets over the course of the full year but I think the more important point is the point that you've just made, which is, in large part it will be a function of market interest rates and just overall market conditions. But our feeling is that if the Fed funds rate increases by an additional 50 basis points, if Bank of England increases by an additional 50 basis points, that a good chunk of those excess deposits that are remaining will naturally come off the balance sheet and we do expect growth in our core business. So we would expect some growth in the operational deposits from growth in our core business. But I would say net-net I would expect that the average earning assets to be modestly less by year end 2016. Now importantly if there is a crisis again God forbid, all bets are off, I mean we're on a safe haven in terms of crisis so hopefully that's not going to happen, but that would be another wildcard. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, I wanted to understand your guidance a little bit more. So your target had been to grow fee revenues to expenses by 200 basis points, last year it came in at 79 basis point and now your target is simply I guess 1 basis point, right, just 1 positive operating leverage. So on the one hand you were disappointed that you didn't meet the target last year, on the other hand the new target is basically just positive operating leverage. So I just want to reconcile those thoughts of being disappointed but then again lowering the target quite a bit and I think I've heard the reason the lower stock market, lower rates in Europe, currencies and regulatory costs, but rather hear you validate that or you elaborate on it? Mike Bell : Sure, Mike, it's Mike. I'll start and if Jay wants to add. I mean importantly Mike we want to get every dollar of positive fee operating leverage that we can in 2016 and we're committed as we talked about to aggressively managing expenses to work towards achieving that goal. But it's the point that you've made. I mean with equity markets off almost 10% and we're not even through January yet, it just seemed to us to be irresponsible to put a specific number out there even in light of how confident we feel in Beacon. So again as I said to a couple of the earlier questions, I mean sure this is something that we'll talk about through the course of the year, but it's not a question of lowering our expectations. It's being cognizant of the environment and focusing aggressively on what we can control. Mike Mayo : And as far as the actual expense guidance with project Beacon, last year, your core expenses were $7.520 billion and so for this year should we simply subtract $75 million, since that's the net number or that doesn\u2019t reflect the additional expense pressures? Mike Bell : Well, it doesn't reflect for example expenses that I would expect to bring on to service the new business that we're winning out in the markets. So that's why I wouldn't stay away from just a raw expense number and it's going to largely depend upon our fee revenue growth. Since we're in the service business, we tend to need to bring on servicing capabilities to service new revenue. As I mentioned earlier as well the regulatory related expenses will likely increase, we don't think it will increase as much as they did in 2015. But that's why really Mike we're focused on fee operating leverage, positive fee operating leverage as being the overall goal, recognizing that the equity markets in January really make that a challenging objective. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, the way you look at it, what was your pretax margin for 2015 especially since you\u2019re looking to take that quite a bit higher? Mike Bell : 29.1%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty with Bank of America. Adam Beatty : I wanted to ask about the NIR guidance and in particular you\u2019ve been asked about some assumptions. You\u2019ve noted in your presentation the impact of foreign exchange on NIR. So I was just wondering, what is kind of your base case for the NIR scenarios was in terms of currency flat from here or something different from that? And then maybe how sensitive that number would be to currency? Mike Bell : So in terms of the NIR ranges that we provided, it essentially assumes today\u2019s foreign exchange currency rates. Now again we recognize that that's a wildcard and as an example if we look at full year 2015 versus full year 2014, we estimate that NIR was negatively impacted by $54 million as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar over the course of 2015. So, obviously I don\u2019t expect that the U.S. dollar will strengthen further, at least at that kind of magnitude that we saw in 2015 but that would give you at least a sense of the magnitude if we had a repeat of that level of strengthening, that\u2019s the ballpark that we can see as a additional headwind in NIR. Obviously if the euro turns around and it got stronger in particular that would be helpful. Adam Beatty : So the portfolio hasn\u2019t been repositioned such that the currency effect will be drastically different? Mike Bell : That\u2019s correct. Adam Beatty : And then turning to the new business wins in asset servicing, you mentioned the positive mix shift in asset management despite the negative flows over the positive revenue impact. So I was just wondering about asset servicing and the new wins, how that mix is shaping up? And also in terms of implementation, how soon you would expect the current backlog to be installed? Thanks. Jay Hooley : Sure Adam let me take that. So I mentioned $300 billion-ish of new commitments on the asset servicing side, a little bit unusual, that was [tilted] to the U.S. with $250 billion of the $300 billion being U.S. and then I think you had $35 billion and $15 billion in EMEA and Asia Pacific. So to me it's a little bit indicative of some of the pressure that the asset management industry is under, now that it's not global but it's probably a little bit more acute in the U.S. And so the opportunity to do more deeper level of outsourcing as well as consolidate more activities with State Street is probably the underlying theme there. You also asked about the backlog, which again is a little bit higher at $380 billion and I think that\u2019s probably historically been in the $200 billion to $300 billion range. It\u2019s elevated because there is some bigger chunkier deals that had a little longer implementation time line. Those should layer in the first couple of quarters of 2016. Additionally, I would say from an outlook pipeline standpoint actually quite good with some different color from the U.S. to the Europe to Asia. Asia continues to be moving in a pretty positive line. Europe is again dominated by the offshore markets which is where the asset is coming from. And I\u2019d say the U.S. it's a combination of hedge and as I mentioned earlier the traditional loan-only managers, who are really grappling with fee pressure and flows and [where] an opportunity for them to streamline their operations and get more efficient. Adam Beatty : That\u2019s great color. Am I right in assuming the asset management outsourcing is relatively high fee versus the current mix or not so much? Jay Hooley : Asset management outsourcing broadly would be very consistent with the existing business from a fee and margin standpoint if I heard your question right. Adam Beatty : Yes, I think you did. Thank you, Jay, appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just a quick follow-up first on the Beacon question and the $75 million. Sorry to come back to it. I just want to make sure I understand. You expected it to be in number but you also talked about growing regulatory expenses albeit at a selling rate. So does that $75 million net reflect what your expectations on the regulatory front or is that regulatory headwind albeit at a declining rate a separate issue and if so can you help us frame the regulatory headwind by letting us know how much -- what the growth rate was full year '15 versus '14? Mike Bell : Sure. Brennan this is Mike. First it's the latter. The regulatory expenses -- regulatory related expenses we look at them as a separate category from Beacon, so I do expect that some piece, although certainly not all of it or anything, but some piece of the Beacon savings would be offset by the additional growth in regulatory related expenses that we expect for 2016. And as we have talked about in the past Brennan I am really reluctant to try to give a very specific number on regulatory related expenses. I just think that at this point it's truly embedded in the enterprise. I mean we're all spending more time and attention on regulatory related issues and I just think that I mean it would take this sort of massive time and motion kind of study to give you a number that would accurately portray it. I mean it's fair to say there is significant upward pressure although as I said it's certainly fair to say that we still expect the bulk of the $75 million of the Beacon savings to drop to the bottom line. Again all the things equal the conversations that we had earlier. Adam Beatty : Sure and I get that it's a tough one to try to frame and then we're in unchartered waters, just figured I'd give it a shot. Second question is on the asset management business. So just curious if you could help us think about the ETF flows. You had a good December which certainly helped out on the quarter, but seems like outflows were a little bit of a struggle on the ETF front for the SPDR's platform in 2015. So obviously you guys are working to try to launch new products as an offset there, but can you give us maybe broadly and strategically whether or not you think that's sufficient? Is it all just Vanguard and Price competition and given how the legacy or the previous SPDR's platform was positioned, you're more subject to that type of competition which is why you're going in the new direction? And how should we think about seasonal outflows which is it the other side of just the seasonal inflows in December, any color you could give us on that front just to help us model for this quarter would be great? Thanks a lot. Jay Hooley : Great Brian, I am happy to pick that one up. Let me give you some numbers and then maybe I'll get to some more of your qualitative questions as to where we're on a journey to make ETF more important business for us. If I look at full year 2015, our net outflows were approximately $23 billion, our net outflows of the SPY which is the S&P 500 was outflows of $31 billion. So if you take the influence of the S&P 500 out of the mix, we would net up [$80 billion] and we would net up $11 billion in the fourth quarter. So there is a -- if you look at trends and you normalize for the S&P 500 which is a very large fund with fairly low fees that move a lot because people use it for liquidity purposes all over the globe. Right in that we have -- we've been on a two year journey to invest in our ETF platform in really two directions. One is that, initially our ETF orientation was more to the institutional market. We've ramped up considerably our intermediary sales force over the last couple of years. And the other place that we focused is on product. And our focus on product which really gets at maybe the heart of one of your questions has been away from the more commoditized type product and more towards the higher revenue yielding products. And so you saw some evidence in my quote, in 2015, we had five of the top U.S. new products in the marketplace and in fact we had 37% of the flows into new U.S. ETFs came to SSGA in 2015. So to me very good evidence that our strategy of not only building up our distribution sales force but reorienting our product towards the higher yielding products. I also referenced the smart beta theme which you tend to read about a lot, lately we think that's a big deal which is to take ETFs and bundle them in an asset allocation model and package them and sell them through largely intermediary market. We introduced three new smart beta ETFs to our model portfolios, there's another name given to that in the fourth quarter. And then the final point I would make, next to final point is that, we continue to be the only of the large players that are willing to open our platform to outside strategies. So the most recent would be the DoubleLine Fund which generated -- which is the largest new fund launch in the U.S. in 2015 at $1.8 billion. So I think we're doing all the things, we're executing on all the things that we set out to execute, and I think we're in a good track to make ETF not only a growth engine within SSGA but a bigger product overall State Street. So we are pleased with the progress. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : One quick follow-up on expenses, just so I fully understand what you're saying. If fee revenue is flat or down, can you have expenses down or is there a presumption of fee income growth despite the equity market decline so far? Mike Bell : Jim, it's Mike. First of all obviously given the uncertainty around the environment it's difficult to answer your question definitively with full confidence. But I stand by what we talked about earlier, which is we do expect to manage expenses at a lower rate above growth in the revenue. At this point, I do expect that as long as markets reasonably cooperated we would still end up with full year net fee revenue growth. But again as we talked about earlier, it's something that we\u2019ll probably need to continue to update you on over the course of the year. But our expectation is to manage expenses aggressively and to manage those to a lower growth rate than the fee revenue. Jim Mitchell : And just maybe on your NIR guidance with two rate hikes, the low end is actually lower than the high end of your additional rate hikes. It seems pretty modest impact from two rate hikes despite the 10-Q disclosure. So is that a change in deposit outflow assumptions or is it just timing in terms of the remaining six months of the year versus the full 12 months and beyond? How should we think about your NIR leverage given your 10-Q disclosures which are much more significant? Mike Bell : Sure Jim. First of all, the 10-Q disclosures importantly, number one, assume no client behavior change. And we do anticipate with a couple of more hikes for excess deposits in particular to come off the balance sheet. Second, importantly the 10-Q disclosures are for a consistent interest rate change globally. And I would tell you that that is in my view highly unlikely to be the case in Europe. The ECB now has cut rates to minus 30, there is talk about cutting that further. As I mentioned earlier the credit spread compression that we\u2019ve seen in Europe because of their quantitative easing program has been significant. So I mean just to give you perhaps a number to help with the modeling, we estimate that on an all in basis this year versus full year 2015 that the euro NIR is expected to decline by approximately $40 million year-over-year and that\u2019s assuming the interest rates in Europe where they sit today, just not factor in fully additional deterioration. So, it is the case that we would expect things to be stronger in the U.S. but that\u2019s a headwind. And again relative to full year 2015, the decline in the excess deposits would also be a headwind to NIR; on the other hand, obviously still very positive versus having the issue of the prefs to pay for those. Jim Mitchell : And then last question from me, about securities lending, you saw short term spreads widen quite a bit in the fourth quarter that seems to be continuing so far. Was most that impact already felt in 4Q or should we see some further benefits to wider spreads if they stay where they are in 1Q on the sec lending side? Mike Bell : Jim it's obviously a little bit early to give you definitive guidance on sec lending for the first half of the year. I would say that we feel very positive about the uptick in sec lending. In Q4 specifically we saw an increase in the average assets on loan, both fully enhanced custody business as well as the Agency business. We saw higher spreads particularly on U.S. equities and believe that the demand for short interest and in particular for specials in Q4 helped significantly. I wouldn\u2019t at this point -- I mean I see nothing to believe that that is going to come down. On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t try to project additional growth since Q4 was as strong as it was. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you for taking the question. I\u2019ve got a question on the senior secured bank loan book. Do you know where that would be if you look to sit on a mark to market basis rather than an accrual accounts end basis? Mike Bell : Sure Geoff it's Mike. I don\u2019t have the very specific number off the top of my head, because we have been tight in terms of our credit underwriting and also have been investing in the upper end of the credit scale for those leverage loans, it would be closer to par than the overall market. It\u2019s at a slight discount but I want to say round numbers about $0.98 on the $1. Geoffrey Elliott : And what\u2019s the energy component within that portfolio? Mike Bell : It's relatively small. It's approximately $55 million of the $3.3 billion in the overall portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Jay can you share with us, you mentioned about the new program Beacon as a step two and you needed to take step one of course to get to step two. Is there going to be a step three, is this an involving process? I know this goes up to 2020, which is a ways away, but when you look out longer term is this just an ongoing fact of this business that you've got constantly have these big programs? Jay Hooley : I would say largely, Gerard, I would view this being a two stage event. Stage one complete, stage two just commenced. There will always be opportunities to apply technology to this business both to generate revenue opportunities and expense saves. But in my vision there's Beacon. Since we have gone through the staging of standardization, centers of excellence, rewriting a lot of the applications, I think once we wired them together and for me the Holy Grail is to create an environment within State Street that's all real-time. And if it's all real-time, you have minimal human intervention, you have all the attendant benefits of it and in my mind as we get out to 2020 we should largely be there. Not that there won't be -- I'd say if there was a stage three it would be more revenue oriented. Once we can create a real-time infrastructure, we have the opportunity to build systems and build capabilities to generate global exchange type opportunities is probably where the next big move is. But again it's not cost oriented it's more how you take the data on analytics that are created in this Beacon environment and create information based services to our customers that would be obviously chargeable. Gerard Cassidy : Now is the technology that you're anticipating to get this going, is it all available now or are you anticipating there will be even more advances in technology three years from now that will make deposits even better for the customers? Jay Hooley : That's a great question and I would say we have a plan with a lot of detail around it, but I would fully expect that as we get out in years that technology advances will cause us to make adjustments to the plan. And I'll just give you an example Gerard that hopefully will resonate. When we went into the ITOT as we call it, we were very determined that we wanted to create a cloud environment and we're also very convinced that the only cloud environment that was appropriate would be a private cloud that we would own and operate and control it. I think today it's quite a bit different. We would envision that some of that the test modules that we would build, we might run around a public could. That as long as you encrypt the data you are as safe running it out in the public cloud as you're in a private cloud. And I'd say, if you talk to people that are deeply involved in this world, you would find that to be a fairly meaningful shift in philosophy. So within our Beacon plans some of that is bled-in, but I think for us to imagine what the technology enablements will be five years out is pretty tough to do. I think though it's back to a point that I made and you reinforced which is, unfortunately you can't leap frog. So you have to modify along the way and we think we've got a plan that not only enables us to get to that future real state, but it will also allow us to take advantage of advances in technology as they unfold over the next five years. Gerard Cassidy : Great and then as a second question, coming to you again Jay, you've mentioned that the assets under management this year, a large client was going to take out $35 billion I think you said. Couple of questions, one, why is the client leaving? And two, $35 billion is that a real big customer, medium-sized customer, small customer, how would you characterize that type of client? Jay Hooley : Sure, so I would say it's a customer where we have a long-term multidimensional relationship, this is just one component of it. I would characterize it as a smallest kind of customer and I say that because it's all passive assets. So it' a little bit my SPDR S&P 500 example where the headline number is big but the revenues associated with it are not all that, not significant. The other point I would make Gerard is that, well not a trend, it's not exceptional that somebody would say, I want to run my passive assets myself and this particular customer was a bank decided that as opposed to outsourcing that to us they would in-source it to themselves. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, just a quick question. On the expense billing program, are the costs associated with that billing error I guess it is? You said you had a $223 million pretax liability associated with that. I was just curious as to why that didn't hit the P&L and is that excluded from your operating guidance when it is expected at P&L, I guess sometime this year? Mike Bell : Brian, it's Mike. First this does relate to overbilling that we have had historically, in fact it goes back to the late 1990s. So as a result rather than charging the Q4 2015 P&L with that amount we have revised the other financial statements that we provided this quarter to basically make an adjustment to the most recent P&L periods and also to the retained earnings account for year-end '14. So this is reflected in that retained earnings statement, so it's already negatively impacted our capital, that piece for the liabilities that I talked about in the prepared remarks, that is behind us at this point. Now, obviously, as you can imagine, other things can develop, but at this point, that\u2019s already reflected in the balance sheet and in prior earnings periods. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just on the operating leverage guidance, so if we\u2019re assuming taking your 10% decline in equity markets, there is 2% decline in revenues, just kind of putting that through the year-to-date numbers, I mean a 7% decline in the equity market thus far equates about 1.4% of decline in the revenues. So given that the $75 million reduction in expenses that you\u2019re expecting to hit is just about 1% of your operating expenses, where also that $75 million of expenses come from to get you to positive operating leverage assuming no further change in equity markets to year end? Mike Bell : Importantly Brian we\u2019re looking number one, at expenses across the board. So I do expect that we\u2019ll find additional expense opportunities beyond what is part of project Beacon. Second, you\u2019re assuming that there is no other fee revenue growth over the course of 2016 in your comments. And I would anticipate that between net new business and potential growth in for example global markets revenue that we would still be able to get there. But again it's something that\u2019s an evolving situation since the market environment is as challenging as it is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : I wanted to focus on the net interest income, which if you look at the last year, you were down 13%, if you adjust for currencies down 11%. That\u2019s really the major source of underperformance relative to the other trust banks that were both up around 8%. So, their ability to add duration on their side, or benefit from rather upticks you get in that fund rate is kind of swamping what you\u2019re having to deal with. Catalysts that you see balancing restructuring or maybe more focus in Europe, how do those catalysts begin to wane and when do you get back on track to be in line with the other peers? Mike Bell : So Marty it's Mike. First, I am really reluctant to try to give you specific comparisons to our various benchmark competitors. Our business mix is very different. As you correctly pointed out we\u2019ve tended to have more impact from changes in Europe than our competitors over the long-term. I think that served us well. But in the near-term that\u2019s a pressure point. We have different portfolios. We have different mixes of business that those portfolios back. So again I would hesitate to try to give you a very specific comparison because I don\u2019t know specifically how they\u2019re managing their balance sheet. What I can tell you is how we\u2019re managing our balance sheet and in terms of the catalyst, as we talked about, we do expect that the recent increase in the Fed funds rate to be particularly helpful. That for example, even though it's just for the U.S. dollars, it does mean that the floating rate assets that we have that are dollar denominated have been resetting over the course of the last three months and that\u2019s been helpful in terms of the near-term NIR outlook. If we do get additional Fed fund increases, again we expect that to do a couple of things for us. Number one, we do expect that to be accretive to NIR, because while we will share in all likelihood some of that with clients, we do typically share a percentage for example of the Overnight Index and would retain a portion of that for ourselves. And then just longer term it's helpful to have these increases in interest rates, because Marty, one of the big things that weighed on us in 2015 is the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. About two-thirds of the portfolio is fixed rate and that\u2019s been rolling over, the yield on the maturing assets has been quite a bit higher in ballpark like 75 basis points higher than the fixed rate yield of new purchases. So if interest rates particularly in that call it three year, five year, 10 year kind of zone, would increase consistently where the Fed fund rate may increase that would be helpful in terms of reducing that grind. And then maybe lastly, you mentioned it and I am just repeating it. If conditions got better in Europe either in terms of getting the ECB rate back closer to positive territory and ideally some credit spread widening that would be very helpful as well. Marty Mosby : And just another question, if you look at the emphasis you had on trying to push some of the marginal deposits out of the balance sheet, have you seen any implication to customer relationships because of that? Fee income seems to be doing relatively well, market share holding in there. But just was interested that efforts you're doing to try to overcome your emphasis on that side. Jay Hooley : Yes, Marty, let me take that, this is Jay. I would say broadly no. I think that -- what I think we did well is we got way out in front of this. So that was really the beginning of 2015 where we began to have a series of conversations with our customers and there was a shorter percentage of customers who are holding the lion's share of the excess deposits which made it helpful. But we worked with customers over the course of six months to make sure, one, they understood the issue and our pressure point, and two, begin the layer in a set of fees to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. And so we gave customers enough lead time in order to manage the situation or pay the freight to hold excess deposits on our balance sheet. So I think the nature of the way we went about it and also I think the other thing that's probably safe to say is that, we are probably out front on this. I think everybody else is catching up. So I think this conversation about excess deposits is not unique to State Street anymore, but I think we executed the plan pretty well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just a clarification Mike on the timing of the run rate for expenses the $75 million and the $125 million for 2016 and 2017 respectively, is that a 4Q '16 and 4Q '17 annualized run rate or rather a full year which should imply higher 4Q run rate? Mike Bell : Brian, this is a full year comparison, so the $75 million is full year '16 versus full year '15 and importantly is a net number to operating expenses. So for example we're going to have some IT spending and just overall programs spending in Q1 and that will continue throughout the year. The $75 million is the gross savings minus the investment spending that I just mentioned. Importantly, it doesn't include any potential restructuring charges. I would suspect that a portion of that $300 million to $400 million of overall expected restructuring charges over the period 2016 to 2020 some of that may impact 2016, that would not be included in the $75 million. Brian Bedell : Right, okay, so then just to imply that as you work through the quarters and we get to the fourth quarter the run rates will be higher than the full year run rate moving into next years? Mike Bell : Yes, that's likely fair. I think the only reason I hesitate a little bit is that the investment spending, particularly the IT spending is somewhat of a fluid situation. So again we will be focused on the net. But I think your modeling assumption is a fair one. Brian Bedell : Okay great. Just lastly one the FX trading, I know the direct sales component of the FX declined much more than the indirect. I guess Jay, is there anything FX product with that other aside from the lower market volatility and would you expect that given what we know about FX volatility in client volumes, do you expect that to rebound in 1Q on that part of it? Jay Hooley : I would say, Brian, it's feels to me more episodic than anything that is a trend line and I think that our volumes were pretty much in line with what we saw in the industry, volatility hung in as now I would view it more of an episodic. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions in queue. Jay Hooley : Thank you for your time and attention this morning and look forward to hopefully seeing all of you in New York on February 24th. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

As with the past couple of quarters, we have instituted a new pattern of releasing our financial results on the fourth Wednesday of the month following each quarter end. As such, we expect to hold our second quarter earnings call on Wednesday, July 27 2016. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Anthony and good morning, everyone. Despite the challenging environment, I'm pleased with the progress we've made during the quarter on the five strategic priorities I outlined for you at our Investor Day in February. These priorities will help us to transform State Street, compete in the new environment and deliver value in the short-term. As a reminder, these priorities are, one, to become a digital leader in financial services, to drive growth from our core franchise, to invest in new products that will enhance revenue and drive differentiation, increased our focus on expense management and leverage our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders. As you can see on Slide 4 of the slide deck, we've outlined for you highlights of our progress so far this year against those five priorities. First, on becoming a digital leader in financial services. We are investing in becoming a digital leader in financial services through State Street Beacon; our journey to digitize core processes will deliver an enhanced client experience and generate $550 million in annual pretax net run rate expense savings by the end of 2020. Our clients are already begin to see the results of our investments through faster and more consistent delivery of services impacting our clients operations and driving improved ranking within distribution channels. We are also actively engaged in evaluating new technologies such as block-chain. We remain on track to achieve State Street Beacon related annualized run rate savings of $100 million by the end of this year. That amount will be reflected in our 2017 results. As we indicated could be the case at our Investor Day, we did take a pretax restructuring charge of $97 million in the first quarter related to Beacon. Second, we expect our core franchise to continue to deliver growth given our leading positions and attractive markets. Although our first quarter fee revenue reflects a challenging market environment experienced at the beginning of the year, we are encouraged by the signs of stability in March and the strength of our pipeline across the firm. The first quarter included new asset servicing wins of approximately $264 billion, but approximately $400 billion of service commitments remaining at quarter end to be installed from current and prior periods. I want to highlight when that our Global Services Group in Asia Pacific recently finalized. In early March, we were selected to be the master custodian for Australia's third largest superannuation fund, First State Super. This new relationship will also extend into globe markets and our global exchange businesses. Of note, State Street now services four of the seven largest superfund and what is the high-growth sector for us in Australia. I'm also pleased to say that our asset management business has inflows of $13 billion with expected annualized net new revenue of $11 million during the quarter providing the strongest quarterly net flow in annualized revenue results since the fourth quarter of 2014. That activity was driven primarily by $7 billion of inflows into ETFs and $11 billion of inflows into cash products. Third, we believe continuous investment in new products and solutions will enhance revenue and drive differentiation. Our recent agreement to acquire GE Asset Management supports our strategy to invest in higher growth and return businesses. GE Asset Management significantly enhances our position in the outsourced CIO market, which is one of the faster growing segments of the asset management business. Additionally, GE Asset Management expands SSGAs alternative capabilities, while enhancing our active equity and fixed income teams, which broadened the solution sets we can provide to our combined client base. Most importantly, GE Asset Management is a high-quality organization with strong cultural alignment with SSGA and this transaction is an endorsement of our ongoing and strong long-term relationship with GE. We expect this acquisition to be accretive in the first 12 months of operation. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate products that are not meeting our strategic or financial expectations. We made the decision during the quarter to exit our futures clearing business, at the beginning of the second quarter we completed the sale of the WM/Reuters branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters. These and other ongoing return on capital actions are aimed at improving our efficiency, strategic focus and ROE over the medium to long-term. Innovation is a critical differentiator in the competitive ETF segment and a key focus for SSGA. Our SSGA, our spider ETF business introduced 13 new funds during the quarter including the SSGA gender diversity ETF. She is the first self indexed ETF, and its development was inspired by CalSTRS efforts to move the needle on gender diversity in corporate America and seeks to track performance of the SSGA gender diversity index which comprises large -- U.S. large cap companies with the highest levels within their sectors of gender diversity on their Board of Directors and in their senior leadership. Fourth, we are increasing our focus on expense management. Our results this quarter reflect our commitment to manage expenses with first quarter operating expenses flat compared to the same period a year ago and also flat excluding the seasonal impact of equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We continue to make expense discipline core to our culture encouraging employees to embrace and owners mindset and identify ways we can reduce cost across the enterprise looking at everything from travel to consultant spend. As I noted earlier, State Street Beacon is contributing to our expense management efforts and we are on track to generate at least $100 million in annualized pretax net run rate expense savings this year from the program. And fifth, we're leveraging our strong capital position to continue to return capital to shareholders. Our first quarter 2016 common stock dividend was $0.34 per share and we purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock. We expect to repurchase up to $390 million of our common stock in 2Q 2016. As I've just reviewed for you, we will continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective of generating positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2016. Two weeks ago, the Fed Reserve and FDIC released their review of our July 2015 RRP submission. Both the Federal Reserve and the FDIC noted that we have made improvements over our prior plans, but determined that our 2015 resolution plan is not credible. While disappointed with the findings, we are committed to addressing the issues and enhancing our resolution plan as our business and regulatory requirements evolve. We've had ongoing communications with the regulator and are focused on addressing all the deficiencies jointly identified by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC by October 1, 2016. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike, who'll review our financial performance for the first quarter and then we'll both be available to take your questions. Mike Bell : Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone. This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I like to note that our GAAP basis results for the first quarter included pretax restructuring costs of $97 million related to State Street Beacon including the exit of our Futures Clearing Business. Now turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for 1Q 2016. 1Q 2016 results reflect softness in our fee revenue primarily driven by lower global equity markets, partially offset by strong expense control. Operating basis EPS for 1Q 2016 decreased to $0.98 a share from $1.16 in 1Q 2015 and decreased from $1.21 in 4Q 2015. Our first quarter results in 2015 and 2016 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive comp for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Importantly, total expenses were approximately flat compared to the year ago quarter. And excluding the noted seasonal retirement eligible expenses and payroll taxes, total expenses were approximately flat compared to 4Q 2015. Regarding capital in 1Q 2016, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased approximately $325 million of our common stock. Moving now to Slide 9, 1Q 2016 fee revenue decreased 3.6% while expenses were approximately flat versus a year ago. Weakness in global equity markets and elevated 1Q 2015 FX revenue resulting from the Swiss National Bank actions at that time contributed to the decrease in fee revenue relative to the year ago quarter. I'll now turn to Slide 11 for a review of our 1Q 2016 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year ago quarter primarily due to the lower global equity markets and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar partially offset by net new business. The decrease in the international equity markets particularly in emerging markets negatively impacted first quarter servicing fees. Compared to the year ago quarter, average daily values for the Morgan Stanley Emerging Market Index decreased 22%, while the EAFE Equity Index was down approximately 12%. Management fees decreased relative to a year ago reflecting global equity markets and net outflows partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from the strong market activity in 1Q 2015 due to lower volatility in volumes nevertheless that increase relative to 4Q 2015. Securities finance revenue increased from 1Q 2015 and 4Q 2015, the increase over both periods reflects increased revenue from both enhanced custody and agency lending. Compared to 4Q 2015 processing and other revenue decreased reflecting lower equity earnings from joint ventures and lower revenues associated with tax advantaged investments. Moving to Slide 12, I would note that our operating basis, 1Q 2016 net interest revenue benefited from the higher Fed funds rate and disciplined liability pricing. Debt interest revenue decreased from a year ago primarily driven by the successful reduction in the size of our balance sheet. Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review 1Q 2016 operating basis expenses. Importantly total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 1Q 2016 and were approximately flat relative to 1Q 2015 a notable accomplishment. Compensation and employee benefits were impacted by the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for the retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes, demonstrating solid expense control the other expense category decreased significantly as compared to both 1Q 2015 and 4Q 2015. Compared to 4Q 2015 over other expense were driven lower professional services fees and travel expenses as well as the settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Now, turn to Slide 15 to review our capital position. As you can see our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to accomplish a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock purchases. Compared to December 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the Basel III fully phased in advanced approach and remained approximately flat under the standardized approach. Importantly, the March 31 fully phased and supplementary leverage ratio at the bank increased to 6.2% primarily due to an increase in Tier 1 capital. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 1Q 2016 and expect to repurchase up to $390 million in 2Q 2016, this will put us approximately $65 million below our gross share repurchase program of $1.83 billion. The $65 million difference represents the reduction in our 1Q 2016 equity compensation for our employees relative to what we've expected at the time our capital plan was approved. The net repurchased amount is therefore consistent with the capital plan. Moving on to the next Slide. Let me briefly discuss our agreement to acquire GE asset management. What remains a top priority to return capital to shareholders through common stock repurchase and dividends, we also are focused on allocating capital to higher growth and return businesses. The agreement to acquire GE Asset Management reflects this plan. The purchase price is $435 million subject to adjustments with up to an additional $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration charges, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first 12-month period following the close of the transaction and we're targeting a client asset retention rate of at least 90%. Importantly, the acquisition will significantly enhance State Street's position in the fast growing outsourced chief investment officer market. Moving to Slide 17, I will now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Despite the pressure on global equity markets in the first quarter, we are encouraged that the environment improved in March. Importantly, compared to January and February, servicing and management fees improved in March. On the expense front, we continue to expect operating basis expense growth of up to 2% for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 with variability across quarters. We also continue to expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 2015. Please note my comments related to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Also, we're on track to generate at least $100 million in estimated annual pretax net run rate expense savings from State Street Beacon by the end of 2016. Now as a reminder, upward pressure on regulatory and compliance cost is expected to continue throughout 2016. However, we expect the growth rate to be lower than full year 2015 relative to 2014. We also expect expense growth to be affected by the volume of new business as well as continued investments. In addition, we continue to have two scenarios for 2016 net interest revenue largely consistent with prior communications. The first scenario assumes market interest rates remain static at March 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. The second scenario assumes administered rates in the U.S. increased 25 basis points in both June and December and correspondingly market rates to trend higher from 2016 levels. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2016 NIR to be in a range of approximately $2.1 billion $2.2 billion. We continue to expect the 2016 operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%. And lastly, I would emphasize, that returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends remains a priority. Our 2016 capital plan remains subject to the results of the 2016 CCAR process including a review from the Federal Reserve Board. In summary, although the revenue environment remains challenging as reflected in 1Q 2016 results, we are encouraged that fee revenue gained momentum in March and we remain focused on prudently managing expenses and providing solutions to our clients. Let me turn the call back over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks Mike. Therese, we are now available to open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ashley Serrao [Credit Suisse]. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Ashley Serrao : First question just on expenses and Beacon, I'm curious what the run rate benefit to 1Q results was? Mike Bell : Ashley, good morning, it's Mike. In Q1 as compared to Q4, so on a sequential basis, we had net savings of approximately $7 million. And we had noted that the Investor Day that we did expect a fair amount of spending for Beacon and we had that but as I said the net savings in Q1 was approximately $7 million sequentially. Ashley Serrao : Okay, so still fairly early innings there. Okay. And just two, and if I look at net interest revenue this quarter and the sequential jump in NIM, what drove the increasing yields on the other asset bucket? Mike Bell : I would point to a couple of things. And I wouldn't characterize it, Ashley, as just the impact on the other asset bucket, but there were a couple of things that broadly helped us. First of all, as we've discussed before, we have a significant amount of our balance sheet that is in floating rate assets. So that's a combination of the Central Bank deposits that we have here in the U.S. That includes the floating rate securities in the securities portfolio about half of the floating rate securities are in U.S., so that's approximately $18 billion. And then, we also, our loans tend to be also a floating rate asset. So basically the floating rate assets in our balance sheet increased, as you would expect, based upon the increase in short-term market interest rates. In addition, we also were able to capture a wider spread on client repo and we also saw increased netting for repos. So those two things combined increased what you see on the average rates earned and paid page that increased significantly the average rate for the assets that are in the repo securities category. Ad then, in the other interest earning asset line that you specifically ask about, that's our enhanced custody asset and basically that just reflects the market rate increase as a result of short-term rates being higher. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin [Jefferies]. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Just -- one more follow-up on the NII front then Mike. So, do you normalize for some of those helpers because if I take what you're saying about that and just think about the fact that you've left the -- without rate band unchanged, it would seem that even to get down to that high-end of that X rate span, you're talking about more like a 5, 10 type of net interest income run rate. So, can you just kind of help us just walk through how much of that first quarter goes away, and then, the other typical pushes and pulls in terms of any lingering yield compression versus balance sheet shrinkage we should be thinking about. Mike Bell : Sure, absolutely. Ken, good morning. The couple of things that we expect in the static rate scenario, Ken, the couple of things that we expect to put downward pressure on our NIR under the static scenario would be number one, the grind in the fixed rate portion of the portfolio. So I mentioned that approximately $36 billion of our portfolio is floating rate about half of that is in the U.S. that benefited from the short-term rate hike. About half of that is outside the U.S., which obviously did not benefit from the short-term rate hike. But in the fixed rate category, which is approximately $66 billion of the portfolio, we're seeing this grind where the rate on the investments that are maturing is approximately 100 to 150 basis points higher than the new fixed rate investments that we're making with the proceeds from those maturities. So that grind over the course of the year is a negative. And as we talked about before, in Europe, the situation is still relatively negative in that not only are the short-term interest rates negative with the ECB, but in addition to that because of the quantitative easing program over there, spreads are really teeny as well. So, the grind in the portfolio in Europe as well is putting downward pressure. So in the static rates scenario, we would expect those to be the big drivers of the lower NIR in the next several quarters. If instead though, we get a couple more Fed fund hikes, we wouldn't expect them to be quite as accretive as what we saw in first quarter, but obviously, we would expect it to be net-net helpful as we get a higher rate on the floating rate assets that I mentioned in response to Ashley's question. Ken Usdin : Great. Thanks Mike. And just a second question on expenses. Great start on the flat year-over-year, but you're also keeping up to 2% full year into your point about the compliance builds and also the volatility quarter-to-quarter. We are also implying that expenses do have a distinct upward trail from here? Because it would seem like you are on a better trajectory. Why couldn't you do better than that 2% guidance you had given us at Investor Day? Mike Bell : Yes. First, Ken, I appreciate the compliment on the first quarter results. We are really pleased with that. And as we talked about at the Investor Day, we continue to look at really every signal area of expenses. And I think we did a particularly good job in Q1 at reducing the outside consulting expenses, some of it regulatory, cost some of it not regulatory. We reduced travel expenses significantly in Q1. But, I do expect that there'll be a march up in regulatory expenses in Q2, Q3, Q4 as a result of dealing with the higher expectations. Now, having said that, we'll continue to look at every area of expense. As Jay talked about, project Beacon continued to be on track for the expected $100 million savings for the full year. But, again, between the regulatory costs and net new business that we expect to be coming onboard that will need expense to service. We thought it made sense to stick with the -- to say up to 2% on expense growth. And obviously, a lot of where we'll end up will also relate to where the fee revenue ends up as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr [Evercore]. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Two business questions. First one is on enhanced custody and agency lending. You mentioned the wider spreads, or I should say the growth in the higher short-term rates. But, curious on just overall balances in progress of the business, it seems to be growing fast. You talked about it in the past, but what are the goals in terms of how much you want to grow at and what risk -- let me rephrase that, what capital charges go along with growing that business? Jay Hooley : Glenn, let me start that one. You've seen not just this quarter, but progressive quarter's good performance, out performance in securities lending. And you're right this quarter was a combination of agency and enhanced custody. I would say over a longer cycle, it's really been enhanced custody that has driven the disproportionate growth. And we expect that will continue. That continues to be high demand in our -- not only hedge, but in our traditional client base to use enhanced custody as opposed to some of the traditional means of credit. And we don't see much limitation. I'd say most of the business growth that we're seeing quarter-to-quarter it is existing clients doing more credit extension with us. So, we built out the product, I think I mentioned last quarter. We're building it out in Europe and Asia as we would do normally for all of our products. The ability to net the securities lending back against the broader portfolio makes it an attractive proposition from a capital standpoint. So net-net, we've seen continued demand. We don't see much in the way of capacity constraints and we think we've figured out how to make this attractive from return on capital standpoint. Glenn Schorr : ROE better than the overall company's ROE, I'm just curious if it's driving -- you ever increasing capital ratios or that's just all regulatory\u2026 Jay Hooley : Glenn, it's a little bit less, but I would say steadily improving over the last couple of years. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, Jay. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Alex Blostein [Goldman Sachs]. Alex Blostein : Good morning, guys. Question on the Living Will issue from a couple weeks ago. You know, what do you guys as far as the next steps go, what do you expect to do to address the issues especially when it comes to the capital concern that came out of their statement? And do anticipate this to have any impact on CCAR for you guys, whether probably not so much in the quantitative piece but more on the qualitative? Mike Bell : Sure. Good morning, Alex, it's Mike. First of all, I don't view the capital piece, the capital item that was noted as a deficiency as being a significant problem for us to deal with. And I do not expect at this point in time that that would have an impact on CCAR. And obviously, Fed will make the judgments that they'll make, but I have no indication at this point that that would have a negative impact. So, really what we're focused on now is better understanding the regulatory expectations both for the October 1 deliverable as well as the submission next July 1. And so that more broadly is what we are focus on. And as Jay indicated in his prepared remarks, we are certainly committed to doing everything in our power to meeting their expectations. Alex Blostein : Got you. And then, Jay, follow up for you on the GE acquisition. You guys talked about pretty robust growth, I guess in that business. But my understanding is that something like 90% or so, CIO versus GE pension assets that are obviously sticky there. But I not sure how growth those are. So give us a sense of what the organic growth has been in that business prior to your acquisition, and then maybe what you guys anticipate to see from again the organic growth part of the business? Jay Hooley : Sure. Happy to take that one up, Alex. As you point out, a good deal of the assets are GE assets, both their pension which is how the whole thing got started, outsourcing the CIO function of GE's pension assets. But they've also been successful in attracting some other big names in the outsourced CIO marketplace. So I think that if you just look at that segment of the market particularly against an environment were rates are likely to be low for a protracted period of time. We think that's a growth market. And we think by kind of unshackling GE from GE and making it part of the State Street that will be more attractive provider of services in the outsourced CIO market. So they've had some growth on their own, we've also had some growth. By combining it we think we can grow at a faster rate. So that's core to the growth opportunity. But also core of the growth opportunity is, you've heard us talk before about a natural place where we play very effectively in the asset management world is in solutions. And whether it's a target date fund or outsourced CIO or many other versions of solutions. And we had a little bit of a deficit in several asset classes particularly alternatives. And so again, by taking our natural solutions capabilities and enhancing it with some of GE's very credible asset management components in the alternatives, real estate, private equity and hedge, all three, we think we can accelerate our solutions growth. So it's really taking, I'd say a very high-quality and stable asset management organization and bedding at State Street and true synergies of the revenue side. And the OCIO and solutions segments of the market. Alex Blostein : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell [Buckingham Research]. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe, you could talk a little bit about euro deposits. It sounds like you raised the fee charged on those. Have you seen any runoff that's material or is it a little too early to tell we see that in the second quarter. How do we think about your clients' reaction to raising rates? Mike Bell : Sure, Jim. Good morning, it's Mike. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Mike Bell : We did as you suggested, we did increase the rate that we are charging for euro deposits. We did see approximately $2 billion of run-off on average Q1 versus Q4. The discussions with clients are ongoing. I would say at this point, it feels like a relatively well-managed situation, but it's something that we're obviously paying close attention to given the challenging conditions in Europe. Jay Hooley : Hey Jim, let me just chip in something. I would say on this whole charging for negative rates, we were market leaders in that. And as I look across the landscape, we're not alone anymore. So whether it's the U.S. banks, the European banks, the environment has shifted to be supportive of this activity. So I think that helps from a standpoint of being able to raise rates and retain the deposits that we want. Jim Mitchell : Right. And so it seems like deposits have held in a little bit better than maybe you expect it. Is that part of the upside we see in NII this quarter relative to your full year forecast? Jay Hooley : Jim, I would characterize it as they are pretty much tracking with what we expected. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And if I could just ask one on the Tier 1 capital at the bank, it seems like you downstream some capital there. Is that true? How is that accomplished to boost the Tier 1 on the SLR bank? Mike Bell : Sure. In terms of just administratively how we did it, we basically just retained some earnings at the bank as opposed to dividending that from the bank to the HoldCo. But as we've talked about in the past, Jim, we do recognize that we've got some flexibility in terms of what assets we hold at the HoldCo versus what we have at the bank. So this was really normal management in line with our plan to be sure that we were above 6% in time for 118. Obviously, the fact that the balance sheet got smaller as well was also helpful in that regard. Jim Mitchell : Right. Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell [Deutsche Bank]. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning, folks. Jay Hooley : Good morning, Brian. Brian Bedell : Mike, just to circle back on the securities repo line, the yield going from 236 to 586, it's about -- looks like around $30 million sequential increase. Can you just explain that dynamic again and what you would expect the normalized rate to be in the second quarter on that? Mike Bell : Sure, Brian. Well, first of all, I wouldn't focus as much on the 586 as I would on just the overall contribution from that line item. But again, first talk about the change in the numerator. As we talked about in one of the earlier questions, we did earn a higher spread, a wider spread on client repo in the first quarter. Basically, as short-term market interest rates increased, we were able to capture that in our margin. The thing that makes the average rate jump as much as it did though, is that we also expanded netting in the quarter. So as a result, we actually had expanded activity for our clients in the quarter, but we were able to net more of it. So the average balance you see there dropped by about $0.5 billion or about 16% sequentially. But it was -- that was really from the netting. So the overall activity expanded. The spreads expanded, but as a result, the average balance been dropped. I wouldn't say, I think that was a combination of good management and good market conditions. And I would expect that market conditions will remain relatively good in the near-term, but it's something certainly we can't guarantee and it's something that we manage and monitor everyday. Brian Bedell : It seem as though $30 million, you would view as somewhat or that $30 million increase, you would view as somewhat sustainable or would you see that river back somewhat? Mike Bell : I think that, again, time will tell Brian. I don't have a perfect crystal ball. But, I would expect that perhaps the majority of the sequential increase in those spreads should be sustained over the next couple of quarters. But again, it will be depending upon market conditions. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. And then, maybe Jay, if you want to comment a little bit about the typical dividend arbitrage season and in Europe there's been some discussion of curtailing that. Are you seeing the same type of activity that you typically see in securities lending and FX trading coming into the second quarter or do you expect that to be a little bit strange? Jay Hooley : Brian you point out second quarter is a seasonal peak for us with regard to the dividend activity. It's been a lot of attention on that over the last couple of years. So, we probably see some slight diminishment from what we've seen in past. I don't think it's material, but probably not quite at the peak it's been in past years because of all the attention that trade has received. Brian Bedell : Great, thank you. I'll get back in the queue for some follow-ups. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes Betsy Graseck [Morgan Stanley]. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to begin on two things. One was on the Beacon project, you indicated the restructuring charge of $97 million this quarter. Obviously, a net savings this quarter of $7 million. I know you're investing $500 million, you're investing $40 million to get a $500 million benefit over five years, but could you give us a sense to how we should think about the investment and the space as we go through the rest of this year? Because I thought it was front-end loaded? So I just wanted to make sure I have the numbers right there. Mike Bell : Sure, Betsy. It's Mike. I do expect that both the benefits as well as the investments that we're making in project Beacon will both steadily increase over the course of 2016. I do expect that the net benefit will increase each of those three quarters. On the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, I also do expect to see some upward pressure on regulatory cost. So again, that's several moving parts, but I would think in Beacon in particular as both investments continuing to increase and savings continuing to increase. Betsy Graseck : And all of the $97 million in investment was largely in severance and I'm assuming that's the -- kind of below the net line number. You're not anticipating any investments in the Beacon project to be in operating expenses are you? Mike Bell : Yes. We are Betsy. In fact, we did see investments in that area in operating expenses that was both in compensation, but it's also in the information systems line. And again, I would expect to see additional spending in the information systems line over the course of 2016. Betsy Graseck : And then, on your slide, you indicated, obviously that strategic priority to be a digital leader in financial services. Could you just break apart a little bit the one-liner you have there actively testing new technologies such as block-chain? Could you give us a sense as to what you are doing there? Jay Hooley : Happy to do that, Betsy. This is Jay. Block-chain as we see, it's appropriately a lot of attention and I think it's -- to me it's synonymous with digitization generally. I think if I would've put some perspective on -- put into perspective Beacon and block-chain, I would say that Beacon is our effort internally to digitize within the four walls of State Street. I think that importantly, the whole developed markets, financial services infrastructure needs to be digitized and that's going to require standardization between firms and between activities. So that's really where I see block-chain being most relevant. We have internally within our Beacon effort, we've got I think it's four, maybe five pilots going on to use block-chain as a means to digitize within State Street, linked to other firms. So let me give you the best example, maybe be the most easily explained example. Bank loan processing has been an activity that State Street has developed a significant share of the market and processing a bank loan requires many intermediaries to come together in a common ledger to exchange information. So we have a pilot going on in our bank loan processing group where we're using block-chain. And we've got agreement from all the counterparties to participate in a block-chain pilot around bank loan processing. So what that would do is take an activity where there's process improvements and technology that we need to do internally within State Street, but it would extend it to other counterparties. So we've got several of those going on which we think could be helpful to us. I think that probably the bigger comment I would make is that we'll digitize our own environment, but it will require standards across the industry and again, block-chain maybe one of those. We are participating in a group called R3. I think there's up to 16 banking institutions that are trying to figure out what the application -- what the best applications are to use block-chain in order to create standards inter-company, inter-industry. And so I think we're going to absolutely do what we need to do to digitize our environment. I think the home run here is, if we can get some standards developed around how we will interoperate from a digital standpoint and I think block-chain could be, if it's not block-chain it will be something else, one of the standards that emerged that allow the interoperability at a digital level in the whole industry. I don't know if that confuses or helps, but that's how I view it. We can control, we can control that's what we're doing with Beacon. But in order for this really to work, the industry needs to digitize. Block-chain\u2026 Betsy Graseck : That's helpful, it's just a question of, is it a product by product and what kind of timeframe do you see to potentially take something like the pilot that you're working on to either have a go or no go decision with some benefits to you. Jay Hooley : Yes. I guess is, it's product by product at this point. And so bank loans is one of those products, one of those services. I'd be surprised if within a year we don't know whether it would be the right answer to that issue. And I think as with many things, if we get a bunch of financial institutions to converge around a problem and use a new tool. if successful, it will grow from there. And I think it's got a decent chance of succeeding. But, it'll be one of many solutions versus the silver bullet. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Adam Beatty [Bank of America]. Adam Beatty : Good morning. I have a question about product strategies and ETFs. Appreciate the details earlier. It seems like State Street and others have come out with some fairly niche offerings recently. And the question is with a lot of the big indexes and exposures already being covered including by some State Street products, is that the feature of ETF innovation kind of like television where there is 300 channels, where everybody can see exactly what they want? Or if that's not the whole story, how does that fit into your overall product strategy? Thanks. Jay Hooley : I think I appreciate the question, Adam I just remind you that our ETF strategy is really two tracks. One is to continue to build out the distribution, which we're doing in the U.S. and also Europe. And then to your point, it's enhancing the product. And I'd say, a lot of the basic beta strategies have been consumed in an ETF product. But then, you get to the next level of customized indexes. So the SHE index that I described in our prepared comments is using a -- is developing a strategy and developed in this case, this is the first time we have self indexed. So we built the index, back tested it, and then, packaged it in an ETF. You'll see more and more of that happening. In fact, we are not the only ones doing that I think in the broad beta and ETF space that's a theme. The other thing I would say is that I would point to maybe the partnership we have with DoubleLine where they're taking active fixed income strategies. They are the manager, who are packaging it in the ETF and disturbing it. And I think you're going to see more and more encroachment into traditional products basis and I come a little short because I'm not quite sold yet, you'll take active equity products, for instance, and wrap it in an ETF, but others would take the other side of that argument. So I don't really see much limitation for investment strategies being able to be wrapped and packaged in an ETF structure and distributed to both institutions and the retail market space. So we have, I would say that SSGA has deployed kind of an open platform strategy where if we can create the index in the case of SHE, manufacture and distribute, then we will. But if there's an interesting investment idea outside of SSGA, we're willing to discuss packaging and distributing which we've done not just with DoubleLine but with Nuveen, MFS and several other firms. Hope that helps. Adam Beatty : Yes, it does Thank you very much, Jay. And then, a question on the OCIO business in the context of asset servicing, how much synergy -- revenue synergy would you expect in terms of asset servicing, and if so in what areas? Is it possible that the GE acquisition benefits from being housed from that standpoint in an organization like State Street ? Jay Hooley : Yes. I think it's a good question. And one of the reasons we have a 25-year-old relationship with GE is, we've been the back end of the front end OCIO business that GE has run over these years. So I think that as I mentioned before, the Outsourcing of the Chief Investment Officer function for these defined benefit plans is likely to be a growing opportunity, growth opportunity. You're already seeing it today. The fact that we can go in and not only offer the front office expertise of how to run these plans, how to speak the language of DB to trustees and other customer facing, pension organizations, but also be able to fully integrate the back office complete with asset servicing, middle office securities lending everything that goes with it, is all relevant here. So I see the more OCIO business we get it should naturally bring all the middle and back office business with it. Adam Beatty : Excellent. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Your question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Hey, good morning. Just one quick follow-up at this point. The decline in other expenses, I think the implication was that you had some benefit here. I think you weighed out the consultant expenses coming down but the reason why the guy didn't go up is because you've got some upward pressure pending from potential Living Will spend and such. Am I paraphrasing that correctly? Am I reading through your comments right or should you, can you clarify please? Mike Bell : Brennan, it's Mike. I think those are fair comments, but I wouldn't limit the upward regulatory cost pressure to just the Living Wills. I think it's broader than that. But other than that your comment is very fair. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then, is there a way to unpack the other expense result here that was better than expected and how much independently you think might be sustainable beyond then the pending upward pressure from here? Is there a way to think about that separately? Mike Bell : Well, I would just remind you that we're still guiding to up to 2% overall expense growth year-over-year excluding the acquisition of GE Asset Management. So the fact that that's the case, says to me that we are going to manage expenses really in aggregate. And obviously, our preferred route would be to continue to build in-house capabilities, hire full-time people to manage and run these regulatory and compliance activities and rely less and less on outside consultants. And so if we continue to be successful in that area, then I think that line item will likely run below last year's. But again, it really is a question of managing those priorities in aggregate as opposed to just focusing on one line item. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Jay Hooley : Vivek? Operator : It looks like Vivek withdrew his question. Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes. Thanks and good morning. Quick question on the GE Asset Management, and I know you gave guidance as to what the expected accretion to be for one year and also you want to retain 90% with regards to the AUM. But, we would assume that the one-year is just because that's when the lockup period is, for those assets or is there a longer lockup on the assets being acquired? Mike Bell : Brian, I wouldn't relate the two. Basically, we're focused on the first 12 months because we wanted to give you a time period at which we expect this to be accretive to EPS. And so that really is irrespective of any kind of lockup period with the GE plan. Jay Hooley : And I'd add, Brian that our expectation is that the 90% plus business that we retained will have a long life to it. Brian Kleinhanzl : So I guess asked differently, when does the lockup period end? Mike Bell : There is not a contractual lockup period. Basically we're confident that we can continue to meet the GE pension plans needs and that's what we will be focused on. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. And then, just a second question. What's the impact on the revenues from the exit of the Futures Clearing business, I guess what's the impact on the pretax margin as well? Mike Bell : Sure. So Brian, the SCM business earned $9 million in fees in full year 2015. And the expenses were greater than that but we are part of the overall savings that I talked about earlier in terms of Beacon. So I wouldn't be more specific at this point. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. On the resolution plan, could you talk about what you need to do their and how much of that is simply around changing the plan versus how much is around making changes in the way business is structured, the amounts of liquidity that you hold, how capital is allocated between different types of fees and so on? Mike Bell : So, Geoff, it's Mike. I would say it is early days to be real specific on the actions that will -- it will take to ultimately meet the regulatory expectations. You saw the same information that we did in terms of the keeper that lays out expectations for July 1, 2017 submission. And I think we'll be in ongoing dialogue with both the Federal Reserve as well as the FDIC over the next at least 12 months to make sure that we specifically understand them. So I think it's going to be a combination of all the things that you just described there's likely to be some additional infrastructure to be built. Some of it will be additional modeling capabilities. Some of it will be additional monitoring capabilities and also as you correctly indicated, I would expect to see additional legal entity simplification over time as well. But I really think it's a little bit too early to try to be specific until we have more ongoing dialogue with both groups. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. And then, just to follow-up on the previous question on the not being a contractual lockup on the GE Asset Management assets, why not -- had a thought that when your acquiring a manager and the vast majority of the assets are in-house, that would be absolutely critical to making sure you don't just get the one-year accretion, but the accretion, three, four, five, 10 years out? Jay Hooley : I would say, Geoff it's a pension plan, so it has a list of restrictions. If you look at SSG, probably the biggest segment that they manage for our pension plans and they do that and as long as they are fulfilling their return expectations, it's unlikely that that changes. And so, GE has been managing this plan for a long time. These are -- we see in our business, the OCIO market very sticky assets. So I don't frankly view it as -- I view it as not a concern at all as long as we do what we are being asked to do, which we do everyday for many customers around the world, then we think these assets will be with us for a time. And the fact that we are going to combine it with our business gives us more scale and expertise and it will make us the more attractive counterparty for other pension plans that want to outsource that. I view it as a stable, sticky series of assets with some capabilities we don't have today that will allow us to grow the base. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Jay Hooley : Great. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Can you guys share with us on the new business when it's on the net asset servicing side of about $264 billion, what percentage of that was the first State Super Australia win? And then second, what's the pipeline work for the second quarter? Jay Hooley : Let me take that one Gerard. I can't give you a First State Super, but what I would tell you is that of $264 billion a little bit unusually, 50% of that came from Asia Pacific. So we've been running more probably 60/40 U.S., non-U.S for this quarter, was more 70 :30, 30% being U.S., 70% non-U.S. So good progress in Asia Pacific , really anchored in not only Australia which I highlighted, but we've also seen some movement in Japan where we've seen the first outsourcing of investment trust funds, something we've been pursuing for a long time. So that's the first question. The second, pipelines are quite full. I think that, I said this before, but if you look at the asset owner and maybe more specifically, the asset management segment, between difficulty and achieving above benchmark returns to increasing regulatory pressure, we've never seen the demand for things like middle office outsourcing that we have on our plate right now. And importantly, in that particular product, there's a willingness to accept standardized services. So I feel very good about the pipeline, not only from a geographic standpoint, but across, in particular asset managers, but asset service -- asset owners as well. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then, maybe Mike, when we look at your average balance sheet that give us in the supplement on Page 11. I noticed that the interest-bearing deposits in the United States, the yield on that or the cost, I should say to you guys, jumped from 23 basis points to 40 basis points. And then, quite a bit different than some of your peers. What caused it to jump up that much? Mike Bell : Sure, Gerard. First of all, the main driver in that category is actually the cost of our wholesale CDs. So we have approximately $15 billion on average of wholesale CD balances in Q1. And those moved with LIBOR rates. And so that's the driver of the sequential increase there. If we strip those out and just at what the interest-bearing DDA that was pretty close to flat sequentially. So it's really the wholesale CDs. Gerard Cassidy : And the CDs as a percentage of the total that you just gave us, is that consistent with those prior periods? Or is it a greater percentage today than it was in those prior periods? Mike Bell : It's probably a slightly smaller percentage today at $15 billion. We use the wholesale CDs as a management tool around liquidity and those balances were actually a little bit higher in 2015. I remember the rates were lower because LIBOR was lower in 2015 than what it is in Q1 2016. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of things. Firstly, Mike, just following up on the question you're talking about on the repo market, you said majority of the increasing spreads can be sustained in the next couple of quarters? Can you give us a little more color on what's going on in that market structurally that's causing this widening in spreads and that will sustain it? Mike Bell : Sure, Vivek. I mean really it's a combination of the fact that short-term interest rates have obviously gone up with the Fed fund hike. And it's also just a function of supply and demand. And so we will monitor those conditions carefully, but I see nothing that would suggest that that's going to evaporate here in Q2. So again, it's something that we will pay close attention to. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks. Just shifting gears, Jay, to look at your asset management business, if I look at the operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13%, and if I look at full year asset management margin was 19 and change, 15% for the fourth quarter and 19 in change, the really low margin compared to peers. You talked a little bit about specifically that business what you can do to first even moving things like ETF, what you can do to accelerate the operating margin improvement and why so far behind peers? Jay Hooley : Sure, Vivek. I'm happy to take that. We're not pleased with the margin in the SSGA business, I think I said that before. And we do think by reorienting around the strategic priorities that we laid out back in February which are anchored in ETF solutions, OCIO as an additional category that we're getting the right level of focus and investing at the right amount in order to drive really top-line and also create more efficiency through the focus. And I think that if you look over an extended period of time, you would have seen we've hit a trough with regard to returns. And I feel like the investments that we've been making are starting to create some traction. And I look at ETFs and really solutions as being the cornerstone of that. In addition to some of the positioning we have in markets outside the U.S., again, I would look to those same two cornerstone elements. So we're working on it. We think we're making the right investments. I think focus is important. SSGA in some respects does not have a lot of pure comps given what it does. And we're trying to be very good at a couple of things and do them well globally. And I think we're on the right track. Vivek Juneja : And do you think it will be sooner in SSGA in terms of -- you're not talking about overall company operating margin improvement, do you see SSGA doing same timeframe or sooner, Jay, compared to the servicing business? Jay Hooley : I got two views on that Vivek. One is, yes, sooner, because we're making proportionally more investments than the SSGA business. And I think, you also need to come back to one of the comments we made around the GE acquisition. As we look at our different businesses within State Street and look at returns, SSGA has disproportionately higher return as does a businesslike Global Exchange. So as we look at investing in areas that we think have natural growth upside and in addition would be accretive to our return on equity, we are going to proportionally lead in that direction. And so I think for those reasons, I would expect that you would see SSGA improve sooner than the rest of the franchise. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And our final question comes from Brian Bedell, it's a follow-up question with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : The assets under administration looks like there was a significant decline in the pension product area from $5.5 trillion to $5.2 trillion. I was just wondering what drove that? Mike Bell : Nothing, specific Brian. It's really the negative impact of markets that's the big driver there. Brian Bedell : On the pension side okay. The 6% drop linked quarter, was it all market related? Mike Bell : I wouldn't say all market related. I don't have that desegregation right at my finger tips. But the main drop in the AUA was in fact from markets. Jay Hooley : Nothing going on from a loss business standpoint. Brian Bedell : Okay. That's what I was getting at. Yes. Okay, great. And thanks for that. And then just tax rate guidance, this would imply that would be towards the higher end for the next three quarters given it was 29% for 1Q. Is that fair? Mike Bell : Yes. I think that's fair Brian. First of all, the operating tax rate that we provide is heavily impacted by tax advantaged investments. And so just based on the seasonal pattern of tax advantage investments, we tend to see the pattern that you're describing. So nothing particularly surprising there and we experienced a similar pattern in 2015. Brian Bedell : Got it. And just as lastly the -- you talked about the Futures Clearing business, but the impact of the Reuters business, was doing that two times in Reuters and is that suppose to the FX trading line or is that in a different line from the revenue side? Mike Bell : That's in the -- let's say it's in the other -- it's in the fees line item in brokerage and other fees line item. Brian Bedell : Okay. Is that -- can you size that just for modeling? Mike Bell : I don't have that rate at my finger tips. It's relatively small. We can follow-up with you offline on that one Brian. Brian Bedell : Yes. Perfect. Thank you. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. And that was our final question. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Therese, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking with everybody at the end of the second quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference. Thank you for your participation. That does conclude the conference. You may now disconnect.",

As such, we expect to hold our third quarter earnings call on Wednesday, October 26, 2016. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our strong second quarter results which reflect strong fee growth compared to the first quarter driven by growth in our core asset servicing and asset management fees and the seasonal uptick in securities finance. Demand remains strong across our global client base as demonstrated by new servicing commitments of $750 billion in the quarter. Importantly, these results also reflect our success in implementing our multi-year digital transformation program, State Street Beacon, which is delivering savings and efficiencies as well as new product innovations for our clients. As you may have seen in the news today, we announced that we have negotiated a series of agreements subject to final approval that we expect to resolve all pending litigation and regulatory matters in the U.S. related to our indirect foreign exchange business. We're pleased to put this litigation behind us. Matters of this nature can drain both time and resources, so where possible and appropriate we feel it is in our and our clients' interest to pursue settlements. Our previously established reserve will be sufficient to cover all the cost associated with these agreements. I'd now like to turn your attention to slide five of our slide deck, as I want to highlight for you a number of developments this quarter that helped us make substantive progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. In support of our objective to become a digital leader in financial services we advanced a number of State Street Beacon initiatives. In the first half of 2016 we successfully digitized a significant portion of platforms that enable straight through processing of client transactions end-to-end. Some of the early successes here include faster cycle times, with end-of-day net asset values being delivered 20 to 30 minutes earlier and reduction of manual transactions. Our fund administration digitization prototype is underway and expected to be rolled out to clients in the early fall. Our focus on driving growth from the core franchise resulted in asset servicing wins of approximately $750 billion in the quarter. This included the appointment of \u2013 by Deka Bank and Allianz Global Investors to provide a range of investment services for $538 billion in assets and the appointment as custodian and outsourcing partner for Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Company's Japanese investment trust business. Our new business yet to be installed now stands at over $1 trillion. We experienced outflows of $35 billion during the quarter in our asset management business driven mostly by passive equities and reflective of official institution clients redirecting assets in response to economic conditions. Importantly these outflows are primarily in our low fee-based institutional products. We continue to generate new business in our higher yielding product lines such as GLD, which is our gold ETF, active equity, multi-asset and institutional. For example, in the second quarter we launched 15 new ETFs at an average total expense ratio of 37 basis points. This is reflected in our favorable management fee revenues for the second quarter of 2016 and our outlook for management fee revenue growth remains positive for the second half of the year. We continue to invest in support of our overall strategy and earlier this month on July 1 we successfully completed our acquisition of GE Asset Management. This transaction is a key step in our plan to invest in higher growth return businesses. It's also an important part of SSGA's continued evolution as a premier provider of solutions to clients. GE Asset Management has significant asset management capabilities including active management, alternative and outsourced Chief Investment Officer capabilities. With our focus on expense management we have reduced expenses both on a year-over-year and year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule. In fact, we're now expected to generate at least $140 million in annualized pre-tax expense savings in 2016. We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. During the second quarter of 2016, we executed the final phase of our common stock purchase program announced in March 2015. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve's 2016 CCAR process. Our 2016 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 12% in our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share, starting in the third quarter of 2016 subject to Board of Directors approval. We'll continue to focus our attention and effort in 2016 on our strategic priorities. We expect this will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. Moving to slide number six, I'd like to discuss the opportunities presented in Europe and our strong franchise there. Despite the Brexit vote and the remaining uncertainty, Europe and the UK represent a significant opportunity for us. For instance, Europe is 35% of the world's assets under management and is expected to grow by approximately 30% by 2020. Slow GDP growth and a weak economic outlook reinforce high savings rates while lower interest rates are driving a search for yield that pushes funds out of deposits into other investments such as mutual funds and cross-border investments. In addition to Brexit, other trends that we're seeing are that regulatory changes and cost pressures are creating client demand for complex outsourcing services. We have a deep and diversified presence in Europe, as we have nearly 11,000 employees in 12 European countries. 20% of those employees are in the UK with the majority being situated in nine European countries under our recently consolidated international bank which is based in Germany. Given this presence we have an organizational structure that gives us the potential to offer both passportable EU products and services tailored to European markets. We're well-positioned to support our clients and gain new clients regardless of the jurisdiction. We are the leader in offshore servicing and grew our offshore assets under administration by 70% over the last three years while growing market share. We provide support of the global fund distribution of regulated products called UCITS in more than 70 countries worldwide. Similarly, we're the industry leader in ETF servicing with over 60% European ETF assets under administration market share. Not including the impact of lower market interest rates, our short and long term outlook for our European business has not materially changed post the EU referendum vote. We believe the post EU referendum vote winners will be the firms with strength in offshore, in the UK and in pan-European fund structures, and an on-the-ground presence in key domestic markets, and demonstrated ability to partner with clients to navigate complexity. We believe State Street is well-positioned in these areas to take advantage of the short and long term growth opportunities in Europe and the U.K. Now let me turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the second quarter and then we'll turn to your questions. Mike? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Jay and good morning, everyone. This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I would like to note that our GAAP basis results for the second quarter include two notable items. First on April 1, 2016 we sold the WM/Reuters branded foreign exchange benchmark business to Thomson Reuters resulting in a pre-tax gain of approximately $53 million. Second, we recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $58 million that reflects an increase in our reserve related to our previously disclosed review of amounts we invoice clients for certain expenses. Now refer to slide seven in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 2Q 2016, and for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which I'll refer to as year-to-date. By way of summary, 2Q 2016 results were driven by both strong sequential fee revenue growth and expense management. Operating basis EPS for 2Q 2016 increased to $1.46 per share from $1.36 in 2Q 2015 and increased from 1Q 2016, which included the impact from seasonality associated with retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Year-to-date EPS decreased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in year-to-date fee revenue primarily due to lower equity markets as well as lower net interest revenue, partially offset by share repurchases and lower expenses. Importantly, 2Q 2016 total expenses decreased compared to the year ago quarter, resulting in an expansion in pre-tax margin to 31.5% in 2Q 2016. The first half of 2016 operating basis effective tax rate of 27.9% is lower than our current expectation for the full year 2016 of 30% to 32% primarily due to the timing of our tax advantaged investments. Regarding capital, in 2Q 2016 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.34 a share and purchased $390 million of our common stock. Moving to slide nine, I want to highlight the strong positive fee operating leverage in 2Q 2016 compared to the year ago quarter. Strong progress in 2Q 2016, particularly on the expense front, positions us to continue to expect operating basis fee revenue growth to outpace operating basis expense growth for full year 2016 relative to 2015 under current conditions and excluding the GE Asset Management acquisition. I'll now turn to slide 11 for a review of our 2Q 2016 operating basis revenues. Servicing fees decreased from the year ago quarter, primarily due to lower equity markets, and increased relative to 1Q 2016, due to net new business and higher global equity markets. Compared to the year ago quarter, the decrease in international equity markets, particularly in emerging markets, negatively impacted servicing fees. Average daily values for the MSCI Emerging Market Index decreased 19%, while the EAFE Equity Index was down approximately 14% relative to a year ago. Management fees decreased relative to a year ago, also reflecting lower equity markets. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 2Q 2015, due to lower volumes. Securities finance revenue was up slightly from 2Q 2015, primarily reflecting continued growth in enhanced custody, mostly offset by a lower seasonal benefit compared to the year ago quarter. Moving now to slide 12, I would note that our operating basis net interest revenue has benefited from a higher Fed Funds rate at the end of 4Q 2015, as well as disciplined liability pricing. Net interest revenue decreased from 2Q 2015, primarily driven by the reduction in size of our balance sheet, partially offset by liability pricing discipline. Now let's turn to slide 13 to review 2Q 2016 operating basis expenses. Importantly, total operating basis expenses were well-controlled in 2Q 2016, decreasing approximately 3% from 2Q 2015. 2Q 2016 expenses were nearly flat with 1Q 2016 when excluding the 1Q 2016 seasonal deferred compensation expense of $122 million for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes. Compared to 2Q 2015, compensation and employee benefit expenses increased modestly, primarily due to increased costs to support regulatory initiatives and net new business, mostly offset by State Street Beacon savings. Importantly, other expenses decreased from 2Q 2015, driven by a significant reduction in professional services cost. We now move to slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remain strong, which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to March 31, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully-phased in standardized approach, primarily driven by an increase in risk-weighted assets, generated by the FX volatility late in the quarter following the Brexit vote. The June 30 fully-phased in supplementary leverage ratio at the Corp increased to 6.1%, and the bank increased to 6.3%, primarily due to the preferred stock issuance in the second quarter. Please note that the capital impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management will be reflected in our third quarter 2016 capital ratios, and our estimate of this impact is noted on slide 16. We repurchased $390 million of common stock in 2Q 2016, under our prior common stock purchase program, announced in March of 2015. And importantly, our capital actions included in our 2016 CCAR capital plan demonstrated our focus to return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Moving on now to the next slide, let me briefly discuss our acquisition of GE Asset Management. The acquisition of GE Asset Management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. The purchase price was $435 million, subject to adjustments, with up to $50 million tied to incremental opportunities with GE. Excluding merger and integration cost, the transaction is expected to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the first full 12-month period as of July 1, 2016. Moving to slide 17, I'll now provide an update to our 2016 financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to our 2016 outlook exclude any potential impact from the acquisition of GE Asset Management. Relative to the first quarter, second quarter results reflected strong fee revenue growth and well-controlled expenses. Importantly, we continue to target positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015, assuming current market conditions. Included in our expectation, to generate positive fee operating leverage is modest operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015. Importantly, on the expense front, we now expect operating basis expenses to be approximately flat for full year 2016 relative to full year 2015. Included in our expectation of flat operating basis expenses for full year 2016 is upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs and expenses related to the installation of new business for the second half of 2016. Contributing to the success in managing expenses has been the execution of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. We now expect State Street Beacon to deliver at least $140 million in estimated annual pre-tax fiscal savings in 2016. Moving on to net interest revenue, for full year 2016 we currently expect operating basis NIR to modestly exceed the high end of our static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. This assumes U.S. interest rates remain static and some additional central bank easing occurs outside the U.S. So in summary, we're very pleased with the 2Q 2016 results, as sequential quarterly growth in fee revenue and strong expense control positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives. Now let me turn the call over to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Mike. And Jennifer, we're now available to open the call to questions. Operator : Your first question will come from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning, Jay and Mike. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Jay, I was just hoping you could share what the client reception has been so far to the digitization program and then, as you maybe look out a year or two, what do you think you will be able to do with this program in terms of servicing clients versus where you are today? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Appreciate the question, Ashley. The Beacon effort as you know, is designed to improve straight-through processing, so clean up a lot of the handoffs and the inefficiencies. But importantly, when you do that, the impact it has on clients can be pretty dramatic. So one of the examples that I referenced in my prepared remarks, I just push out a little bit. One of the things that we do in huge volume is, at the end of the day produce a net asset value based on the workings of the day in the daily fund business where we have a pretty significant position globally, and the production of that net asset value is critical from a timing standpoint, and once you get that, that feeds downstream distribution systems, it feeds newspapers and other communication vehicles. We have seen through the most recent improvements in Beacon that we've been able to pull back that time of producing a net asset value 20 minutes to 30 minutes, which on an hour and a half window is significant. So our clients, who are ultimately concerned about satisfying their distribution systems, when we can deliver that 30 minutes early it gives everybody in the chain more time to react. It might seem mundane but to our clients it's a huge win. I'd say secondly, we experienced in the first quarter a 20% reduction in the number of reconciliations that we do within the company. And again, that just improves not only cost but accuracy and how data flows back to our clients. I think to your question ultimately, our vision or end game in this is not only to achieve the savings that are prescribed by Beacon but to the extent that we can digitize our internal environment and make it real-time to our clients, the ability to get information intraday, whether it's cash positions, whether it's risk management data, that's really where we're going with this and when we established Global Exchange a few years ago, that was done in order to take the benefit digitizing our internal production environment and start to provide information and analytic services to our clients, not just back office, but middle and front office as well. And in parallel, Global Exchange is introducing some exciting new products that give clients intraday access and insights to what's going on in their portfolio, all enabled by our ability through Beacon to digitize our internal environment. So, you've heard me say before, to me it is the next big thing in this business and we're making good progress. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you for all the color there. And maybe a question for Mike as well. Appreciate the NII guidance, but can you just walk through your thoughts on what your liability pricing initiatives are likely to do to the balance sheet and just anything we should be mindful of in terms of accelerated refis and impact on NIM? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Ashley. So first of all, I'd say from a liability pricing standpoint, we're really pleased with the success that we've had for the first six months of 2016. And at this point, I anticipate that that would continue into the second half of 2016. Specifically, we did increase the amount that we're charging for deposits, for example, in Europe when the ECB cut rates further in March. Obviously it's anybody's guess where the ECB will go from here, so it's a situation that we're watching carefully. But I would anticipate that we would look to move \u2013 at least in the near term, I would expect that we would move in lock-step with further changes with the ECB. So it's a situation that we're monitoring but I don't expect any change at this point from the pattern that we had good success with in the first half of the year. So as a result, I would expect that overall, the deposit levels that we saw in Q2 are likely to remain probably pretty close to that level over the remainder of the year. But again, it's a situation that's pretty fluid and one that we're watching pretty carefully. Ashley Neil Serrao - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you for the color and congrats on the quarter. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks, good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could follow-up on your comments about the expenses. The Other line again, $255 million or so, really great control and a meaningful decline year-over-year. You mentioned professional services fees, but I guess I'd just ask you to walk us through, like is this a new run rate, are a lot of your professional services fees that you've kind of had to spend on in the past done and kind of the moving parts within your expense outlook, you mentioned some of the investments but I think that's the real delta into peoples' expectations thanks. Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thanks, Ken. First of all, I appreciate the positive commentary on Q2 and I think those comments are well-deserved. I think, start off broadly and then go to your specific question. We feel really good, Ken, about the job that we've done managing expenses in the first half of 2016 and primarily I would focus on two areas that we've talked about previously. The first, as you accurately pointed out, we have done a good job at replacing a significant amount of the outside consulting expend with full time employees. And that's a real good trade economically, and we also expect that that will build a more sustainable infrastructure going forward. So we're real pleased around that. Second, we're obviously real pleased with our success to-date here around project Beacon and as I alluded to in my comments, we were able to accelerate some of the savings for 2016 around project Beacon, specifically, we moved faster on management spans and layers than we had previously planned. We also captured more of the savings through the increase in straight-through processing that Jay described. So I think we've done a good job on all those fronts for the first half of the year. There are some specific areas that we expect upward pressure on expenses in the second half of the year, and there are three specifically, Ken, that I would highlight here. The first is, we're \u2013 we have known new business in the global servicing business and we will obviously staff to service that new business. And that includes for example, the Allianz business that we've talked about publicly. So that would be an example. Now, specifically tying that to your Other operating expense question, we will actually have some expenses in the Other operating expense category because part of that arrangement includes a transition services agreement. It's basically a lift-out deal and so we have some transition service expenses that will show up in the second half of the year in Other operating expenses related to that particular piece of new business. So that's one. Second, while I really feel good about what we've done in terms of managing regulatory spending, we are going to see some upward pressure in the second half of the year around regulatory spending, particularly as it relates to the recovery and resolution planning that's gotten so much press here. There's an October 1 deliverable that we're very focused on. There's also a July 1, 2017 deliverable that we're very focused on and that will inevitably push up the level of regulatory spend in the second half of the year. And then just for completeness, I would add that while we accelerated some Beacon savings into the second quarter, I do expect that we'll accelerate some Beacon investments in the second half of the year. So from a net-net standpoint, I would expect Beacon to entail additional spending in the second half of the year as compared to the second quarter run rate. Now, all of that needs to be thought about, Ken, in the context of positive fee operating leverage for the full year. We are absolutely as a management team riveted on achieving that for the full year. So for example, if the fee revenue environment looked softer than it is right now, we'd have to look even harder at expenses in the second half of the year. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great color, Mike. And just to follow-up, two of the legacy issues that you spoke to in the press release, the FX seems like that's now behind and also does this client billing true-up, on a GAAP basis, does that put that issue behind now as well? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So first of all on the FX piece, it does resolve the U.S. litigation that we have. And we continue to expect that the overall accrual that we have set up, which is $585 million, will be sufficient for all known issues. But again, it was the U.S. piece in particular that we feel real pleased putting behind us with this announcement. On the billing piece, Ken, the main point that I would make there is that at this point, we've completed our calculations at the client level. And I cannot emphasize enough that was just an extraordinary amount of detail going back, invoices over 18 years, literally millions of invoices at the client level. And our previous calculation had been in aggregate. So this refinement caused the update to the accrual. And I mean at this point, we're confident in the calculations we've done at the client level. But we're now \u2013 the next step is really now underway as we speak, which is we're now reviewing this detail with the impacted clients. And that's really the next step ahead of us and again, in putting this prior-year issue behind us. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Thanks for color, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Maybe just a quick question on the living will, one of your peers discussed that changing to a single point of entry could increase expenses and higher long term debt costs. Is that a similar issue for you or how should we think about that for you guys? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Jim, this is Jay. That's not a similar issue for us. We have pursued a single point of entry strategy from the beginning and continue to pursue that. So for us, it's more about absorbing the input from the Fed and the FDIC and marching to it. As Mike mentioned, the October date, and importantly, there's even more work to be done for the July, 2017 date but we have a pretty clear mandate for what we need to do and it's a matter of executing against that. So, no big shifts in strategy with regard to resolution. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's really helpful. And then when we think about \u2013 the second question on the Deka Bank onboarding, it sounds like that's happening reasonably quickly. Is that the right conclusion? And when we look at the impact on expenses is that half of the growth? How do we think about the impact on your guidance of flat when you're tracking down in the first half? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Let me start that one, Jim, and just give you a little bit more color on the Deka and Allianz Global Investors business. It's a large transaction as you could probably figure out from the size of the assets that we'll be servicing. One major component of it, which will be enabled beginning in the third quarter, is a large fund accounting operation, which spans Germany and Luxembourg, which adds to our Luxembourg leadership position, and creates a leadership position for us in Germany, which we think is a key marketplace. So we will take it over beginning of the third quarter. Revenues and expenses will go with that. As Mike mentioned, not unusual for a deal like this. Initially, we'll take it over intact as a transition agreement, and then we'll evolve it to our systems, and that will happen towards the end of the year. So that's a little bit of color on Deka and Allianz Global Investors. And, Mike, proportionality to the expenses? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. Jim, It's Mike. So, I'd really prefer not to get into specific numbers around client-specific arrangements, but I think it's fair to say, Jim, that it's part of the overall upward pressure that I mentioned in my prepared remarks around operating expenses for the second half of the year, relative to Q2. Some of it is to support net new business, including the Deka Allianz win. Second would include the upward pressure, given what we need to do around RRP. And then, third is the additional Beacon investments. I'd rather not get into more detail. But I think it's fair to say, on the net new business, that we expect that to help fee revenue for the second half of the year, as well as be an area that we spend some money to service. So that's all thought of as we gave you the updated outlook for full year 2016. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, right. So it sounds like the revenue is coming in coincidental with the expenses. So that's great. Thanks. Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Correct. Operator : Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of cleanup questions again around expenses. So the $140 million of Beacon savings this year relative to I guess, $100 million that you guys talked about in the past, is that just simply the faction (35:21) of timing or the size? In other words, did this take away from some of the savings we should think about for next year or the size of the ultimate savings got \u2013 was increased in your view? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So Alex, its Mike. At this point, we're still maintaining the $550 million net savings target for the full program. So I would suggest that you think about this as accelerating it into 2016. Now, I would note that we have not changed our outlook for 2017, so we still expect that increment to remain intact. So, therefore, you could deduce it's the savings in the out-years that are being brought up, some brought into 2017 and then some of the 2017 and beyond into 2016. Particularly around the areas that I mentioned, the improvement in the straight-through processing and the reduction in management spans and layers. Again, this will be a program, Alex, that I suspect we'll continue to give you updates over the next several years. So, stay tuned. The main point I'd reinforce is, really are doing a nice job in terms of executing on this program, and I would expect that to continue. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got you. And then a quick follow-up around the GE deal, and how we should think about it in near term, as well as longer term. So, I think you gave us the dollars in terms of revenue, so I was wondering if you could give us the expenses for the back half of the year that's going to come in with this deal. And then I guess, more importantly, as we think about this business phasing into State Street, what are the cost savings that you expect to realize from integrating it? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Alex. Let me first reinforce the numbers that we talked about in the slide presentation. So, overall, for the first 12 months of the arrangement, so July 1, 2016 through June 30 of 2017, we expect the overall revenue contribution to be in the range of $270 million to $300 million. And while we haven't given you the specific expenses associated with it, given that we indicated that we expect this to be accretive in terms of overall EPS, and you can also look at the cost of the prefs that we issued in second quarter to essentially fund it, you can get a pretty good estimate of the first 12-month financial expectations for the overall arrangement. In terms of the Q3 contribution, we expect that the revenue for Q3 will be approximately $60 million, and we expect the contribution to pre-tax earnings, if we exclude the merger and integration cost, to be a modest positive. So think of it as something in the less than $5 million contribution here for Q3. So, in terms of where we go from Q3 to the following three quarters, I would note that we expect the expense synergies to really begin to materialize in Q4 and then ramp up further in Q1 and Q2 of 2017. And then, from a revenue perspective, we do expect to grow that $60 million in third quarter to something higher than that number in the first and second quarters of 2017, which is what gets you from a, call it a $240 million annualized number, in Q3, to something in the $270 million to $300 million range for the first full 12 months. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And this $5 million number, that's net of the pref cost? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, no. That's truly just the contribution of the business organization itself, and it's actually a little less than $5 million. So think of it as a modest contribution. But again, importantly, we are highly confident in our ability to get synergies through the combination of this organization, which is really terrific. I mean, 270 terrific employees, a little over 100 institutional clients, a fair number of them are actually overlapped with State Street's client base in the past. So, again, we're really jazzed up about the synergies here. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And Alex, just a footnote. We had set a 90% client retention rate. We achieved 95%, which was not shocking, but positive given what our expectations were. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, yeah. Understood. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning, folks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Mike, thanks for all the expense detail. That's real helpful. Maybe, is it possible to talk a little bit about the trajectory of the Beacon saves? The $140 million, maybe if you can talk about the exit run rate in fourth quarter, or actually, the actual fourth quarter run rate of savings. And then as we go into 2017 for the $125 million, how you see that running through 2017. And then, I know it's early, but, essentially, it sounds like you're pulling some of the expense saves in from the outer years, so should we expect this project to be completed potentially by 2020? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, let's see, a number of questions there, Brian. First of all, let me give you an important data point here. On a year-to-date basis, our Beacon saves for year-to-date 2016, relative to the same year-to-date period in 2015, was approximately $75 million. So, essentially, I mean, if you doubled that, you'd get to $150 million. And, basically, that syncs up with the point that I was making, that we expect now the full-year savings to be approximately $140 million for full-year 2016, versus full-year 2015 starting point. So you can conclude from that arithmetic that we expect some additional net spending on Beacon as we invest in particularly some IT areas in the second half of the year, as compared to the quarter two expense base. So, from a run rate standpoint, I think you can think of it as we'll be leaving full year 2016 at something pretty close to our current expenses. And again, a little bit higher net Beacon spending pushing that. So the savings number for the full year being a little bit less than what you'd get if you doubled the year-to-date savings number. Again, in terms of 2017, I'm sure we'll provide additional updates between now and the beginning of 2017. I think the main point is that we still expect the 2017 savings to be on top of the $140 million of savings that we expect to achieve in full year 2016. So, it should give you confidence that the pace here is actually accelerated. And I wouldn't, at this point, try to either change the $550 million full program target, or to change the end date. But, again, it's something that I'm sure we'll continue to give you updates on in the future. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe to follow-up, on the net interest revenue outlook, can you just talk about what you're assuming there for the long \u2013 let's say for the 10-year Treasury yield, and whether you think there is any potential for raising any long term debt in conjunction with the resolution planning? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. So, Brian, in terms of the net interest revenue, I believe, if my recollection is right this morning, I think the 10-year is at about 1.55%. And so, what we've assumed in the updated NIR forecast that we gave you is static rates in the U.S., and then, likely some easing by the Bank of England, probably in August. And so, it's really the combination of the grind in the portfolio, as the existing portfolio rolls over and gets reinvested at lower rates, coupled with this likely easing in the UK, are obviously factors that are putting some negative pressure on the second half of the year net interest revenue. As it relates \u2013 actually, one other data point, before I forget it, in the Q2, we did note on slide 12 of the slide deck that we did have \u2013 it was actually four discrete securities prepay. So it was unscheduled redemptions in Q2. That contributed $5 million of positive NIR in Q2. We don't expect that to repeat in Q3 and Q4. So if you're really \u2013 if you're doing the modeling, I would suggest you sort of start with a $541 million rather than a $546 million. Again, just, it will help the modeling make more sense. Your last question around the debt. I don't expect at this point to have to issue additional long term debt just because of the RRP. Again, we're working on a longer term capital plan that does ultimately include compliance with the proposed TLAC requirements. Now, again, TLAC, at this point, is a proposal, not a final rule. But as it relates specifically to your point around RRP, I don't anticipate having to issue long term debt just because of RRP. But again, the whole RRP situation is a pretty fluid one, as you can imagine. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Okay, that's helpful. I'll get back in the queue for a couple of follow-ups. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you and good morning, I wanted to ask about the positive mix shift in asset management fees. And, obviously, there have been some outflows and some other factors that State Street doesn't necessarily control. But wanted to get your thoughts on the strategy there. You noted that you're introducing a suite of products that have pretty good fees associated with them. How much can you kind of target a positive mix shift, and how do you go about doing that with your products and your clients? And should we expect a run rate on that, or perhaps even more leverage? Thank you. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, thanks. Let me pick that one up. So first point is that, in the quarter, we had $35 billion of outflows, mostly passive equities and separate accounts and not ETFs. And I would say the other theme, which I referenced, is sovereign wealth funds, mostly oil-based sovereign wealth funds, looking to reallocate. We have been focused for some time on introducing new products that have higher yields to them from a standpoint of the fees and, more particularly, the management fees, and we've had good success with that. I referenced some of the new ETFs we brought out. That's a continuation on a theme. I'd also add that GLD, the gold fund, is probably more of a product for the times. But we've had great traction in our active quant equity products, which are doing nice from a performance standpoint, and therefore, the flows are coming in nicely, high-fee products, from our standpoint, the multi-asset class. And so, I would say it's been a conscious effort for the last, I would say, 18 months to 24 months, to focus on those higher-fee products. And I think we're making headway. If you look at the first quarter and the management fee growth of almost 5%, some of that's market, but some of it is a reflection of the mix shift. And as we sit mid-year looking towards rest of year, we expect to continue to see growth in the asset management business. Mostly based on introducing higher yielding products and getting positive flows into those products. I think that the commoditized end of our world tends to move with markets and other events. As you know, we have the largest ETF in SPY, the S&P 500, which trades pretty actively. But our strategy consciously is to move to the higher end of the product spectrum. Last point I would make, Adam, is that the GE Asset Management business is a really big add in supporting that strategy. And that not only do we think we have a great opportunity to compete in the outsourced CIO marketplace, given what GE brings, but GE brings a mix of more active products, high fee products that can be sold as standalone. But even more importantly, as part of a bundled mix to provide solutions, whether it's in a 401(k) setting, outsourced CIO, or other elements of the risk spectrum. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, Jay. I really appreciate that. That's great color. Also wanted to ask about the slide on Europe and the opportunities there, which was interesting so soon post-Brexit. And thinking about the competition there, both sort of U.S. domiciled and European domiciled, what would you say are the one or two biggest advantages that State Street has versus the competition, and maybe one or two of the bigger challenges? Thanks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Let me pick that up, Adam. I think my Brexit-related comments, the only caveat I would make is that to the extent that Brexit and the EU bring down global growth or broad-based interest rates, that's outside of this commentary. But if you look at Brexit and our European strategy, we have a different business. So our business is driven by asset pools. Both pension, insurance and investment asset pools. So, if you think about managing and servicing assets, that's the starting point. We've seen, in the last couple years, as the Eurozone has had increasing economic pressure, savings rates go up. Savings rates continue to be pretty high in countries like Germany, Italy, France, and those products increasingly are not only growing, the asset pools are growing, but the assets are moving out of banks into investment products. So the environment there is quite good generally. Enter Brexit. Tremendous uncertainty about what Brexit means and how the UK will ultimately disentangle from the EU, and I'm sure it will take a long time for that to unwind. But from my standpoint, if you look at it through investment products, there are several structures that exist in Europe. And importantly, in Europe, as opposed to the U.S., which is one homogeneous market, Europe, you've got 20 different markets. And so, the notion of passporting or creating product in one domicile and being able to sell it across the Eurozone, is critical to success for an asset manager in Europe. And so it's likely, and there are some product structures, Oeics, SICAVs, UCIT. Oeics, for example, are created in the UK and they're passportable to the Eurozone. To the extent that the break between the UK and the Eurozone results in folks having to transition Oeics to things like SICAVs, then we're there to do that. We're the largest provider of these services across 11 different markets. Significantly, I think the big winners will be the offshore centers. Luxembourg and probably, more importantly, Ireland, who have been the winners in the last couple years with regard to flows. So that's kind of the landscape. That's why we view the Brexit event to be neutral, if not positive, given that we have the most comprehensive set of services across the most markets in Europe. From a competitive standpoint, when we acquired Deutsche Bank's business some years ago, it really catapulted us into leading positions in Germany, Ireland, the Intesa Sanpaolo deal gave us a leading presence in Italy. We've always been in the UK. We've built out our Luxembourg presence. So there's nobody near us with regard to servicing investment products, with the most geography covered across the most asset classes. I would say, secondarily, that the U.S. firms probably are more competent in the offshore centers of Lux and Dublin than the European providers would be. There's a couple of European providers that can provide Pan-European servicing, but pretty limited. So I would say we are at the top of that pyramid. Some of our U.S. competitors have component parts of the European puzzle, but nobody has as comprehensive a servicing capability as we do in Europe. Hence, the enthusiasm. Adam Q. Beatty - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very nice. Thank you. Look forward to updates in the future. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just one quick one on revenue here first. So, it looked like your servicing fee rate ticked up here this quarter. I know you guys commented on new business wins. So, is it right to assume that that rate and that sort of fee level would be sustainable and it's just a mix shift given some of the wins that are there this quarter? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Brennan, it's Mike, as we've talked about before, there are a number of things that can impact that calculation that you described. So I would \u2013 and actually in particular, the net new business has been positive here for a while. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we expect net new business to add to overall GS fees in the second half of the year relative to the Q2 run rate. But I wouldn't \u2013 again, please remember that only approximately 60% of the GS fee revenue is driven on basis points on assets. So, swings in the market, for example, can play havoc with the ratio that you're referencing. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, I get it, but it's the only way we basically have to model your revenue. So that's what we're left to do in the valley of the blind. But anyway, that's fine. I appreciate the commentary. And then one more clarification point also on the expense front. Seems like you had indicated some upward regulatory spend in your comments, Mike, and so was just curious about how that was going to manifest itself in the P&L. It seemed like you all had gotten some success in shifting some of that professional services spend up to comp. And so, are you saying that we might see a little bit of an uplift from the 2Q levels in professional services or is that rather going to come through on the comp line? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Brennan, First, I appreciate the compliment and we have had good success making that change that you described. I do expect that there will be a little bit of upward pressure on the comp and employee benefit line from the regulatory expenses but I think the majority will likely show up in other operating expenses, particularly given the very tight time frames that we're dealing with around the resolution and recovery planning in particular. I mean the October 1 deadline is very real, obviously, rapidly approaching, and as Jay indicated, the July 1, 2017 one is very meaningful as well. So for both of those reasons, I would expect that outside consulting expense will increase in Q3 and Q4. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Sure, but that would probably then just follow the same pattern that you all were able to execute in \u2013 over the longer term once you get past the near term deadlines, shifting that into a sort of lower priced but comp-oriented mix down the road is that a reasonable assumption? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's a very fair assumption, Brennan. Absolutely. Brennan McHugh Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks for taking my questions. Jay and Mike, I had a bigger question if you kind of back up a little bit. This quarter feels like one of the things we've been looking for is an inflection point in some processes and pressures that you've been kind of working your way through. Mike, I got two for you and I got two for Jay. When you look at, Mike, the efficiency, you've been investing in the efficiency, how far along do you feel like we are? Are we getting to that point where the benefits are going to outweigh the investments? And then also on the balance sheet restructure, we've been in that for a couple of years which really started with the liquidity coverage ratio and capital requirements. Have we kind of come through that because we're starting to see NIR starting to grow again. So have we kind of gone through the inflection point on those two things? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Marty. Let me take both of those. First, from an efficiency standpoint, sure, I feel very positive that in the first half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2015, project Beacon generated $75 million of net savings. Now, we invested in there, but the point is, it contributed $75 million of net savings. And so I \u2013 yeah, I do believe that project Beacon has already shown that it's accretive in the near term. In addition, I would point to the success \u2013 as we've talked about with several of the other analysts, the success we've had in moving the regulatory expense to lesser expensive full-time employees rather than expensive outside consultants. I think that's also an important inflection point that has helped us. Now it doesn't mean that there isn't upward pressure on regulatory expense, particularly around RRP. But I do think that we've shown that we are executing on the plan that we had previously communicated which is to make that shift which ultimately saves us money. On the balance sheet restructuring, I do feel positive about where the balance sheet is positioned. I mean, I don't think we have to look any further than the results of the last CCAR that are now public to note that our mark-to-market sensitivity under the severely adverse scenario is quite a bit better than what it had done previously. And so that was an important step forward for us from a balance sheet restructuring. At this point, we're fully compliant with the LCR rules. So, yeah, I feel good about all of that. Now again, the one area that hasn't hit an inflection point yet is really market interest rates. I mean, maybe the Fed will increase again in the reasonable near future. But the \u2013 outside of the U.S., it's still been moving in a negative position. So that's the area that I would say we haven't yet hit the inflection point but I'd like to believe at least in the U.S., maybe that could come sooner rather than later. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Then, Jay, when we look at the ability to take the cloud, we've invested in since building out the new resources and information, we're talking about those new products, you seem more confident in that but as we're talking about that in terms of generate some revenues from those newer services that we're going to get from the data out of the cloud. And then also, you are guiding a transition from building out your ETFs to really now putting in GE and becoming more active management, higher fees, so is that transition starting to kind of go through an inflection point that you can start to see some build-out? And then, Jay, just overall, State Street's gone through periods in the past where you've had to go through these transitions. It set the stage for very good performance after you went through these inflection points. Just if you would kind of comment on how your thoughts would be compared to past inflection points that we've seen. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Happy to do that, Marty. Yeah, I do think this is an inflection point. I think you started out with a cloud and Beacon and that is critically important from a standpoint of managing cost in a difficult environment, but even more important relative to continuing to differentiate our services, vis-a-vis the competitors and the interest of what clients are looking for today. So the first point I would make is that some of our successes in the marketplace are not only a reflection of us producing better capabilities, better products, information-based services, but it's also a reflection of the pressure that our clients are feeling in a low return environment to outsource more work. So I would put that in the inflection point transition bucket too. I don't see that slowing down anytime soon, so whether it's a mutual fund manager moving to outsource middle office or in the alternatives world moving from hedge, now private equity and real estate, there's a surge to outsource those things. So I think it's a convergence of more outsourcing driven by the environment and our client base based on our continued ability to differentiate our product sets and compete effectively at good pricing to win new business. I think that's a trend that we're likely to continue to see and the cloud and Beacon is right at the center of that because this business trades more and more on the ability to provide analytics and information and insight from the processing work that we do, and that's going to continue. The other thing I could add is the regulatory pressure on our clients again is forcing both of those things to happen. I think similarly in the world of asset management, we have been on a journey the last couple of years, to transition, I wouldn't say completely pivot, but transition our business to maintaining those core products that we have but building out our ETF distribution capabilities in the U.S. and Europe, investing in higher-yielding products. I think the GE acquisition potentially is an inflection point for us. In the world of solutions, which is a huge opportunity for everybody in asset management, you need to have enough asset classes and competencies to be able to mix them together to create outcomes, and GE just provides an enormous new set of capabilities for us to compete more effectively in that world. And so, I would say it's ETFs, it's not necessarily single asset class products that we'll deliver to the marketplace, but this notion of solutions is going to continue to be a key theme in the asset management world, and I think we're well positioned and the GE transaction just puts us over the top with regard to capabilities that we can leverage across our global institutional distribution system to continue to grow. So I do feel like we're passing through a period here where we're getting our costs better aligned for the realities of today. We're moving digitally which is where the future is going to be with regard to the clients' needs, and I'd say asset management is going through a similar transition. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I had a question on the NIM, you were able to keep that essentially flat Q on Q, and while yields came down a bit, cost of funds came down more. I'm just wondering on the cost of funds side, you had some nice decline in the non-U.S. transaction accounts and I know you've been charging depositors non-operating charges. But I'm wondering what happened in the quarter that enabled a pretty big step down in the non-U.S. transaction accounts? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Betsy. It's Mike. Two items that would I highlight around that line item on our average rates earned and paid page. Two points impacted that favorably for the quarter. First of all, as you correctly pointed out, we did increase the amount of what we're charging for deposits at a greater pace than the cut, for example, in the ECB rate. So that helped that line item in particular, Q2 versus Q1, the greater amount that we were charging for European deposits in particular. Second though, it's a little bit of a funny nuance. We do have in any given quarter decisions to make around whether we swap the non-U.S. deposits into U.S. dollars and put them with the Fed or whether in fact we leave them outside the U.S. at central banks abroad. In particular, for a variety of technical reasons, we swapped less to U.S. dollars in Q2 than we had in Q1. And so what that meant was, the FX swap costs that we normally run through that line, that was a \u2013 there was a smaller charge for that in Q2 versus Q1. So it had a similar impact on the asset side as it did on the liability side, so no net impact to the NIM. And in fact you can see the decline in the interest bearing deposits with banks line item that is essentially the partial offset to that. But from an economic standpoint, the piece that I would focus on is the more disciplined liability pricing, particularly outside the U.S. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, and is there more room for that to run from here? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, obviously it's a situation that we're monitoring very carefully. At this point, I don't expect that we would see even greater daylight for example in EMEA between what we are charging for deposits and for example the ECB rate. But again, it's a situation that we'll monitor carefully and if the ECB moves more negative, it's something that we'd have to look at carefully. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, I just ask because you mentioned there was a couple of small, but one-timers in realizing some gains in the first \u2013 in the second quarter, so as those roll off you've got some opportunity to squeeze liability cost to keep NIM flat in 3Q? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, again, first of all, I would take that $5 million out. You see that in the ABS line, those were four discrete prepayments that I do not expect to repeat in Q3. So I would calculate the NIM with that $5 million out of there. And in terms of Q3 and Q4 outlook for NIM, unfortunately, the two main known-knowns are the likely reduction in the Bank of England rate and then just the continued grind in the portfolio as it rolls over if rates stay static. So, I'd say at least near term there is more near term downward pressure on NIM. But that's factored into the points that I made in the prepared remarks and the fact that we expect to be probably modestly above the upper end of the $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion range. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I just have one quick question, or maybe two here. So, you had some peers that were talking about looking to lower non-operational deposits still. But given you just went through a program of lowering non-operational deposits and looked relatively healthy for the SLR and also for CCAR, would you look to actually, if you had the opportunity to expand the balance sheet further if you saw some more chances to add deposits here at this point in time? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Brian, it's Mike, at this point we really feel very positive about the size of the balance sheet and the success that we've had over the last five quarters in managing downward the overall level of excess deposits. So, they were up very modestly Q2 versus Q1 on average, but I don't at this point feel pressure to reduce those further in the second half of the year. And, with any good fortune here maybe in 2017 we'll get some additional Fed Fund increases, maybe even in December and that would probably reduce them further on their own without explicit action. But it's something obviously we monitor very carefully, and particularly in situations where there's potentially a flight to quality, it's something that we'd have to watch very carefully. But at this point, we're really comfortable with the overall size of the balance sheet and the level of excess deposits here in Q2. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And was there any fee waivers left in the second quarter? I know it's not a big deal for you, but just curious. Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, nothing meaningful. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Can you give us an update on the search for the new CFO? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, I'll give you a quick one, Geoff, which it's progressing nicely and I would expect in pretty short order, we would have something to report, so we're getting near the end of the process and I'm pleased with the way the process is going. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Then, you clearly went through a similar exercise two years or three years ago, can you just explain where your focus this time is maybe a bit different from where it was in the past? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'd say we're looking for a world-class CFO of a financial institution, and fortunately the \u2013 what I've found, and you never know, but in this case it's encouraging, is that the State Street brand still has enormous pull in the marketplace. I think people like our story, like our prospects for moving through this regulatory environment. Like the growth story, so we're going to have good choices. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, Jay. Good morning, Mike. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hello? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. Sorry about that. That's okay, and it's been a long call, I know. Mike, can you share with us in the investment securities book, your yield held up well in the quarter and I noticed some of the pieces you gave us, the yields fell for example in the mortgage backed area. But in the asset backed securities area, you had a nice pop in the yield in that portfolio. Can you share with us what was purchased in there or how are you maintaining that 1.92% yield for the entire portfolio? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, so let's see, a couple of different questions in there, Gerard. First, as I mentioned a couple times, we did have four specific securities that were in the asset backed securities category prepay in the second quarter, and the result of those four discrete securities prepaying in total, was a one-time boost to NIR in Q2 of $5 million. So I would urge you to wash that $5 million out of the ABS number. So if you do that, the 1.43% yield for ABS that you see on the average rates page would in fact be closer to flat with the 1.32% from the quarter before it. If you take that piece out, the main factors are the things that we've talked about, which are on the positive side, we've continued to do a very good job of liability pricing discipline and in fact, got some benefit from the higher level of charging for deposits in \u2013 for the euro deposits in particular. Going the other way though, was in fact the impact of the continued grind, where the maturing fixed rate assets tend to mature at a rate lower than the new fixed rate investment. So again, it's a moving picture, obviously, but I'd first wash out the $5 million and then those \u2013 the two points that I just made are the main factors for the quarter. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great, and is it safe to assume the duration really hasn't changed much in that securities portfolio? Michael W. Bell - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it has not changed materially. There has certainly been no material change in our philosophy there, Gerard. So again, it will fluctuate up and down in any given quarter but I wouldn't \u2013 we invest through the cycle, no change in philosophy. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Then, Jay, obviously on your Investor Day you guys have given us the data to support a number of your number one rankings in the businesses you're in, whether it's in the middle market \u2013 middle office outsourcing or U.S. mutual fund accounting. A number of number one rankings. Then since the beginning of 2014, if our calculations are right, it looks like you've won about over $2.5 trillion of assets under custody new business. Then I go to your slide four in today's slide deck, which is a great slide, and I look at the servicing fees from the middle of 2014 through today and there's been no growth. Can you share with us what's going on with that business? Again, considering you're doing so well in winning new business, you're a dominant player, what's causing it not to grow? Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure, I would say you've got to decompose the components, Gerard, and I would say your lead-in was completely accurate and appropriate, in that we are, I would say, disproportionately winning our share of the new business in the marketplace. And whether it's number one in ETFs, where we have close to a 70% share or U.S. mutual funds, where I referenced the offshore domiciles of Luxembourg and Dublin, on and on. What \u2013 the other things that move the needle on that service fee line would be flows and over the period of time that you've referenced, there have been outward flows in some higher yielding products like mutual funds, upward flows in ETFs. You have seen a retrenchment generally from emerging markets which have higher versus lower fees when you get to more traditional asset classes. So, I would say the effect of markets flows and new business are the ingredients which drive that line. And the part I'm most confident about is the new business, the flows we really don't control, but when they move from higher-yielding fee categories to lower-yielding and when they move from products that might be higher revenue products to lower revenue products, we don't influence that, and obviously the markets. So, I would say we think long-term that we are best positioned in those markets that will continue to grow. Things fluctuate over periods of quarters and years. But for us it's making sure that we continue to position against the most attractive clients in the segment and the most attractive segments and making sure that consistent with the Investor Day, that we're keeping our expenses in line, so that we can maintain our margin. And as the environment becomes more favorable for some of those products that I referenced, then we would assume that that would flow to the bottom line. We take a long view. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Appreciate the color. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I will now turn the conference back to management for their closing remarks. Joseph L. Hooley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Jennifer, and thanks, everybody, for your time and attention today. We look forward to speaking with you at the end of the third quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Anthony Ostler : Thank you, Amy. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Mike Bell, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2016 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 3Q '16 slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today; in our 3Q '16 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements; and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change. As with the past few quarters, we are continuing with the new pattern of releasing our financial results on the fourth Wednesday of the month following each quarter end. As such, we expect to hold our fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, January 25, 2017. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased with our performance in 3Q '16 and our ability to deliver positive fee operating leverage for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Our results reflect continued momentum in fee revenue and our ongoing commitment to expense management. Our new business results remain strong with $1.3 trillion in new assets servicing commitments year-to-date including $212 billion in the third quarter. We're making good progress in the implementation of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to digitize our business, deliver significant value and innovation for our clients and lower expenses across the organization. Importantly, through the execution of State Street Beacon we are differentiating our capabilities by providing enhanced analytics and insights to our clients to help manage their enterprise data and enhance their operational performance and risk management. The integration of our recent acquisition of GE Asset Management is going well with over 260 employees successfully on-boarded and client retention exceeding our objectives. This acquisition extends SSGA's core investment management and alternatives capabilities, and enhances the value add solutions to our clients. I'll turn your attention to Slide number 5 to highlight our continued progress against our 2016 strategic priorities. We continue to advance our objective to become a digital leader in financial services to execution of State Street Beacon. Throughout the third quarter of 2016 we continue to improve client service and advanced our goal of creating a digitally enabled platform to improve the breath of product offerings and efficiency. Our platform is providing data quicker, better and with more transparency than ever before. For example, we have delivered a number of new solutions including net asset value oversight, creating more line of sight into the composition of a fund's net asset value at the end of the day, and enhanced asset owner strategy providing support to asset onus as they in-source asset management in enterprise pricing web which prices our clients' funds faster than ever before. We also have a solution to meet the new SEC modernization rules that were finalized early in October, and we are already seeing strong interest from our clients. In terms of driving growth from our core franchise, we continue to achieve strong asset servicing wins with approximately $212 billion in the quarter. Our new business is yet to be installed at quarter-end; it was just over $500 billion. An example of our efforts to build on existing relationships is that we were recently appointed by our long-standing client PIMCO to provide investment manager services outsourcing in support of $1.55 trillion in assets. Separately and a mandate that we have one pending final contract negotiations, PIMCO has selected State Street to provide accounting custody, fund administration, and transfer agency services for an additional $140 billion in offshore funds which is a high growth market segment. State Street's industry leading offshore fund services business, an operating platform with key considerations and PIMCO's decision to consolidate their business with State Street. In our asset management business, we continue to generate new business in our higher yielding product lines with $12 billion in 3Q '16 ETF net inflows. We did experience overall outflows of $36 billion during the quarter, driven primarily by reductions of the cash invested in securities lending, and also money market reform making prime funds less appealing for certain investors, as well as institutional net outflows. Importantly, these outflows were primarily in our lower-based fee institutional products. Separately, our State Street Global Exchange Group recently launched State Street Media Stats, a quantitative investment insights tool that draws from digital media and other large consumer data sets. This platform allows clients to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of data, analyze it, and assess impact on the price risk and liquidity of individual assets. We have now achieved positive fee operating leverage for the first three quarters of 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. State Street Beacon has been a key factor in this progress and is ahead of our original schedule for 2016. We now expect to generate at least $165 million in estimated annual pre-tax expense savings in 2016 with a full effect felt in 2017. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a strong priority and we declared quarterly common stock dividends per share of $0.38 in 3Q '16, an increase of 12% over 2Q '16. We also bought back $325 million in common stock. We are focusing our attention and efforts on these strategic priorities which we expect will allow us to generate positive fee revenue growth and to achieve our objective to generate positive fee basis operating leverage this year relative to 2015. And we would also like to let you know that in line with many of our peers that we will not be hosting in Investor Day in 2017 given our focus on executing our multi-year strategy that we laid out during our 2016 Investor Day. We expect to provide a detailed update at our 2018 event and of course we'll provide updates on progress as we always do each quarter. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to note our announcement in September of the appointment of our new CFO; Eric Aboaf. Eric will join us in mid-December. He served as the CFO at Citizens and prior to that spent a dozen years at Citi, including the last six as Treasurer. Eric brings a wide range of expertise in global banking regulation, treasury, and finance to the role of CFO which he will assume in March of 2017. We truly appreciate Mike's hard work and efforts through the transition and he will continue to be our CFO through the end of 2016 fiscal reporting. We look forward to having Eric join the team to further execute the finance and treasury initiatives in support of our strategic priorities. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the third quarter, and then we'll both be available to take your questions. Mike? Michael Bell : Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. This morning before I start my review of our operating basis results, I'd like to note that our GAAP basis results for the third quarter include two notable items; first, on July 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of GE asset management. Third quarter results included estimated revenue of $65 million, estimated ordinary business expenses of $57 million and approximately $29 million of acquisition-related costs. Second, we reported a pre-tax charge of approximately $42 million related to previously disclosed investigations by U.S. governmental agencies concerning our U.K. transition management business in 2010 and 2011. Now refer to Slide 6 in the slide presentation for a discussion of our operating basis results for 3Q '16 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which I'll refer to as year-to-date. 3Q '16 results reflect continued success managing our expenses and generating fee revenue growth. Operating basis EPS for 3Q '16 increased to $1.35 per share from $1.15 in 3Q '15 and decreased from 2Q '16 which included the benefit from seasonality associated with securities finance. Year-to-date EPS increased 3% compared to the same period a year ago driven by a decrease in expenses and additional share repurchases. Notably 3Q '16 pre-tax margin increased 190 basis points to 30.7% from 28.8% in the year ago period primarily reflecting strong expense management, particularly the continued execution of State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to create cost efficiencies and to digitize our business. On the capital front, in 3Q '16 we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 a share representing an increase of 12%, and we purchased $325 million of our common stock. Moving to Slide 7, we're pleased to achieve significant positive fee operating leverage in 3Q '16 compared to 3Q '15. In addition, as you can see on Slide 8, continued progress in managing expenses has resulted in slight year-to-date positive fee operating leverage compared to the year ago period. Now turn to Slide 9 for review of our 3Q '16 operating basis revenues; servicing fees increased from the year ago quarter and from 2Q '16 primarily due to net new business. Measurement fees increased from 3Q '15 and 2Q '16 primarily reflecting the contribution from the GE asset management acquisition. Foreign exchange revenue decreased from 3Q '15, primarily due to lower volatility and client-related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 3Q '15 primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody and higher spreads in our agency business. Processing fees and other revenue increase from 3Q '15 due to higher revenue associated with tax evasion investments. Moving to Slide 10, net interest revenue decrease from 2Q '16 primarily reflecting lower investment portfolio yields, a temporary increase in wholesale funding in 3Q '16 and small number of discrete security prepayments in 2Q '16. Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review 3Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably expense control continued in 3Q '16, primarily reflecting strong progress for our State Street Beacon program and effective management of our other operating expenses. Excluding the impact from GE asset management, total operating basis expenses decreased from the year-ago quarter driven by Beacon-related savings and a significant reduction in professional services costs, partially offset by higher regulatory expenses and cost of supporting our business. And then move to Slide 13 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to June 30, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased under the fully faced in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by lower risk weighted assets, partially offset by the acquisition of GE asset management. The September 30 fully phased in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and at the bank decreased modestly, primarily due to the GE asset management acquisition. We repurchased $325 million of common stock in 3Q '16 and our common stock purchase program announced in July of 2016. Moving on to the next slide, I'll briefly discuss our recently completed acquisition of GE asset management. The acquisition of GE asset management supports our plan to allocate capital to higher growth and return businesses. In 3Q '16 GE asset management contributed $65 million in estimated operating basis revenue and $57 million in estimated operating basis expenses. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. We expect 4Q '16 fee revenue and expenses from the acquired business to be similar to 3Q '16 levels. Importantly, as the integration progresses we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017. Moving to Slide 15, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. Please note that all of my comments relating to 4Q '16 and full year 2016 outlook exclude the impact from the acquisition of GE asset management. 3Q '16 results reflected strong expense management, as well as fee revenue growth. We expect 4Q '16 results to support our target to achieve positive fee operating leverage for full year 2016 compared to full year 2015 assuming current market conditions. We now expect operating basis fee revenue growth for full year 2016 to be approximately flat versus full year 2015. We expect full year 2016 operating basis expenses to be slightly lower relative to full year 2015; and 4Q '16 operating basis expenses to be slightly higher than 3Q '16 as we increase investments in State Street Beacon and are expected to incur regulatory related expenses. Importantly, we now expect to deliver through the execution of State Street Beacon, at least a $165 million in estimated annual pre-tax savings for full year 2016. Moving on to net interest revenue; we expect 4Q '16 operating basis NIR to be slightly lower than 3Q '16. And for full year NIR to exceed the high-end of our prior full year 2016 static scenario of $2.025 billion to $2.125 billion. In summary, we're pleased as the third quarter positions us well to achieve our 2016 financial objectives. And now, let me turn the call back over to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Thanks, Mike. And Amy, we're now available for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : First question is, is the 165 up from 140 for the full year. Should we think of that as a pull-forward of 2017 Beacon-related costs or is that incremental cost found throughout the process? Michael Bell : Glenn, I would characterize it is a general acceleration in savings, I mean we're still targeting $550 million for the total program but importantly, the $125 billion of savings that we expect for 2017 has not changed. So I really think of it as an overall acceleration, probably some '18 and '19 savings coming into '17 and then some of the '17 savings coming into '16. But importantly at this point, we haven't changed the 550. Glenn Schorr : No problem, we'll still take it. And then in terms of the -- just a lot of moving parts here, so any color would be great. You have decent asset under custody growth but the servicing fee was up 1%. Can we talk about the dynamics of the asset, the type of business you're at because you're winning new business but what's rolling off and what kind of fee compression we're seeing underneath the covers? Joseph Hooley : Yes, let me start that one Glenn. So you're right, the AUC quarter-to-quarter was up pretty nicely, the service fees are up 1%. I'd encourage you not to look at just a quarter, I think if you look at full year, we're up 5% which seems kind of in line with our assets over revenue metric that we use. But I'd say in the third quarter specifically, we were -- you had markets mixed, if or down, domestic markets up, the strong dollar pushed back a little bit on service fees. So that's -- as opposed to 1%, if you look three quarters to-date, the 5% I think is probably a better reflection. The business that we're winning as is typically the case is all over the place. Year-to-date, the EMEA business, largely Europe, has contributed over 50% of the new business wins. Highlighted by -- we talked earlier in the year about the Allianz win and then more recently the PIMCO deal which is a big deal, $140 billion of offshore assets in a place that -- because of Brexit and other things I think will continue to see growth in those offshore domiciles of blocks. And in Dublin, I guess the one other point I might make from a highlight standpoint as you've seen some trail-off in the hedge fund performance, so we've seen some outflows in hedge funds; my view is that that's more likely cyclical, I think performance recently has improved, I suspect the flows may have backed the other way. But the money is going to go somewhere so we've seen more money move to other alternative categories, private equity, real estate which we view as a positive situation from the standpoint of opportunity. So pretty well balanced globally, little bit more of an emphasis on the U.K., on the European markets given some big deals. And a little bit of mix out of hedge but moving to some of the other alternative asset classes is how I kind of characterize the story. Glenn Schorr : Great. Between is the 140 PIMCO included in the 212 for the quarter of new wins? Joseph Hooley : No. Glenn Schorr : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse. Ashley Serrao : Good morning. Jay, did the asset management consolidation has been a theme and you've been active at GE. And it looks like segment margins are moving in the right direction but when you think about the future of the investment franchise, do you think you had the right mix of active passive products or the right European footprint? And would you look to add more capabilities via M&A? Joseph Hooley : Yes, Ashley, let me -- I would say that the GE acquisition was a big step forward and providing a more diversified and frankly, active oriented asset classes, not only in traditional equities in fixed income but also in the alternative classes. So that was the biggest gap that we had and I think we've nicely filled that gap, you've heard from Mike's commentary that we're off to a good start with GE asset management. I think where we've got a pretty decent balance when you look at our passive which still dominates the AUMs in the active business; increasingly we're investing as we talk about in ETFs and we had a good ETF quarter, not just ETFs but higher revenue yielding ETFs which is I think what drove the 5% year-to-date and the 5% quarter-to-quarter revenue uptick. Multi-asset class solutions was another category where solutions generally -- but we can combine passive and active strategies to produce outcomes. It was also a good statement in the third quarter, we had good uptick and flows in the multi-asset class. So I don't -- from an asset class coverage standpoint Ashley, I think we're -- there weren't any huge gaps. Again, I think GE is a -- plugs a big gap and we have high expectations that the GE Group who have good track records and a lot of their strategies can be leveraged against the distribution prowess of State Street. I would say that -- the other last point I would make is that from a geographical standpoint, we're still focused on ETFs in Europe and I would say that's an unfolding story as we build up some of the distribution into the private banks and continue to enhance the product line up but your starting point was the consolidation in the asset management industry and I happen to think that we're probably at -- we're at the beginning of that phase and the end but we feel pretty good with regard to the competencies that we have to compete active, passive and solutions market, globally. Ashley Serrao : Okay, thanks for all the color there. And Mike can you talk about tactical usage of wholesale funding in 3Q? Just walk us through the puts and takes for your 4Q net interest revenue guidance please? Michael Bell : Sure. So Ashley first in terms of a wholesale funding, we did expand our use of wholesale funding in 3Q relative to 2Q by approximately $2.5 billion and we did that basically to accelerate some of the CD issuances that we otherwise would have had in 4Q under a normal operating environment, just given all the uncertainty in the turbulence. As a result of our money market reform, we just thought it was prudent to go ahead and essentially advance finance the -- with higher levels of wholesale CDs in the 3Q. And so that cost us obviously some NIR but we expect that to be really relatively temporary because I would expect to get back to normal in 4Q. So as we think about the role forward from 3Q to 4Q, it really -- Ashley it's mainly the story that we've talked about previously, we -- the portfolio turnover particularly in Europe continues to see maturing securities at higher yields than what we're able to reinvest those funds in at today, and so as a result of that grind in the rates we would expect to see modestly lower NIR in 4Q versus 3Q. There are lot of moving parts in any given -- in a given quarter but those are really the headlines. Ashley Serrao : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawkins with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So just a question on Beacon for next year, I know Glenn touched on it but just to dig a little deeper, initially I think that the profile for cost savings on the program was to show an increase in 2017 versus the savings you initially expected in 2016. Normally when these programs are devised, the second year -- it works out better than the first. Why shouldn't investors believe that that general profile and trajectory would remain intact despite -- and the idea that you had better savings this year would only lead to even better results next year. Michael Bell : Sure, Brennan, it's Mike. In terms of a Beacon, first off, maybe just stepping back from your question for just a second; I would emphasize -- I really feel like we've done a very good job in terms of project Beacon, not just on the expense side but also some of the improvements that have helped our overall service levels for our clients. So overall, we're feeling really good about the program at this point. In terms of your question specifically around the savings, the net savings in 2017 versus 2016, at this point Brennan we expect that there will be a continued uptick in investments that we're making around Beacon and we believe that those investments will pay-off handsomely in 2018, 2019, 2020; but as a result of accelerating some of the savings into 2016 and given just a track record that we're on right now, we think it's also a good idea to work to accelerate some of the investment so that includes investments in IT, development spending, testing, infrastructure all things that we believe will position us with even more confidence for 2018 and beyond savings. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. So in that number and there is a lot going on beneath the surface. Michael Bell : That's exactly, right. Brennan Hawken : Thanks, Mike. And then a follow-up, pointing back a little bit, when we think about the pressure that's expected to come to bear on -- particularly for the asset management business, the broker sold active side and your clients therefore deal well. Is there a way that you are adjusting your services or offerings or positioning yourself to provide further and more enhanced support for those clients as they work their way through this significant changed and how can you basically make sure you're well positioned to capitalize on potential opportunities as they come out. Michael Bell : Yes, Brennan, let me handle this -- handle that question and I'll take in two dimensions. I'll first take it from an asset management dimension which maybe was where you were initially headed but from a fiduciary rule the impact of that on product and distribution, I think it leads to a more model based product and as Jay just recently in last couple weeks announced a distribution agreement with RBC where they are using -- we've got an investment and a robo advisor which will use the robo advisor to provide asset allocation among ETFs sold through the RBC distribution channel. So I think that model which in this case happens to be sponsored by SSGA is one of the things that you'll see going forward given the impact of the fiduciary rule. I think if you flip over to the asset servicing side, the fact that we have invested heavily in the ETF servicing platform to provide a lot of online metrics to not only authorized participants but to distributors position us well as ETFs and other more were quantitative model driven products are packaged in order to satisfy the needs of the fiduciary rule. I think you could also say and this isn't a direct link, but the work we're doing in Beacon, which has the effect and we're already seeing some of this from a service provider standpoint of giving our clients kind of full transparency into the calculation of net asset values and all the things that result, and end of day pricing for a product, or a group of products. I think it vantage the distributors from a standpoint of being able to pull out -- all that together in a timely manner in order to price products at the end of the day. So, I would say in sum that would be on the servicing side, I think ETF and other quantitative model different products will be a key contributor to how distribution, really how a product evolves to suit the fiduciary rule. And I think some of the work we're doing in Beacon the speed, the turnaround, the transparency of pricing will also advantage the product manufacturers, who are key clients in order to provide effective packaging of product, to meet the new fiduciary role. Brennan Hawken : Great, thanks for all that color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks to morning. might be a little bit of a subtlety but seems like a slight change in your outlook for full year fees, kind of coming in more flattish than modestly higher and you had a really good quarter in aggregate, so I am just wondering is there something that we should be thinking about third the fourth or just -- or some little conservative as built-in given the macro environment. Michael Bell : Yes Ken, its Mike. It's really the latter, a couple things. And again I view these as very minor tweaks as opposed to anything not wholesale, but if I look at the macro environment for a second, the currency impact particularly in the U.K. is a headwind for the rest of the year, as compared to where it was earlier in the year pre-Brexit. So, as an example; the pound based revenue that we have is approximately 8% of our overall revenue, we get some benefit obviously on the expense side of that but the -- if I just focus on the fee revenue the weakness in the pound hurts the translation to it to U.S. dollars. Second, as Jay talked about a minute ago there continues to be some risk off in the environment, and just even looking at some of the mix change for example from the outflows from hedge funds, is a mild headwind for example for the AIS fees. And then, I look at the SVP 500 this morning. I think it was at 21.43 and that's off from where it's been, so again can I really view these as tweaks hopefully three months from now we'll look back and say it's it was conservative but that's the that's the base -- the basic thinking. Ken Usdin : Okay, thanks Mike. And then similar question on the expense side cost came in pretty good again. Can you help us understand how much of that Beacon 1.65 was already in the third quarter run rate as opposed to yet lingering pieces yet to come, and the type of magnitude of third the fourth quarter step up that you're expecting under the surface again, I know you get a little help there on the FX side, so just helping us understand the moving parts there too, thanks. Michael Bell : Sure. No absolutely. So you Ken, first of all on expenses the beacon savings we really have at this point captured the beacon savings that we expect for 2016-run rate. So as an example we expect net investments in fourth quarter of 2016 to exceed the additional savings that will get in in 4Q 2016, now as I talked about earlier we expect those investments to pay-off very well in 2017, 2018, 2019 particularly in 2018, 2019 so we think given our track record. We think that\u2019s very shareholder friendly to make those investments at that level. Round numbers can -- we\u2019re looking at approximately $10 million of additional investment spending for beacon 4Q versus 3Q. So it's not huge but it's enough to potentially move the needle, and the other piece that just continues to be an area of pressure, is the regulatory expense, particularly the RRP spending to be focused on for the July 1, 2017 submission continues to be material. But I think if we step back from the details in your questions, I would come back to the fact that I think we've done a very good job at managing expenses overall for the full year. Project Beacon obviously has been a big piece of that but also just clamping down, on all of the areas and we're real pleased to be in a position to say that we expect a full year expenses to be below that, of 2015 XGE. Ken Usdin : And Mike, just one quick follow up on the last point there, just do you think that's an achievable goal to look forward to again on the operating basis X.G.E type of thing, to try to keep that cost outlook a slightest possible as you look forward. Michael Bell : Yes, Ken I think -- First I'd say it's a little bit early to be giving 2017 expectations, but I think it's fair to say to your underlying point that regardless of the environment; expense management is going to be a very, very high priority for us next year. And again as I said I'm in this difficult environment to be able to achieve positive fee operating leverage for the first nine months is a really good -- a really good accomplishment. And next year we've got the Beacon 1.25, we expect to get some additional benefit from replacing the outside consultants with FTE's, which is a positive economic parade's, we will get some extra benefit from that in 2017. We continue to focus on the margin target that we talked about back at the Investor Day of 31% for 2018, and we were really -- we continued to rivet on that. So I would say too early to give you specifics we'll give you more in three months but those are the areas that we're really focused on. Ken Usdin : Okay, thanks a lot Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from one of Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe you could talk a little bit about in this stress test, you're finding the leverage ratio -- Troll [ph] had a speech where he talked about in the future stress test, maybe proposing keeping market based on assets flat. How could you help with that for you in the stress to be -- It's so easy for us in the outside to see the moving parts inter our quarter, so, is it fair to think that could be a material help in future C-course. Michael Bell : Jim, its Mike. First of all a couple things broadly and then come back to your specific question. The first your cruel speech and the in the P.R. that came out that day at this point it is simply a proposed rule, so I think until things get finalized. I wouldn't I overweight them too much, but what you're underline point is an important one. Yes, keeping the balance sheet flat as opposed to the previous Fed modeling which had the balance sheet growing, under the stress scenario is particularly helpful to us, because C-car leverage rather than the risk based ratios, has been our binding constraint historically. So again I don't expect that will be a lot of impact on the next C-car because it sounded like most of the impact would come into play beginning with 2018 C-car, but that's certainly a helpful item and some of the other potential changes, which impact the riskiest capital ratios, again would likely have less impact on us because the Tier 1 leverage has been a binding constraint. But I'd say it's early Jim, it's a positive but it's also it's an early days positive at this point. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair. Just on an outlook on NIL with a rate hike potentially in December; how should we think about that in fact over the following 12-months, any thoughts? Joseph Hooley : Sure, Jim. Well first of all, a rate hike if I just isolate on that causal factor first, I would expect a rate hike to be helpful, to be accretive for us. I mean I would expect it will probably keep less of the benefit from the next Fed funds rate hike that we got from the last one, which almost all of it accrued to -- so I think will probably have some modest increase on the liability side for our clients, but I do expect net to be accretive. First of all, it obviously helps us with our foreign [ph] rate securities here in the U.S. It helps us with our loan book; which is mostly floating rate; it helps us with obviously the central bank deposits. And so all of that I would expect to be greater than the impact on the client deposit rates. The other piece just to be balanced though, it would likely translate to a little bit higher wholesale CD costs and also our senior debt significant portion of that is floating rate. So it's not all gravy but it would definitely expected to be accretive. Just to be balanced though. That's -- your question was focused on the U.S. As I mentioned earlier we do continued to see the negative impact of the portfolio turnover in Europe, the combination of negative rates, and also depressed spreads because of QE over there. So we want to balance that out and in obviously as we talked beginning in January about 2017 outlook, will get some perspective on that. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Jay, maybe if I can ask about middle office business, I mean do you see at this through stage of the game, where we're moving into a more competitive environment for active asset managers. Essentially more outsourcing of net Office asset managers, I guess you could you expect more big contracts coming from large asset managers and it's huge. and then it sounds like Bank of New York is also getting a little bit more aggressive obviously with the TRO-DO [ph] and also on even within their more standardized, if you could sort of differentiate yourself in that space and talk about whether you think just change and the growth outlook and in pricing dynamics in net office. Joseph Hooley : Sure Brian, let me take that. The short answer is yes, as there is more pressure on returns which translates into more downward pressure on the asset management industry and there's been an acceleration I caught in the last couple of years towards outsourcing more. And some of the deals that we spoke about, being probably the most prominent one is anchored in not only back office but middle office. I would say we've -- we're probably seeing more demand for more comprehensive solutions than I can recall in the past several years, and I think it's a direct result of your comment. So I do see middle office, back office, comprehensive outsourcing deals, transfer agency and more and more coming at us in a bundled way, or even in the form of and I say that PIMCO and Allianz are separate transactions, both reflect consolidation of more work with a single provider. So I think all that's in play and all that should accrue to our benefit. If I isolate a middle office for a minute, you're familiar with the league tables. We have over 10 trillion in metal office assets that we support on our technology, and like most of the activities that we conduct in the servicing business scale matters. So it was over ten trillion and in scale, we have the ability to drive down unit cost, we have the ability with best disproportionally in our unit in our middle office platform. So I take you back to Beacon, which is as we automate create more straight through processing as we on the back of the middle office, have a data GX aggregation product. The scale should provide a significant advantage for us. I think product for product we compare very favorably from a middle office capability and standpoint, because of the breadth of services that we support. And I do think and I'm going to this is a pivot if you go from middle office to what the next frontier, it\u2019s who is going to win the data aggregation war. And we've got just short of 10 clients who are committed to us, to allow us to be the data aggregator not just for the information that we hold in our back and middle office, but for all their other custodian activities as well. And to me that ties directly into beacon but the long game here is if you can be the date aggregator you get the preferred look at data and analytics capabilities, we referenced a few in my prepared comments. A drift on your question, but I think it's a good one which is there is continued and there will be ongoing pressure in the asset management industry, all of which should position us to provide more services, knowing more services but more value added services as we were up to the data aggregation and Global Exchange level. Brian Bedell : Okay, that\u2019s actually good follow on. Maybe just one more mid Office and then on the data aggregation and that would be in mid office you mentioned using scale as a competitive advantage. Would you think that would translate into lower pricing for the industry -- you feel you can compete more on price rather than improve the margins in a business that you can question, and the you just mentioned on and on data aggregation and I guess I usually ask you to sort Investor Day about the revenue potential impact for that. So, I don't know if you can give better data if you provide any sort of big picture idea about whether you do think there will be some revenue traction in 2017, from the data aggregation initiative. Joseph Hooley : Sure. So let me take the first one, first middle office pricing scale effect, margin question. I think that convinced that because of the scale we have, we have lower unit cost to perform in the middle office, we've done a good job of standardizing that. But we don't sell it that way. I mean what we sell is middle office deal is usually transplanting something that's done internally to an outsourced model, so we're selling the value not the price advantage, and I think that people that's that evaluate our middle office they view it against their own in-house capabilities, and they view us making the investment in technology; usually in more contemporary platforms to be a big advantage. So I say the scale of fact is to our advantage. We work hard not to lead with price but yet lead with value and preserve the margins and the point is obvious, but as the asset management industries under pressure, we're feeling that pressure too. So the ability to differentiate and show collectively how we can provide a more effective, a more efficient model when we combine our customers front office, our middle back etc. is really the way we look at that. With regard to data aggregation and global exchange; I think it's a slow building opportunity, The I'll just pause on data aggregation for a minute, the more you do it the very you get the greater advantage you have which is once we wired together not only our digital back and middle office but we start to wire other custodians back in middle office. There's a huge advantage to somebody bringing business to us, because we've already pre-wired those relationships and so we're making a pretty big investment and what we call data G.X. which is the aggregation layer of information not just for State Street, but for other institutions. I think that you've seen some of the media stats and other data, and analytics products that sit on top of that. And I think that's when you really start to see some revenue momentum. So, I'd say it's a slow burn but a steady upward bias on the revenue side and as we get into 2017 we'll see if we can find a way to provide some dimension around that for you. Brian Bedell : That would be great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Good morning. I want to follow-up on the asset management, just a couple questions. So, I guess just on GE business, clearly the margins are pretty low. I guess like in a low teen's right now. As you guys think about integrating this business, what are you guess the margins can -- I guess ultimately go to? That\u2019s part a, and I guess part B. I recall when you announced the deal there was a piece of business that hasn't closed as part of the transaction, maybe an update on kind of where that revenue stands and one of the probability of that revenue chunk kind of coming in over the next few quarters as well. Joseph Hooley : Let me take that, Alex. As you point out that GE Asset Management margins at the beginning are not what we'd like to see and part of the synergy opportunities which is inherent in the deal, and which is late likely to unfold over the next two or three quarters, should get that margin at least up to where SSGA is but we have margin aspirations that far exceed what SSG is today and that's part of -- Part of that mix that leads to the 31% and 33% margin targets out in 2018 and 2020. So I think that at least the first couple of steps that are well-understood and we're well on our way and I have high confidence that what would achieve those synergy opportunities. With regard to the incremental GE business, other GE affiliates that we could bring into the mix, making great progress. Huge and helpful support by GE and I suspect that we will bring most of that incremental opportunity into this next; which is our office and CIO kind of business, which is just makes us bigger and more impactful in that segment. Alex Blostein : Yes, make sense. And then Mike, quick question for you on the balance sheet or really around the deposit pricing; you guys have been able to successfully flex from us on last couple quarters, stepping down a little bit, I guess again in 3Q, how much room I guess is there to continue to charge for deposits outside the U.S. because an thinking been helping you guys off on a cost. Michael Bell : Sure Alex, we'll first appreciate as the kudos and you're absolutely right. I think we've done a very good job of that in 2016 and say a couple things, first this continues to be a work in process and as we look at 2017, as I mentioned earlier on the headwinds that we have overall for NIR is the portfolio turnover particularly in Europe with the negative rates and the very well credit spreads, that the grind is truly material for NIR for 2017. So one of the things that we're looking at is, what can we offset that by additional actions on the liability of pricing side, and I would say at this point we're simply looking at various options not the point at this point, ready to announce some additional actions but that is an area that we're keenly focused on. And then second, obviously if the ECB cuts further, we have to look harder ourselves at following at least any document that the E.C.B. would make, so early days of this, but this continues to be a huge area focus for us, Alex, both here in Boston as well as our R&M [ph] management team. Alex Blostein : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi can you talk about the CFO transition, you're 30% done with Beacon, 70% more to go and you have one CFO passing the baton to another CFO. In the midst of a major restructuring and digitization program, and also I wasn't clear, so Mike, will be leaving December, and then you have a new CFO. Coming in March or just can you explain how that handoff works. Joseph Hooley : Sure, happy to do that. Mike, first let me talk about the baton handoff. Eric Aboaf joined mid-December, and so, he will observe the year-end close, Mike will be with us through year-end through the close of the 2016 books. And then Mike will transition out, Eric will be on board. I might take this opportunity just to talk just for a minute about Eric's background, I think you know some of it, but he, in his most recent six years with Citi, he was the treasurer of the before that, but like an equivalent period ran the financial planning and analysis part of Citi, and within that also oversaw the custody business. So importantly, he is -- he comes to us not just with the financial expertise but with very direct experience in the asset servicing business. With regard to your opening point Mike the beacon activity, well, Mike certainly reports on it and has some visibility to what it was largely centered in the operating environment. So Mike Rogers who's the President's Chief Operating Officer is really on point with most of the Beacon activity, some of that would affect the corporate support groups, but it's primarily in the-- asset servicing custody middle office back office, so I would see no blip in transition, and we only hope that Eric with his knowledge of this business might bring a fresh set of eyes and new insights to what more we can do. And I think to an earlier point, and you've seen it this year we started out with a plan for Beacon we accelerate that plan, and nobody here is expecting the sun to shin on the environment, so we are working hard to find new opportunities in order to accelerate beacon, expand beacon and I would hope that Eric would be nothing, but a fresh set of eyes to see what things you might have missed. Unidentified Analyst : And just one follow up year-to-date pretax operating margin of 29% is flat year over year and it's below some of your peers, and I know your target is 33%, so in simple terms like if you're explaining it, your elevator pitch, why and how can a margin improvement 29% to 33%? Michael Bell : Mike, it's simply through the probably the execution of a project Beacon, I mean we do expect the expense saves from Project Beacon to drop to the bottom line, and ultimately by the combination of the program in year 2020, to be at that 33%, I would also suggest to you that you have an even earlier milestone to what can\u2019t give that we're focused on the 31% margin in 2018, so they'll be a report card coming up on that Mike, quite a bit sooner. Joseph Hooley : And let me not lose the opportunity to, I know with, in this -- with this audience in this discussion we tend to focus on the cost effective Beacon, but I can't overstate enough how impactful it is when our clients start to see the impact of better data, better information, they now have transparency into how we make the sausage with regard to the net asset value calculation. When your client start to see the positive impact of this effort, it just energizes everybody to go faster do more, and we've started to see that just in the last couple quarters. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning, a couple questions on the balance sheet, just wanted to understand if you feel like there's any opportunity to be pulling down non-operating deposits from here, or have you done everything that you think you need to do on that side, just thinking about the balance sheet side and how you think it\u2019s going to reject over the next couple quarters. Michael Bell : Sure Betsy, its Mike. I think it\u2019s fair to say that particularly with money market reform and the turbulence there, that there is likely to be some upward pressure on non-operational deposit levels in in Q4. Now I feel good is we were back in 2015 we did a really good job at managing that mainly focused on client pricing and really just working with clients to figure out other alternatives for them, but that's an area where you know there's certainly the potential for upward pressure. Beyond that I really would go back to some of the earlier discussion around Europe. I think that's the area that we're also focused on in terms of tighter ability pricing, some of that may also push down excess deposits which would be just fine. But the liability pricing in Europe will also be a high priority for us over the next several months. Betsy Graseck : Okay, then we obviously had one rate hike, we're expecting another one in the not distant future, as these rates have gone up. Is there anything that you can point to suggest that maybe some of your non- operating deposits should be classified as operating, because you talk us through what the timeframe is and the fact pattern that you need to see in order to do that. I am asking a question with the background of trying to understand if theirs is an opportunity to a potential extent duration the securities book can pick up some that way over the coming quarters. Joseph Hooley : Sure. So Betsy, first it's early days but we do have work under way, and really it's an ongoing initiative not a onetime episodic event, to look at and carefully characterize our deposits, as operational or non-operational. I would expect that work will continue through 2017, and at this point I would expect that we'll probably get some benefit as a result of that. This points way too early; I wouldn't try to quantify the NRI benefit for you, or the overall level of deposits but I do think that's an area of the upside opportunity. Betsy Graseck : Okay, but new change to construction investments at this stage? Joseph Hooley : Not at this point and certainly no change in philosophy, and if in fact we didn't see the some of the deposits that historically been characterized as non-operational, if we saw them being more sticky then that's something we would certainly look at it at that point time. Betsy Graseck : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Jay, can he share with us the -- obviously the GE deal is close now on stage three historically over the years has done acquisitions. What are you seeing in terms of the outlook not asking if you're going to do a deal next quarter, but can you give us some color of what's going on in terms of potential further acquisitions that either in custody or Asset Management. Joseph Hooley : Yes, Gerard. I would say we just came through a cycle of three-year strategic planning with the board and acquisitions weren't a big part of that conversation, so I would say that [indiscernible] this is unlikely the little A is more likely. And when I think of places where we could perhaps use little help on, and it's probably more the product side. The two places I land would be an asset management, and not contrary to my earlier point, I think we've got a pretty comprehensive set of capabilities and asset management but if there was a team or there are a couple of narrow gaps in the asset classes, that could be in scope. And then the other big place that I would talk about potentially growth or expansion through acquisition would be in the business that we call Global Exchange, which I referenced earlier in the data aggregation and the more importantly on top of that, data analytics business or the data analytics opportunities which I think is significant. It is a real battleground for a number of different financial firms. It would be my expectation that we would; if you take data analytics and first and separate those two things the data is the one part, and I think in some respects is the harder part, which is aggregating and providing real time data insights to the front office, but on top of that is analytics; whether it's risk analytics, whether it's some of the things we do with Big Data.  I could see smallish acquisitions on the data analytics side, which would it take advantage of the data position we have to provide more robust analytics. So those would be the two places that potentially we would be advantaged by smallish acquisitions versus organic development. I don't see in a pure cussedness basis to state the obvious. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, if the pure custody and episodic event happened where is some of these large portfolio came up with no interest or you would have to always consider something like that. Joseph Hooley : I think that two things I would say; one I think that the regulatory hurdle would be high for the big asset servicing firms, to be further concentrated in the in the custody business. And then I would also say that traditionally whether it was the Deutsche Bank acquisition or IBT or even in Sao Paolo [ph], it filled the gap to reach a Bank in Europe and Tesa [ph] in Italy; and I don't see real gaps, if I look at our geographic coverage. we'd love to be doing more in China or India we\u2019re all over it acquisitions not likely the way to get there. Other than that we're pretty well developed and most of the markets that would be attractive asset servicing markets, and if you look at them -- looked at through a product lines, Gerard, I think if you look at a fall away from beta where we have over 60% share on the ETF servicing to the traditional asset classes to the alternatives. Again we're pretty well positioned. Now we think there's a meaningful opportunity in the real estate asset class, which is going to brimming with assets to do more outsourcing there, but so, I just don't see -- I don't see big gaps and I think it would be a high hurdle for a regulatory standpoint. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then shifting to the balance sheet; Mike, I know the securities portfolio to watch your senior secured bank loans as you show on page 12, the $3.5 billion portfolio that you have, can you give us a flavor for where you see that going over the next 12-months, relative to this balance sheet, is a going to grow or stay that size. And second, what do you guys assuming for through the cycle loss rate from that portfolio. Michael Bell : So Gerard, first in terms of the overall loss size; again no change in an overall law philosophy, so I would expect that our leverage loan block would continue to be a relatively small portion of the overall balance sheet, perhaps modest growth from where it is today. We have a yield on that block currently of approximately 3.7%. So it's an attractive book, and at this point we've had and would of very good credit experience there. I feel like we're doing a good job of under-running and managing the credits there. But I really wouldn't put it just point Gerard, a long term expectation out there again, I would expect to beat the overall portfolio averages, given our credit underwriting and our bias towards being at the higher end of the scale, so at this point I wouldn't try to put a long term estimate on it, but it's something that will continue to manage and we're very sensitive to the changes in the credit cycle. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, appreciate the answer. Operator : Your next question comes Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, I have a couple of question, especially on servicing, I'm going to go back to the first question if I look on page 12 of your supplement. And I look at year-to-date '16 versus year-to-date '15; servicing fees are down 1.1%, sometime to reconcile that with the earlier comment and even if I adjust that for the FX fee revenue, let's assume we give all of that tip to servicing, it's basically flattish year-to-date '16 versus year-to-date '15 and I'm comparing that with your AUCA 3Q '16 versus 3Q '15; it's up 7% and in fact if I do similar rough FX adjustment, probably up 8%. So can you help explain; A) but year-to-date you're down 1.1% in your operating servicing fee revenues; why that application, why such a big gap versus your AUCA? Michael Bell : Sure Vivek, its Mike. First of all, a couple things are very important here. Number one, as we talked about earlier, we've seen a challenging change in the business mix here in 2016, relative to 2015. It was talked about this on prior calls. We've seen for example more pressure on emerging markets than what we've seen here in the in the U.S. And so basically the impact of seeing rotation from emerging markets for example, to the developed markets particularly the U.S. is a real negative impact on the ratios that you're looking at there.  Second, as we talked about earlier we've seen some outflows in terms of hedge funds in particular, not all hedge funds but certainly that's been a negative in terms of our overall AIS revenue, and as we talked about previously our AIS revenue also tends to be a higher unit revenue per asset service, than the other books of businesses. And then on top of that, if you do adjust for the currency and markets, that really is the story; all the more reason that I would strongly suggest you look at the overall margins on the business as opposed to looking at the ratios relative to assets because that the -- all the factors that I just mentioned play havoc with those ratios, particularly if you're looking at it in a short-term period. Vivek Juneja : Okay, got it. So it's a higher fee businesses that are really facing more. It's a mix shift there. Michael Bell : And importantly, you know, obviously we don't have a crystal ball in the future but as Jay talked about earlier we do expect over the long haul to get some help from things like additional outsourcing opportunities for private equity funds, as well as real estate funds; that would actually help the mix over the over the long-term. In addition, I think it's fair to say that -- over the long-term we think emerging markets is in fact a very good place to be in and ultimately we would expect that the -- we'll see some rotation back there and we'll see some help on the currency side there relative to what has been a challenging environment; certainly caught over the last year. Vivek Juneja : Okay, got it. ETF fees could either -- if you will talk a little bit about what you're seeing on EPS pricing as when more talk about so much your competitor is cutting pricing on those? Joseph Hooley : Yes Vivek, let me take that. This is Jay. There has been and I think that we were part of that the next several quarters ago when adjusted some of the fees and some of our -- I call it commoditized type ETFs. We continue to focus our efforts on introducing ETFs that are more differentiated and therefore have a better revenue characteristics to them. So we don't foresee although we always look at whether or not it makes sense for us to adjust fees in order to gain volume but again this is isn't the more commoditized market. I think they will continue to be put pressure in those commoditized one. Mike, I don't know if we have a ETF yield for the third quarter; the $12 billion ETF? Michael Bell : I don't have that off my head Jay, we can certainly with IR follow-up on that. Joseph Hooley : We can get you that, Mike gave you a sense of -- close to 10 basis points would be the yield on the ETF flows in the third quarter, just to give you some sense. Vivek Juneja : Great, and that thanks early, is the key driven last quarter or two after you sort of cleaned up the pricing couple of quarter go? Michael Bell : Yes, I think those -- I think it is fairly sticky other than keep in mind spy which is the big S&P500, it can be -- can act like a trading security, particularly around quarter end. So if I isolate that I would agree with your comment, it's been pretty steady. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just a quick question on the GE deal and potential expenses that you're looking for in the first half of '17? Can you just maybe outline not the number -- I know you won't give that but where you expect to see expenses coming from? I know you mentioned before that there were enough services client already but so I would imagine expenses there is just personnel or where else to be coming from? Joseph Hooley : Yes, let me start that Brian, and then Mike can jump in. You know I think that if you look at the GE asset management deal, whenever you combine two asset management deals you should expect a fair amount of synergy in the course and the core -- corporate support kind of activities and so that's one big bucket of opportunity. But another would be that while GE brought some capabilities that were not robust at SSGA, namely the alternatives; there were some alternatives at SSGA and maybe more importantly, they also brought a pretty significant fundamental equity and fixed income set of capabilities. And shortly after the announcement we announced a reorganization which brought those groups together; so there is a fair amount of synergy just tied up and when you take your fundamental equity business at SSGA combine it with GE and get synergies off that. So I would say from the corporate support areas, and also in the different asset classes where -- in many cases SSGA had some capabilities, just not as robust as the GE asset management. Would you add anything to that Mike? Michael Bell : Yes, the only thing I would add Jay; and Brian, to your question is -- while we haven't given you specific synergy numbers. I would remind you that we funded the GE acquisition through the prep issuance and as a result of expecting that the overall transaction will be -- we expect to be accretive in the first full 12-months beginning of July 1, 2016. You can basically conclude that the earnings contribution we expect from the organization including the synergies that Jay just mentioned would be more than sufficient to pay for the cost of the prep. So that at least gives you a way to size what we're expecting from the expense synergies and the additional revenue that Jay mentioned earlier. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. And then just one quick one; I know you mentioned the ops servicing space a couple different times here; here is a source of fee pressure, but are you seeing greater pressure than what the overall industry is with regards to the redemption in the overall performance? I mean it's basically down X percent, are you seeing something a multitude above that? Joseph Hooley : No, I would say now and probably even a little less, were anchored in some of the bigger, more institutional names; and I say they have weathered the storm a little bit better than the rest of the industries. And we also -- it's a point of view but I think if you look at performance, performance recently has improved and so I suspect this is not a secular but rather a cyclical trend where assets flow in and out. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great, thanks. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Hello, thank you for taking the question. On the GE asset management acquisitions, what you talk about that before it sounded like you were expecting a ramp up in expenses and synergies to get started in 4Q and now it sounds like 4Q, the contribution is going to be similar to the third quarter and then the ramp up happens more next year. So I just wondered if there has been any changes the way you're thinking around that timing there? Michael Bell : Geoff, its Mike. No particular change, we do expect to see some incremental benefit in Q4 from the organizational changes that Jay mentioned a minute ago. The main point here is just to emphasize that we expect the bulk of the expense and revenue synergies to really kick in Q1 of '17. Geoffrey Elliott : Great, thank you. Joseph Hooley : Thank you, Amy; and thank you everyone for joining us on the call. We look forward to speaking with you in January when we discuss the fourth quarter results. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. In reviewing our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results, I want to reinforce that our performance reflects the strength of our business and our commitment to advancing key strategic priorities that supports State Streets growth. I'm pleased with our 2016 performance, our major accomplishments and the substantial progress we made to address strategic priorities. In a challenging year, we stayed focused on our client needs, invested in new products and solutions including the acquisition of GE Asset Management, accelerated the pace of State Street Beacon digitization initiatives and achieved positive fee operating leverage for the full year, excluding the impact of the acceleration of deferred compensation expense in 4Q '16. As I just mentioned, we recorded a compensation expense in fourth quarter '16 reflecting the elimination of the service requirement from the churns of our outstanding deferred cash awards. This accelerated expense will give us the flexibility to improve the mix of cash in equity in our incentive compensation and our organization in future years, which will improve recruitment and retention of talent. Mike will take you through the details of this in a few minutes. Now, if I refer you to Slide number 5 on the slide deck. I'll walk you through some of our key achievements this past year. We made advances on our strategic priority to digitize the Company through States Street Beacon delivering tangible service improvement benefits to clients. By making advances in our goal of digitizing end-to-end, we're leveraging our strength as a middle and back office provider to deliver integrated solutions that improve the data, speed and overall service experience to our clients. We're investing in solutions to deliver client value across all of our businesses, including the data and analytics to help clients comply with SEC modernization. We're also delivering data GX's capabilities to support our asset on our clients as they in source asset management. We also continue to drive growth from our core franchise. We recorded net asset servicing wins of approximately 1.4 trillion for the year, including a 180 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting strong growth with significant participation from Europe. Many of the large wins in 2016 that we highlighted to be represent clients consolidating the relationship with State Street. For example in the fourth quarter, we expanded our relationship with Allianz Global Investors that extends their existing service relationship into a strategic role of partnership to deliver a broad spectrum of global investment servicing solutions, including custody and accounting services. As a result of a decision to the versified providers, Blackrock will move a portion of their assets, largely common trust funds, currently with State Street to another service provider. State Street remains a significant service provider to Blackrock and the transition will not be fully complete until 2018 and represents just over $1 trillion in assets. In our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was just over 440 billion. In our SSgA asset management business, overall we experience net flows of 16 billion during the fourth quarter. In our ETF business, we have 36 billion in fourth quarter 2016 net inflows and 52 billion full year 2016 net inflows, which partially reflects traditional fourth quarter seasonality into SPY, our S&P 500 ETF, but also reflects continuous investment in our ETF product portfolio and distribution. SSgA also finished 2016 with approximately 46 billion in assets under management across our target date strategies, a nearly 50% increase in 2015. We continue to invest in developing products and services that will enable us to meet client needs and drive differentiation. Recent examples include expansion of the suite of environmental, social and governance or ESG investment products at SSgA. We recently launched Currenex X2, a next generation institutional foreign exchange trading platform with enhanced capabilities to help our clients' trade more rapidly and with greater functionality. And our investment in blockchain distributed ledger application trials to seek to automate or improve the accuracy and processing speed of some of our more complex transactions such as syndicated loans, securities lending and collateral management. We remain committed to expense control, as reflected by our full year positive fee operating leverage of 51 basis points for 2016 versus 2015, excluding the effects of the fourth quarter accelerated deferred compensation expense. And through State Street Beacon, we achieve approximately a 175 million an annual pretax expense savings. And during 2016 through share repurchases and common share dividends, we returned just over 1.9 billion of capital to common shareholders. I want to go over up four strategic priorities for 2017 that we have led out for you on Slide 6. These are underway now built upon our momentum coming out of 2016 and support our long-term growth and transformation process into a digital leader and financial services. The priorities include advancing our digital leadership through State Street Beacon, continuing to drive growth from our core franchise, continuing to invest in new products and solutions and achieving our financial goals including generating positive fee operating leverage and continuing to return capital to shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to welcome Eric Aboaf, who will be moving into the CFO role by early March. Eric joined us in December and is here with us today, but will not a speaking role in today's call. Eric will be speaking in the first quarter call on April 26th. I'd also like to take a moment to thank Mike Bell for all of his work supporting the firm and our key initiatives. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike who will review our financial performance for the fourth quarter as well as our outlook for 2017, and following that Mike and I will be available to answer your questions. Mike? Mike Bell : Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. This morning, I'll start my review of our fourth quarter 2016 and full year 2016 results on Slide 7. Slide 7 highlights two notable items that impacted 4Q '16 and full year 2016 GAAP and operating basis results. First, we recorded tax benefits amounting to a total of $0.54 of earnings per share. This includes a $145 million associated with the designation of certain of our foreign earnings as indefinitely invested overseas based upon our review of our need for capital liquidity in future investment. The income tax benefits also include a $66 million tax benefit attributable to incremental foreign tax credits and a foreign affiliate tax loss. Second, as Jay mentioned, we accelerated the expense associated with outstanding deferred cash incentive compensation awards to our employees below the level of Executive Vice President are removing the continued service requirement associated with these existing deferred cash awards. The schedule of the patents of these existing awards has not changed. The impact of this acceleration increased 4Q '16 expenses by approximately $249 million. The expense that would otherwise have been associated with these cash-settled incentive compensation awards will no longer be reflected in future periods. The acceleration of the expense is expected to financially allow us to increase the immediate cash component of the incentive compensation in future periods relative to the mix in our awards in the recent years. Importantly, we expect the expense impact of increasing the mix of cash in 2017 incentive awards will approximately offset the going-forward effects of the 4Q '16 acceleration in 2017. Now, turn to Slide 8 in the slide presentation for a summary of our operating basis results for full year 2016 and 4Q '16. 2016 results included a slow start to the year for U.S. markets and lower average daily values for international equity markets throughout the year. We also saw client redemptions in hedge fund business and other unfavorable asset mix changes. Despite these headwinds, full year 2016 EPS increased approximately 8% and ROE increased to 11.1%. This includes the impact of the fourth quarter notable items. Excluding the 4Q '16 expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash incentive compensation and the 4Q '16 tax benefits, 2016 full year EPS increased 5% and ROE increased slightly. Our 2016 pretax margin of 27.1% decreased relative to 2015. Nevertheless excluding the 4Q '16 expense associated with the acceleration deferred cash incentive compensation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management business, the 2016 pretax margin increased approximately 60 basis points to 29.7%. Turning now 4Q '16, EPS of a $1.48 increased from $1.21 in the year ago quarter and increased from a $1.35 in 3Q '16. As I mentioned earlier 4Q '16 EPS includes a net $0.13 benefit associated with the notable items. On the capital front in 4Q '16, we declared a common stock dividend of $0.38 per share and purchase $325 million of our common stock. Moving to Slide 9, we've got the highlight that excluding the expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash awards and the impact of the acquired GE business, we demonstrated continued progress in managing expenses for full year 2016, resulting in 51 basis points of positive fee operating leverage. Please turn to Slide 10 and 11, and I'll briefly review 4Q '16 operating basis fee revenue. Compared to 4Q '15, the stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted operating basis fee revenue with a corresponding benefit to total expense of $27 million. On a constant currency basis and excluding the impact associated with the acquired GE business, 4Q '16 fee revenues increased by approximately 4% relative to 4Q '15. Specifically servicing fees increased reflecting new business across our servicing lines, partially offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, client redemptions in the hedge fund business and the non-favorable asset mix change. Servicing fees decreased from 3Q '16 primarily reflecting the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, as new business was approximately offset by hedge fund out loads and an unfavorable asset mix change. Management fees increased from 4Q '15 and excluding the impact of currency translation and the acquired GE business, management fees were up $2 million or 8% primary driven by the elimination of money market fee waivers, higher equity markets and strong ETF flows partially offset by outflows in cash and sovereign funds. Foreign exchange creating revenue increased from 4Q '15 and 3Q '16 reflecting higher volatility and client related volumes. Securities finance revenue increased from 4Q '15 primarily reflecting growth in enhanced custody partially offset by lower agency revenue. Processing fees and other revenue decreased from 4Q '15 and 3Q '16 reflecting unfavorable valuation adjustments, which include the unfavorable impact of higher FX swap cost and lower revenue from joint ventures, partially offset by higher revenue associated with tax advantaged investments. Moving to Slide 12, net interest revenue increased from 4Q '15 primarily reflecting higher market interest rates in the U.S., higher than normal discrete security prepayments of approximately $8 million and disciplined liability pricing. Now turn to Slide 13 to review 4Q '16 operating basis expenses. Notably expense control continued in 4Q '16, excluding the expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash incentive compensation, total expense decreased from 3Q '16, compared to the year ago quarter and excluding the expense associated with the acceleration of deferred cash incentive compensation and the GE acquisition, expenses increased less than 1% primarily reflecting strong progress on State Street Beacon effective management of our other operating expenses and the benefit of the U.S. dollar. Let me now move to Slide 15 to review our capital highlights. Our capital ratios remained strong which has enabled us to deliver on a key priority of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. Compared to September 30th, our common equity Tier 1 ratio decreased under the fully faced in standardized and advanced approach, primarily driven by a decrease in the after-tax, unrealized mark-to-market position within the AFS investment portfolio due to higher interest rates as well as reduction in the FX translation due to the stronger U.S. dollar. The December 31th fully faced in supplementary leverage ratio at the corporation and the bank also decreased driven by a lower after-tax unrealized mark-to-market position within the AFS investment portfolio. Now coming briefly on the final TLAC rule that was issued in December become effective 1/1/19. The final rule was largely in line with our prior expectations. Based on the external long-term debt requirements linked to our SLR, we currently estimate that we will need to issue incremental qualifying debt of approximately $2 billion. Moving onto the next slide which we provide an update to our recently completed acquisition of GE Asset Management, the acquired GE Asset Management operations continue to support our plan to allocate capital to higher growth in return businesses. In 4Q '16, these operations contributed $64 million in estimated operating basis revenue and 58 million in estimated operating basis expenses, excluding merger and integration expenses and financing costs. We continue to expect the acquisition to be accretive to operating basis EPS and for revenue to exceed $270 million for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2016. Importantly, as the integration progresses, we expect further revenue growth and expense synergies in the first half of 2017. Moving to Slide 17, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. In 2017, we remained focused on key priorities for returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and executing on State Street Beacon as well as driving growth in our core franchise by delivering solutions to our clients. Importantly in 2017, we're targeting positive fee operating leverage of 100 to 200 basis points. Supporting this target, we expect operating basis fee revenue to grow by 4% to 6% and would increase our expected 2017 net State Street Beacon operating basis savings to $140 million. Turning to net interest revenue, we've developed two scenarios for 2017 operating basis NIR. The first scenario assumes market interest rates to remain at December 31 levels. Under this scenario, we expect operating basis NIR to be in the range of approximately $2.2 billion to $2.23 billion. The second scenario assumes U.S. central bank hikes for 25 basis points in both March and September. Under this scenario, we expect full year 2017 operating basis NIR to be in the range of $2.27 billion and $2.3 billion. Notably 2017 NIR will also be impacted by the level of deposits, the deposits swap to U.S. dollars and the associated expense will depend on further potential interest rate diversions between the respective currencies that we swapped. We currently expect our operating basis tax rate to be 30% to 32%, which does not assume any potential tax law changes due to the high level of uncertainty. Let me briefly touch on 1Q '17 before turning to the last slide. While our first quarter 2017 revenue will be impacted by market conditions, we expect to generate positive fee operating leverage relative to 1Q '16 supported by our continued focus on expense management. Also it's important to highlight that is in prior years, 1Q '17 compensation and employee benefits expense will be seasonally higher through the effect of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement eligible employees as well as for payroll taxes and associated benefits. We expect the incremental amount attributable to equity compensation for retirement eligible employees and payroll taxes in 1Q '17 to be in a range of $150 million to a $160 million compared to 122 million in 1Q '16. Moving to the last slide let me briefly review our 2017 balance sheet and capital outlook. We expect the balance sheet to modestly decline in 2017, driven by lower client deposits and lower wholesale CD levels, with the corresponding decrease in the average earning assets of approximately 0% to 5% compared to the 4Q '16 average earning asset levels. On the capital front, we have approximately $750 million remaining under our June 2016 common stock purchase program, and evolving regulatory and liquidity expectation mainly the issuances of both preferred shares and long-term debt in 2017. In summary, despite the environmental headwinds that we've experienced, we're pleased with 4Q '16 and full year 2016 results, and believe we're well position to achieve our 2017 financial objectives. Now, let me turn the call back over to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Thanks Mike. Victoria that ends our prepared remarks, and we're now looking for to have you open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Just a couple of clarification questions on the Blackrock piece of business. From what I understand, it was put up for RFP which to me means that you had a battle in your mind with, how do you think about the sending pretax margins versus retaining the business? So I didn't know if there is something you could tell us about the average fee rate for this business, I'm assuming it's lower because it\u2019s a $1 trillion book. And if there is anything you make about the common trust fund that would be the piece of business that would get move? Joseph Hooley : Yes, let me just give you additional color on that Glenn, and I'll just wind back a little bit. Blackrock has been a client of State Streets from the very beginning 1988. Their first funds and we've been fortunate to be joined at the hip with them through this successful journey of asset growth, and we think we've contributed somewhat to their success, both ETF and otherwise. You know as they grew got to 5.5 trillion in assets, they came to us and say that they needed to consider some diversification, which while not our first choice we appreciate where they were coming from. So, the common trust funds are like mutual funds under a bank structure, there is nothing terribly special about them. We had a relationship that considered that had custody and fund accounting associated with us with it. They told us they were going to move it to another provider, which I say well disappointed we appreciated where they were coming from. It's probably taken the year and half to do that. So they will do that over the course of the next year and half. Importantly, we continue to be Blackrock service provider in their high growth ETF business, and we have a significant global relationship with Blackrock. So, I view it as a kind of a one-off adjustment for Blackrock to get better diversified, we're pleased and thrilled with the Blackrock relationship. I think it will continue to grow, and we will grow with it. The other point that I was make which is I think an important point is that, in no way do I think it represents anything close to our trend. In fact, the trend is actually than the other way, which is we actually announced this morning the expansion of the Allianz Global Investors relationship, which spans Europe, Asia-Pacific; and in the past year as we have announced several deals MetLife, Watson Capital, PIMCO Russell. So, the overwhelming trend in the industry is to consolidate with fewer providers. For reasons of cost, it's more expensive for an asset manger to deal with multiple counter parties. And probably even more importantly, the need to extract data for investment management compliance and risk management, and the more counter price you have them all complicated that is. So, I would say in some, we're thrilled to be associated with the firm as successful as Blackrock, one of the consequences of that is when they grow so rapidly over a long period of time, they have chosen to make allocation adjustment of their service providers. We support that and we will make sure that the transition goes well. We think Blackrock will continue to grow us and by no means do I view it as a trend more as a one-off situation. Glenn Schorr : I definitely appreciate all that. If we step outside the Blackrock piece, and if we were just talking about the quarter, I think probably the next question I would probably ask it would be some version of assets under custody of six but core servicing fees up too. Is there anything unique in the quarter from market movements to show? Or is there just -- that\u2019s just natural fee compression that the business has been doing from last 20 years? Joseph Hooley : Yes, I would say, let me just explain it little bit and again I'll broaden it out past the quarter. I think, if you look at the quarter the things that were positive would be equity markets and new business. The things that slow the other way would be Mike mentioned, it's the strong U.S. dollar and the downward pressure in international markets particularly emerging markets. So, those are the market effects. The other effects Glenn, which we continue to bring up, but the important is the way money flows within our client and subsequently with us, and you see inflows out of the emerging markets out of hedge funds. Now, I believe that both of those they are cyclical trends and that we will see some reversion in both of those. And in the other flow trend which is more secular in my mind is the flow to ETF, and you have seen in the U.S. the stunning outflows to fund, inflows to ETF, we serviced over 60% of the ETF market. So, net-net that\u2019s a positive for us, but it's at a low fee rate. So, when you put all those things together, on the quarter you saw that numbers that you have suggested, but I'd also ask you to widen the lens and look over the past two or three years. And if you look at, service fees as a percentage of AUCA has remained pretty consistent at 1.83, 1.84, so I think the -- if you look at the consistency overtime, all of them mix shifts and the effects of the environment, most of which I described, which leads need to the focus on profitability, both at a firm level and at a client level. So, I think that is, that\u2019s how we focus, we can't control the environment, nor can we control the flows. But I think we've been smart about migrating our business to the alternative and also the servicing of the ETF's. So, we think we capture all the buckets, but they will move around in time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I wanted to ask on the cost side to your comments about the living in fee operating leverage in 2017. Just trying to understand, Mike your opening comments about, how this view change in the compensation plan works through that in terms of seemly adding to the underlying growth rate in 2017 because of that change? So, I guess if you kind to try to help us understand just the moving parts underneath that. There is the FX translation. There is the ads from GE. There is the 140, and then there is some level of underlying inflation. Anyway of this understanding kind of what's happening underneath of surface would be really helpful? Thanks. Mike Bell : Okay. So, Ken, good morning. First, in terms of the compensation change, I think importantly Ken, we don\u2019t expect there to be a net impact in 2017 from the compensation change that the Jay and I talked about here this morning. So, the reason for that is that we expect in 2017 to increase our cash mix of incentive comp that would then be payable in February '18, but would be accrued as an expense throughout 2017. And we expect net increase in that cash incentive comp mix, which is really driven by this stiff competition that we're dealing with in terms of competing for up for talent. We would expect that to be approximately offset by the lower amortization expense in 2017 from accelerating the expense of these cash, deferred cash incentive awards into 4Q '16. So, the net-net, we would expect that change to be approximately flat in terms of the full year impact on 2017. In terms of your question on other ads and reductions to comp, I think you talked about the main once that I would highlight. First of all obviously, we acquired the GE business, July 1, so next year we got a full year worth of expense there, and you can see from our disclosers the expenses associated with the acquired operations. In addition, we've been adding a significant amount of new business obviously that comes with revenue, but it also there is a cost to service that new business would expect that to be in and in 2017. We do expect that the there will be additional investments, not just in project Beacon, but also investments to support the long-term growth of the business. And we're focused on long-term shareholder value, not just the results for 2017. And as you quickly pointed out, we expect the net savings from Beacon to reduce that where significantly we expect a 140 million of net savings from Beacon in 2017. So the bottom line, Ken, without trying to focus precisely on the exact expense growth for the full year, what we're really riveted on is that 100 basis points to 200 basis points of positive fee operating leverage. Because again, we are going to have some wins, we expect that to add derivative growth, we need to service that. But basically what we're really riveted on is creating another year of positive fee operating leverage that is actually higher than what we did in 2016. And that puts us on that trajectory to get to the 31% pretax profit margin for 2018. Ken Usdin : Then just as the second question on capital pretty big movement in the unrealized gains and losses from the movement in rates, and you've mentioned perhaps you need to issue prefers. I just want to ask, where is your comfort zone and where you want to sit on your access to capital ratios whether it's CET 1 Tier 1 leverage SLR? And would any changes in rates potentially way on the amount of capital return you would ask for as a result? Mike Bell : First, I would point out that our capital ratios remain quite strong as we have wrapped up the year. First, looking at CET 1, you can see that we ended well above our 10% long-term target, and for the bank SLR are fully faced in the basis, we remain above the 6% bank SLR. Now, Ken, one of the reasons that we have had cushion in our targets, so one of the reasons that we have had a target of 10% for CET 1 is to deal with the kind of short-term volatility that we saw in Q4. Both the mark-to-market hit from the higher interest rates, but also the hit to the CET 1 ratio from the stronger U.S. dollar, and that\u2019s exactly the reason that we have a cushion is to deal with that kind of short-term volatilities. So, the bottom line is we are comfortable with our spot rate capital ratios here, as we wrap the year. I think that the big uncertainty is around the fed stress test. We don\u2019t have the scenarios yet. So, we obviously don\u2019t know, but I would expect that based on prior years that fed stress test will probably end up being our binding constraint. And depending upon exactly what that stress test looks like, press would be part of the overall menu of options that we would look at for 2017. But I think it's way too early to speculate on what we might issue, and also how that would come into play with the capital return to common shareholders that we would also look at as part of that capital plan submission. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I just want a follow-up on Ken's question on comp. So could you let us know my guess is that for the nearly 250 to 249 deferral charge that the majority just given the way usually those deferral profiles look the majority would have been hitting in '17? And so, could you conform that\u2019s right, and if it's possible maybe quantify for us? And also are you removing all of the continued service requirements for the employee process that you led out? And does that raise any concerns? And then, I don\u2019t hear a lot about competition for talent increasing, so could you may be square that with some of your comments and concerns about retention? Mike Bell : Sure, so good morning Brennan, it's Mike. I'll start and see if Jay wants to add. First on your numerical question, the 249 million would have been amortized over three years. So, we're being amortized over '17, '18 and in '19. But you're absolutely right, because these are awards that we're originally granted '14, '15 and '16. There is a disproportion impact on that 2017 of that 249 million that gets accelerated. So, whether or not get a precise numbers, but round numbers if you think about it as in the ballpark of 50% of that number, you wouldn't be far off. And so basically think of it as, those expense savings for 2017 by not having the amortization expense, we expect to be approximately offset by accruing throughout 2017 for a higher cash mix for the cash awards that will then be paid out in February 2018 based on our performance in 2017. So, that\u2019s why I say net-net, I don\u2019t expect there to be much of an impact in 2017 from the change. Obviously, when you get to the outer years, ultimately, there would be expense savings because the awards that will be issuing in February of 2018, and particular we'll have less deferred more cash, so therefore less expense ultimately in the outer years, but probably no impact in 2017. All on your question on the continued service requirements, importantly, Brennan, a couple of things, first this only applies to the deferred cash awards. It is not applied to the deferred equity awards that have been issued previously. And the deferred equity awards, it's obviously different for different people but tend to be higher, quite a bit higher actually than the deferred cash. So, no, we're not concerned about that having a significant impact on employee turnover. As a result of that is the equity award that people would be walking away from remain quite significant. And I would also would add that the, this doesn't have any impact to our Executive Vice President populations, so the top call it 70 people are not impacted by any of this, it's that pieces is carved out. And then lastly in terms of your point on talent, we continue to see stiff competition for top talent, which is really why we concluded. We needed to make this change now. What's happened Brennan is, we've become a competitive outlier here as the market has basically shifted to a higher percentage of cash over the last several years. So, our mix became an outlier and basically we concluded that this is the time to make that change. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that\u2019s all really helpful color Mike. Hopefully, the trends in competition for talent and trust banks are going to plead over to investment banks here soon. The other question would be on your interest rate guidance. So, very helpful that you laid that that up for us, thank you. If we do end up giving, getting maybe three hikes instead of the two in your upside scenario, how should we think about that impacting NII? My guess would be it would be a little bit less than addition from the midpoint, using the midpoint as a guide, just given beta and a shift higher to higher betas on your deposit base as we higher in rates. Is that right or should we think about it differently? Mike Bell : I think that\u2019s very fair Brennan. The first rate increase that little over a year ago now accrued very highly to our benefit, this last hike in December as well as the first hike in, actually the first two hikes in 2017. We expect to be pretty significantly accretive to us, but we do expect as rates rise and ideally ultimately get back to more like long-term averages that more of that would be shared in terms of higher liability pricing, but that it would be still be net-net accretive to us. So, your specific question on the third hike in 2017 obviously would largely depend upon the timing of that hike. But I think about it is round numbers that could be another 10 million to 15 million per quarter, depending upon exactly the timing of that third hike versus the other two. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe we could talk little bit about the tax rate going forward it's just a lot of moving parts sticking with all the tax credits and with the contemplation of tax reform? How do we think that I guess first your GAAP tax rate including the credits on go forward basis? And how do you think about the risk of losing those credits versus where the tax rate goes? That would be helpful. Mike Bell : Good morning, it's Mike. First, there is tremendous mean really substantial uncertainty around where all these tax law changes are going. And I think importantly Jim, it's the details rather than the headlines they were going to be very important. So, just as a couple of examples, it's particularly unclear at this point how potential changes would apply to financial services company. Talk about border tax or lack of deduction for interest expense in those. This kind of things is very unclear what that would be in terms of financial services firms in particular. So, at this point I really wouldn\u2019t speculate on the broader picture. In terms of your specific question around tax invasion investments, again the devil will be in the details. It is possible that the tax invasion that since we have had a lot of successful over the last several years, become incrementally less valuable in tax rate environment or in environment where there is less tax credits for the alternative energy in particular. I feel positive that the existing investments that we have do have contractual protections to protect in terms of near term cash flow, but again I think this is uncertain situation and really there will be a lot of devil in that details as proposals when we get flushed out. Jim Mitchell : And how do we think about GAAP tax rate on a go forward basis? Mike Bell : Again, I just think it's completely speculated. It will depend upon the full\u2026 Jim Mitchell : Not excluding any tax changes, I mean just\u2026 Mike Bell : I would expect that the, again takeaway the onetime benefits that we saw in Q4, but borrowing any tax change I would model it similar to what we saw in 2016. Again importantly exclude the Q4 tax benefits that we singled out in the release and then my prepared remarks. Jim Mitchell : And then may be just one last, other question on the Blackrock follow-up. And is there a way to think about the fee rate of that? And I understand obviously you guys announce this morning about 450 billion, I think is that incremental wins? And I guess when we think about your guidance this year that inclusive of the Blackrock and the new win this morning. Just may be some further clarification would be great? Mike Bell : Sure, Jim, I'll start and see if Jay wants to add or add it. But the, first, we really don\u2019t get into details about specific client arrangements, just, that would be a very bad practice. But it is fair to conclude that Blackrock as well as the recent wins are anticipated in the 4% to 6% in the key operating leverage goals that we laid out for 2017. Importantly, as Jay indicated, we don\u2019t expect Blackrock to have a material effect into a beginning in the second half of 2017. So, as Jay said, this is going to spill into 2018 as well. So, we expect that to take awhile to get picked up in run rate. Joseph Hooley : Yes, Jim. The only think I would add is that, in the same way we talked about the stickiness of this business when somebody exits. It takes a fairly protracted period at time and so the effect on revenue will phase in over, my guess is the year and half or so. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Just picking up on the last question, so just need another clarification, I guess around Blackrock. Will you guys win a sizable mandate obviously it often comes with a lot of expense associated with it? So we can take a guess on our revenue impact, but is there any expense relived that you could get on the back of that $1 trillion leaving? Mike Bell : Sure, I think the good news is that, as I mention, we booked $1 trillion for this year. We've got 440 billion that\u2019s still rolling in. These are resources that were redeploying, so I don\u2019t see much in the way stranded cost here given our expectation for continue growth. Is that way your question was Alex? Alex Blostein : Yes, just again like at the end of the day the people are trying to figure out the impact on earnings that is probably not fair to assume a 100% incremental margin on the loss revenue? Mike Bell : Correct, not at all. Alex Blostein : And then just shifting gears a bit back to the NIR discussion. So, I know you guys talked about the balance should be down about 0% to 5%. Is that again something that you're trying to do practically meaning shrink the size of the balance sheet? Or is that just kind what you generally expect with higher interest rates? And a clarification on $2 billion, I am assuming it's in the NIR guidance for 2017? Mike Bell : Let me answer the real easy one first. Yes, the TLAC is included in the NIR outlook, Alex that we talked about. On your question on the reduction in the balance sheet, it's really a combination of the two factors that you described. First of all, we do expect to further reduce wholesale CD balances in 2017, that\u2019s been part of our plan all along. So, I would -- I think that is on track and I would expect that to take round numbers 5 billion out of the balance sheet by the end of 2017. In addition, we do expect up to call a 10 billion of client deposits to come off, some of that we expect to come off naturally as the fed fund rate continues to increase, and they find alternative homes for that investment balance. But some of that is proactively looking to further reduce access deposits particularly in all the locations outside the U.S. and in particular EMEA would be an example where we are looking to further reduce access deposits. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : So assuming we're willing to accept your premise that the loss of the $1 trillion does not reflect a trend, it happens from time to time. You mentioned the 1.4 trillion of wins in 2016, you have a backlog. So, let's just accept that for this discussion, but still it raises the question, are you guys just in some ferocious price competition? I mean, did you lose this on price, I mean if this is the world's worst oligopoly? Is this just additional evidence of that? Mike Bell : No, I don\u2019t believe and you'd have to ask Blackrock, I guess. It is nearly a matter of us growing so big together and then having the need to introduce another supplier. Purest stuff was that I mean and I think that go to was the common trust funds, not the ETF. So, I think it was a rational move for them, and as I say not something we chose, but I understand their rational when you get to the 5.5 trillion. So, I would say it's much more reflective of the diversification strategy of Blackrock. Mike Mayo : I mean did you try to keep the business and it's not new that Blackrock is big I mean why now? Mike Bell : I think it's been an ongoing discussion with Blackrock on this point, and they chose this book of business to diversify and that\u2019s their call. Mike Mayo : And on Slide 17, when you give see guidance for 2017 of 4% to 6%, does that reflect the loss Blackrock business or would that be more of a 2018 impact? Mike Bell : I think it will phase in Mike. My guess is through the second half of '17, we will see a little bit and then in '18, we will continue to drift in. But so, yes, it certainly reflects any impact of Blackrock. Mike Mayo : And then last question, you continue to give targets for fee operating leverage, but not for operating leverage for the firm as a whole. Don\u2019t your clients pay you in compensating balances and which rates going up? Would you think about changing that target? Mike Bell : Yes, we came to that target just to isolate the net interest revenue from the things that we control. We certainly get paid in balances which create net interest revenue, and I think this year depending on the scenario you pick, net interest revenue might grow in line with core revenue. And therefore, we would transition over to something that looks like operating leverage generally. And if NIR is going more rapidly, we would expect the wider operating leverage target. Joseph Hooley : And Mike just to add to that I mean we continue to establish as an objective getting to a 31% pretax margin in 2018, obviously that\u2019s all in as well, so that is not changed from what the targets we communicated the year and half ago. Mike Mayo : And Mike Bell, just one last comment, it's your last call I guess. As you look back, what would you say, hey, this is really good accomplishment that you achieved? And what one thing that you didn\u2019t get done that you hope the firm gets done? Mike Bell : That\u2019s an interesting question. I would say that I feel best about the capital management discipline that we've had as an overall firm, but also applying at the business and the client level, Mike is what I feel best about. And I would say that in terms of work that still needs to get done that I'm sure that Eric will have a thoroughly enjoyable time dealing with the regulatory issues. I mean we still a have lot of wood to chop in that in that area. And we'd love to gotten all of that done before I left. I think that would still remain in chop. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Jay, just not to beat the dead horse on Blackrock here, but can you can talk about what you're still doing for Blackrock? Obviously through the iShares franchise whether that\u2019s intact I think that wasn't inherited from the deal in 2007? And if you can comment on any other types of business, and then clearly the mix shift with this, which shift more towards ETF and you've mentioned obviously that's a secular trend. Can you talk a little bit about the profit dynamics of service in ETF versus mutual funds? I understand its lower revenue, but what extent you put the offset in front? Mike Bell : Yes, happy to pick that up. As I mentioned, the Blackrock relationship is longstanding and significant, it's global and encompasses the ETF's, many of their mutual fund products and their institutional products all over the world. So, we cover most things. This common trust fund was a just one sleeve of that, but very comprehensive global. And also tightly integrated from a standpoint of back office some middle office integration with a lad and so, it's an extensive and valued relationship. With regard to the mix shift and as you rightly point out from package products in the way of fund into ETF, we do have a lower unit of revenue on an ETF, but profitability is quite similar to what you find in their traditional fund structure. Which is why you see a little bit of a, to my earlier comment, which is why, you see the service fee per AEU, CA having downward pressure, but shouldn't effect margin. And I guess the other point I would make is that, as in most of our businesses, the more scale you have, the more margin you should create. And so with the ETF business growing as rapidly as it is, and with thus invested in pretty significant and I would say differentiated technology, we would expect, we have ability to scale and improve that margin over time, as EPS grow, which we think they will continue too. Brian Bedell : Great, and then may be just on the guidance for the fees and expenses, the positive operating leverage. I see it sounds like you're saying that January market conditions are the basis for the fee outlook for 2017. But can you comment on, your view on hedge fund, redemption, I know you said that impacted the few rates in 4Q, so to what extent are you baking that in for coming in '17 and I know 4% to 6% guidance? Mike Bell : So, Brian, it's Mike. First, there are any number of factors that are going to impact a fee revenue growth in 2017, and so you are picking on the couple of them, but I mean there are whole host of other issues that we could talk about. I mean not the least of which is the mix shift that we saw in 2016 worked against us in terms of emerging markets versus developed markets. That\u2019s another wild card for 2017. But to answer your questions directly, yes, we were assuming that in that 4% to 6% range where market conditions are here in January obviously that means upside, if there is a continued grown up in the equity markets, downside if it doesn\u2019t. And in the hedge funds, it's difficult to project that beyond the near term. I mean in the near term we have continued to see pressure, and we thought about that in, as we develop the four to six. But as Jay indicated earlier, we expect that really to be more of a cyclical of phenomenon rather than a secular trend. So, over the long term, we would expect the mix impact that we had in 2016 to longer term ultimately reverse and to see more growth in emerging markets versus developed markets, and also additional growth in the hedge fund servicing business. Brian Bedell : Okay and then just mix of the 4% to 6% between the revenue lines, is that the 4% to 6% also a good assumption for the servicing fees? And then obviously the other ancillary in that range or is your big difference between those two? Mike Bell : I really can't go one by one. But I would point out that SSgA we expect additional growth because you need to annualize the GE Asset Management revenues. So that provides a discreet boost of between 1.5% and 2% to total full year fee revenue for 2017 versus 2016 just giving the additional six months of that. And so I would expect that the SSgA revenues would grow faster than the others. But I mean the trading environment is unclear. On finance, I think we will see continued growth in enhance custody but the market conditions around the agency business are really up unknown area of uncertainty. It will be what it would be but in aggregate we feel comfortable that 4% to 6% is fair enough work. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : I wanted to ask a little bit about in NII, and so when you are looking at the 6% increase from fourth quarter of '15 to fourth quarter '16 that only included really one rate hike. The static only has 1% to 3% growth over the next year which would also include an additional rate hike that we just got in last December. So, it seems like we are assuming that the deposit beta is runoff the deposits is accelerating pretty rapidly as you move just to the second rate hike versus what we have seen over the last year. So just I was wondering if you could reconcile those two and then looking at the 6% it looks still on the next rand of raising still a little conservative there? Mike Bell : Well, Marty, again, there are a lot of different factors that are going to coming to play here, a couple of specific data points; you might want to think about for your modeling. First of all, if you're new 4Q '16 is your starting point, I would strongly suggest that you take the 8 million of discreet prepayments out of there; we do not expect that to be the one rate of steady securities prepayments so to the course of 2017. So I think the 547 million in Q4 and back out the eight and you get the 539. And so if didn\u2019t look at the 539 compared to our static scenario, there is an up lift of $70 million that basically reflects the Q4, the December rate hike, that we all experienced. So would characterize that $70 million of accretion to be significant benefit and something that we're very pleased with and its driven by not just market conditions but the fact that we feel good, it will focused on the liability pricing actions as well, which makes that as accretive as it is. The other factor that I'd urge you to think about here is that, situation in Europe remains unhelpful and in particular the combination of the negative central bank rates, coupled with significant quantitative easing program, means that we continue to see a grind in net interest revenue for the non-U.S. dollar our portfolio. That\u2019s baked into the thinking for 2017 as well obviously it would look be a happier picture, if all we're focused on was U.S. Marty Mosby : And then, Jay, second question was, and always hit this Blackrock thing, couple different ways, but the only thing that I was curious about was given the all new initiative to be able to report on flows that you're seeing. Obviously not by customer but look at aggregate types of statistics. As Blackrock could be a large part of that aggregate, is this the versification in a sense of, foreseeing or real thinking about the new product that you have and then there is not wanting to be too big our reflection in that index? Joseph Hooley : Interesting question, Marty. No, I think that with 28ish trillion, the statistical, the need for data from a statistical reliability standpoint a $1 trillion wouldn't affect that one way the other. It always it in anyway and my discussions with Blackrock in there calculation, and I think everybody feels quite comfortable that we aggregate information that it's all masked and that we have more than enough to create statistical examples and Blackrock wouldn\u2019t effect that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : It's sounded like the sort of diversification initiative the Blackrock is undertaking, that sounded quite on unusual from what you were saying, it was not right as much more common, so someone could focus on just a single provider? Mike Bell : Very unusual, but it is also not a lot of $5.5 trillion around even. So, yes, unusual though. If you think about in my history here, it's quite unusual. Geoffrey Elliott : What give you comfort that if this partnership between Blackrock and JPMorgan turn out to be successful. You don\u2019t end up losing more Blackrock assets down the line. What can you tell us to give us some kind of their\u2026 Mike Bell : You could say that about any relationship and I would say we continue invest in the business, we as a specialty provider I would put us up against anybody anytime with regard to our back office middle office, digitization or global footprint, consistent systems. But having said that, we don\u2019t sit back so I referenced earlier Geoffrey the work we have done and the ETF platform. They are first continuing to invest to create the discernable differences and the eyes of the authorized participants and the clients. So we view it as our job to get better every day whether it's the way service to client the way we create new products the way we anticipate new demands from our clients and regulations so that\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what we worry about and think about and so I have all the confidence in the world that we will continue to be a value provider to Blackrock and all of the other clients. Geoffrey Elliott : And are there any particular points in time we should focus on as how long are those all the Blackrock assets going to be tied up with you before they come up again and someone else can compete for them? Mike Bell : No, you should be think about it at the point and time it's just like any other relationship that we have they have terms to them but at end of the day if you are providing value people have little reason not to continue to do business with you. Operator : The next question comes from the line Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, you talked about in the processing fees and other revenue line that there is an unfavorable valuation adjustment that affected the number and the number in quarter look like it was negative 65 million versus a positive to 111 million a year earlier. Can you share with us what was the valuation adjustment and how much was that? Mike Bell : Sure, Gerard. First of all, I would urge you to include the tax equivalent adjustment in there. So on operating basis of processing fees and other, on operating basis 121 million in the quarter, but what I was referencing the most significant of the adjustments in the quarter was we had approximately 20 million of unfavorable FX swap cost. So, this is the cost as an example, this would be the cost of converting deposits that we get in Europe over to U.S. dollars to be able to invest and here in the U.S. between the fed funds hike and the continued negative conditions in Europe, not to mention the quantitative easing that the European Central Bank has been doing. We have seen FX swap cost get more and more expensive then we saw in particular a lot of volatility in December around in the FX swap markets that further increased the cost of those swaps. And normally, we do get hedge accounting for that so normally that is a negative to net interest revenue, what we saw in the quarter is that we had fewer of those trades they qualified for hedge accounting with some very technical rules around exactly what it take to get hedge accounting. So as a result that ended up in other fee revenue. As I said that it was negative 20 million in the quarter. We had a couple of other things as well, we have these investments in various joint ventures, that was a negative outlier in the quarter that, run numbers about negative 9 million and it's firmly a small positive, so that was a headwind. And then we hit some other smaller valuation issues but so its, it was one of those that seemed like a little bit of a perfect storm depressing the other fees for the quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then as a follow-up, obviously, you guys always give us the color on the first quarter equity compensation expense that pops up as well as payroll taxes. I understand that it is a new accounting rules that they are going to put into place this year regarding the tax impact of share based compensation. Should we expect that impact to your numbers in 2017 due to the change in the accounting? Mike Bell : We don\u2019t expect that to be material Gerard. I mean obviously, it depends exactly on market conditions and what would happen to our stock, but we don\u2019t expect that they have a material impact. If it does, I'm sure Eric will talk about it in future quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I guess I have a quick question on the NIR this quarter may be not so much on the quarters is well but, what did you see for deposit of the quarter, what's the most recent hedge funds move and was there also any impacts from the European debt securities that you had said were causing margin pressure before? Mike Bell : Sure, Brian, it's Mike. First, I rather not give out the specifics on the deposit beta, but suffice to say that the majority of that debt funds hike us accrued to our benefit and that's -- sorry, it was accretive, not a huge amount in the quarter because it was so late in the quarter. But in terms of the benefit, in terms of full year 2017, that benefit is significant income and in terms of your question on Europe the circumstances there have not changed. The combination of the negative central bank balances at the negative central bank rates at the ECD coupled with the depressed credit spreads and continue to leave this in this position of this grind, its pushing down that interest revenue, obviously that\u2019s all impacted, that\u2019s all reflected in the expectations, the outlook that we gave you for full year 2017. We're not expecting that situation to get better over the course of 2017. So, it's really unchanged. Brian Kleinhanzl : And 'on your fee revenue growth assumptions, the 46% for 2017, think about it, I know you quite a think about it fee rates, direct from the fee rates, I mean if we were to think about it, do you assuming fee rates continue to decline, like you saw declines in asset management, as you say is they flat going forward? Mike Bell : As I said to one of the earlier questions, I mean there any host of things that could impact fee revenue in 2017. I really think about it Brian more as a mix issue as oppose to a fee rate issue in particular. Again, we don\u2019t believe that the cyclical mix change out of emerging markets in hedge funds in 2016 is a long-term secular trend. We think that will bounce back exactly when it does is unclear, but if that get improved then I would expect that to actually be a positive in terms of mix change. And so, it's contemplated as part of the range that we gave you the 4% to 6%. That it's there is a whole set of different scenarios that could place us a different spot in the range. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had just a question longer term on, how you are thinking about pricing for potential deals and it has to do with the fact that rates are rising? So the value with the soft dollars going up and the mix of revenues that you generated from your business activities, so I am wondering if that factor is into your thinking how you are thinking about CE growth as well? Joseph Hooley : I'll take that, Betsy. This is Jay. You are right and we hope that continues I think between rates and where you are going to see a little more action of foreign exchange side we have a lot of confidence in the growth of our enhanced custody so those revenue streams I think are probably tending in a good way. Some of those are more explosive and the conversation with the client with regard whether somebody is lending securities or doing a certain amount of trading. Some were settled and we try that consider all of it and looking at relationships overtime to make sure that they hurl certain profitability metrics for us. So it doesn\u2019t really changed it\u2019s a mix gets more healthy. We would hope as we pointed out in our guidance around margin that we are able to extract more margins in time. And that\u2019s a fact there are fee rates and also the Beacon driven efficiency. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately at your last Investor Day you talked and showed quite a bit around that data analytics keys of the offerings that you are investing in. Just wanted to get a sense of client response take up rate, ability to charge for that\u2019s part of the reason to pick you? Maybe just give us some color there? Joseph Hooley : Yes, now it's I believe you have heard me say this probably too many times that is the future of this place, and clients pay us to settle trades and to calculate net asset values but increasingly the value as expressed in terms of how we can aggregate data pull data together for inside to support any number of these which they have. We have at last count just I think its eight clients have hired us to do kind of a comprehensive aggregation of their data information of product we call data GX. That\u2019s kind of foundation of products or is to be extent that a big client hires us to be the overall integrator of that data. On the back of that we think there will be enormous analytics opportunities, not only with us but with others. So, I would say great progress on data GX. And the demand is increasing pretty rapidly as people come to grips whether it\u2019s a compliance service management need or the need to understand different aspects of their information from a standpoint of managing their portfolio for performance. So, I would say off to a good start I think I say after good start, I say competitively, we think we allocates long before our competitors and we're quite optimistic about the trends. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Jeff Harte : Just a couple for me. On the 2 billion of incremental qualifying debt to issue for TLAC, I want to make sure getting this right. Should we be expecting an absolute increase in debt or 2 billion in other some currently outstanding issuances as could be replace less more favorable outstanding debt from TLAC? Mike Bell : I do expect this Jeff to be incremental. Jeff Harte : And then I was looking for a silver lining with large transfers as a way of custody assets. I mean does that typically include termination payments or would there possibly some kind of short term revenue benefit from that larger outflow? Mike Bell : No, not really, I mean I appreciate the silver lining was back to but, I think that there is a silver lining for me as that Blackrock is growing in the way is that, we'll grow through this I suspect in a short period of time. Jeff Harte : Okay. And if I just been kind of on a bigger picture on the kind of importance of scale and servicing efficiency, I guess I might be getting at business mix as a servicing covers an awful lot of ground. But can you help differentiate for me State Street from kind of some of the other providers that also have significant scale? And why when we look at a profitability we think State Street is going to be may be come out ahead of some of those competitors? Joseph Hooley : Let me take that one Jeff, this is Jay. And I think that, if you look at the scale efficiencies in this business, they generally anchored around your core settlement and accounting activities, as well as some of the administration tax support. And you know the efficiency comes out of initially your technology architecture and philosophy, one versus many systems and then it grows out of, I would say about the next process layer which is how thoughtful have you been about creating global processes, how advanced are you with regard to creating global standards of excellence and then ultimately which is, what our pursuit is with Beacon is digitizing all that, so you reduce the level of labor by a client technology. And if that\u2019s the mental model of how you optimize the efficiency out of a big scale processing business, I would say, we\u2019re well ahead of most of the, if not all of the competitors from the stand point of our discipline of common systems, not a common systems but systems that we own and operate, so that we control. The first phase of our IT and Ops transformation was largely a process and center of excellence move and then this digitization. This last phase is all around optimizing the core and extracting the data for other revenue opportunities. And my visibility which is pretty good because this is the business we, and that were well ahead of our competitors, and I think that, if we continue invest at the right pace, I don\u2019t see anybody catching up with us. And the sooner we get to that state of fully digital being able to provide information in data upstream for our clients to me that\u2019s the real prize in this business. So, I don\u2019t think there is a magic formula for what to do, but I would say we are much further ahead in the execution of getting it done. Operator : There are currently no further questions. Mike Bell : Victoria thanks and for those who are still online thanks for your attention. We look forward to talking to about our first quarter results on April 26th. Thank you. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning and welcome to State Street Corporation's First Quarter of 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Today's discussion is being broadcast live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution, in whole or in part, without expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on State Street website. Now, I would like to introduce Anthony Ostler, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street. Anthony G. Ostler - State Street Corp.: Thanks, Hope. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first. Then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit your questions to two questions and then re-queue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating-basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measures are available in the appendix to our 1Q 2017 slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today, in our 1Q 2017 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements, and in our SEC filings including the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter 2017 results reflect our business momentum across asset servicing and asset management. Strong fee revenue growth coupled with expense control and good progress against our strategic priorities drove significant positive fee operating leverage. On an operating-basis, we increased return on equity by 200 basis points and our earnings per share by 23% from the first quarter last year. Our new business traction is solid, as we continue to invest in our technology and systems, benefiting customers and investors, and our pipeline remained strong. We continue to see strong trends for asset managers to consolidate providers as a way to create efficiencies and improve information needs. Recent mandates would support this trend. We believe State Street has the unique advantage of being able to service complex and global assets on an integrated service platform. This coupled with our investment in technology and digitizing our processes enables us to extract meaningful data and insights for our clients that they would be hard-pressed to obtain anywhere else. We see two other secular growth trends that play to our strengths. The shift towards passive investing is increasing business given our 55% plus share of ETF servicing, and the expansion of international asset managers with multijurisdictional offshore funds is buoying our international growth given our global capabilities. These advantages are illustrated by our 11% increase in assets under custody and administration versus the first quarter of 2016, reflecting strengthening markets, improved client flows and the contribution of our new business wins over the past year. As Eric will lay out for you in more detail, based on the strong start to 2017, our outlook has improved modestly from our January 2017 outlook and remains within our previously disclosed ranges. Turning to slide number four, I'll now review our progress on our strategic priorities and some key achievements this year. We continue to drive growth from our core franchise, with new asset servicing wins of approximately $110 billion for the quarter, reflecting mandates from clients around the world. In our total new business yet to be installed at quarter-end was approximately $375 billion, which is above typical levels over the past two years. We also saw continued momentum in SSGA's ETFs, driven by flows and improving equity markets. State Street Beacon continues to progress with further investments and adoption of our technologies. We're also engaging with our clients to co-create and prototype solutions to meet their needs. Examples include some of our key clients' global adoption of accounting technologies, enabling a 20 to 30-minute improvement in the end-of-day delivery of net asset valuations to clients' distributors. We also continue to make investments in innovative solutions to address client needs across regulatory requirements, risk and analytics. Some examples include our solutions to meet the SEC Modernization reporting and liquidity risk management rules. Our DataGX solution that provides tools and analytics on client and third-party data continues to gain traction from asset owners globally to support their evolving needs. We launched the distribution of the GX Private Equity Index to approximately 300 global asset management clients to enable them to improve benchmark analysis of private equity performance. We're developing and launching new analytical tools to enable clients to better manage environmental, social and governance exposures, as these investment strategies continue to gain traction and importance. And lastly, as we showed at an investor conference in February, we have launched a pilot mobile app for chief risk officers to manage their exposures real-time. Now let me talk about SSGA. SSGA finished the quarter with $2.56 trillion in assets under management, a 4% increase from fourth quarter 2016 and a 12% increase from 1Q 2016. The majority of the growth from 1Q 2016 was driven by market appreciation, with an additional 5% of growth in the acquired GE Asset Management business, which is performing very well. SSGA achieved strong revenue gains during the quarter, driven in part by the momentum of our ETF strategies, which are benefiting from investments in distribution and product development, such as the SSGA SHE ETF launched last year to help increase visibility of the importance of gender diversity across corporate boards and management. And we're delighted by the overwhelming response to Fearless Girl, which demonstrates the power of fulfilling this objective. We continue to make good progress in the integration of the acquired GE Asset Management business. Notably, for the first nine months, we've achieved accretive operating-basis earnings. In closing, we remain committed to expense control, as reflected by our 1Q 2017 positive fee operating leverage of approximately 570 basis points and total operating leverage of approximately 220 basis points from 1Q 2016. And in 1Q 2017, through share repurchase and common share dividends, we returned approximately $665 million of capital to common shareholders, which was $150 million ahead of schedule. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric Aboaf, who moved into the CFO role at the end of February. Eric will review our financial performance for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, after which we'll take your questions. Eric? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 5 where I'll start my review of our first quarter 2017 operating-basis results, which supplement our GAAP results. As you can see, we have made a conscious effort this quarter to narrow the differences. Operating-basis EPS for 1Q 2017 increased to $1.21 per share, up 23% from 1Q 2016, reflecting higher equity markets, new business wins, continued expense discipline, and fewer shares outstanding. 1Q 2017 results reflect strong fee revenue growth over 1Q 2016 in both asset servicing and asset management. At the same time, we carefully managed the expenses with the help of State Street Beacon, delivering over a 5.5 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage over 1Q 2016. This includes 2.3 percentage points from the sale of BFDS/IFDS and the GE Asset Management acquisition. Slide 5 also highlights a few notable items that impacted both GAAP and operating-basis results this quarter. First, we recorded an after-tax gain related to the sale of BFDS/IFDS of $31 million, or $0.08 per share, as we continue to focus increasingly on our core business. Second, we took the opportunity to tactically reposition a portion of the investment portfolio for the current rate environment, which will improve NII going forward. That cost $32 million after-tax, or $0.08 per share. Third, our first quarter results in both 2016 and 2017 included the seasonal effect of deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees. All-in-all, pre-tax margin was up 1.7 percentage points and ROE was up 2 percentage points to 10.4% as compared to 1Q 2016. Now let me turn to slide 6 to briefly review growth of two key drivers of our businesses. AUCA increased 11% from 1Q 2016, driven by market appreciation, higher inflows in the U.S. from asset managers and ETFs, partially offset by the continued rotation out of hedge funds. Notably, we also experienced strong growth in Europe relating to both onshore and offshore markets. As compared to 4Q 2016, AUCA also saw a good step-up, which positions us well for the rest of the year. Turning to State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 12% from 1Q 2016, driven by market appreciation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management operations, partially offset by some net outflows. We did see strong ETF inflows again, but we continued to expand our products array. Please turn to slide 7 where I'll review 1Q 2017 revenue compared to 1Q 2016. You'll also find detail in the appendix with a comparison to 4Q 2016. Servicing fees increased 4%, primarily due to higher equity markets and strong growth in net new business across the globe and across multiple client segments, partially offset by continued hedge fund outflows. As compared to 4Q 2016, we saw this momentum continuing. Management fees increased 41%, driven by the contribution of the acquired GE Asset Management business, higher equity markets and higher yielding ETF inflows. As compared to 4Q 2016, performance was strong as well. Trading services increased slightly relative to 1Q 2016 as a result of higher volumes in foreign exchange trading. Securities finance revenue decreased slightly from 1Q 2016, reflecting lower short-interest in equity markets during the quarter. Processing fees and other revenue increased primarily due to the BFDS sale and the absence of some FX swap costs. Please note that these FX swap costs are now in net interest income this quarter as they qualified for hedge accounting. Moving to slide 8, NIM was up 5 basis points from 1Q 2016. NII increased primarily reflecting higher market interest rates in the U.S. and disciplined liability pricing, partially offset by lower interest-earning asset and lower non-dollar investment portfolio yields. As compared to 4Q 2016, NIM was up 9 basis points, also due to higher rates and disciplined liability pricing, even after considering the additional FX swap costs now in interest expense. Now I'll turn to slide 9 to review expenses. 1Q 2017 expenses increased 6% in total from 1Q 2016, but half, or 3% of that, came from $51 million of GE Asset Management expenses. Compensation employee benefits is impacted in the first quarter of each year by seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees. Compared to 1Q 2016, the seasonal impact increased by $32 million, driven by a higher number of employees who fell within the retirement age window. Aside from this increase, we saw expected headwinds like annual merit increases, new business, onboarding costs, and technology investments, which were offset by savings from State Street Beacon. As compared to 4Q 2016, expenses were up only slightly, excluding this 1Q 2017 seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense and the 4Q 2016 acceleration of deferred cash awards. Let me now move to slide 10 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. But Beacon is also designed to enhance client solutions, reduce operational risk, and engage our teams throughout the enterprise. As Jay mentioned, we are striving towards a highly digitized environment, which has already been delivering tangible client benefits. Notably, Beacon is now driving innovation, such as our recently launched SEC Modernization products, which we expect can contribute to our top line revenue growth in the future. We're also mitigating risk and gaining efficiencies by automating controls and improving monitoring technology. And lastly, our Beacon program is now addressing opportunities across our enterprise. Our SSGA Beacon effort is focused on client experience, front-office optimization, and operational effectiveness, and we are tackling our corporate function costs as well. Now let's turn to slide 11 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, including an investment portfolio with a well-constructed and diversified mix of securities. As I mentioned earlier, during 1Q 2017, we had the opportunities to make some tactical adjustments given market trends. On the capital front, our position remains strong, and it remains a key priority to return capital through share repurchases and dividends. We retired $523 million of common stock this quarter, which includes our quarterly plan plus consideration received as part of the BFDS/IFDS sale. We have $227 million remaining under our June 2016 common stock purchase program. As expected, our supplementary leverage ratio increased as we tighten the size of our balance sheet. Moving to slide 12, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. With a strong start to 2017 in hand, we remain focused on achieving our 2017 outlook, which has improved modestly from our January projection. Our priorities continue to be : driving top line growth in our core franchise by delivering solutions to our clients, prudently managing expenses as we execute on State Street Beacon, and returning capital to shareholders. There are three areas that I would like to highlight in the outlook. First, we now expect our 2017 operating-basis fee revenue to be at the middle to higher end of the 4% to 6% growth range, assuming the favorable market conditions continue to prevail. Second, our NII outlook now assumes a rising rate scenario, which anticipates that the Fed increases again in September. We now expect full year 2017 operating-basis NII to be at the upper end of our original $2.27 billion to $2.3 billion range. That said, we are carefully watching long rates. And third, we now expect our operating-basis tax rate to be at the lower end of the 30% to 32% target we communicated in January. Let me briefly touch on the second quarter of 2017 before turning the call back to Jay. We expect momentum in servicing fees to continue in 2Q 2017, driven by client flows and net new business. We expect trading services activity to continue to be muted, while expecting a seasonal uptick in securities finance. Neither the BFDS gain in fees nor the securities repositioning are expected to repeat. NIM should be up in the mid single-digits with the balance sheet down slightly, resulting in an increase in NII of several percent. In summary, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve our full year 2017 financial objectives. Now, let me turn the call back to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Thanks, Eric. Our long-term growth is being fueled by State Street Beacon and the way ahead. And after 225 years, we can step back and see what has made us successful. It's been our people, technology, insights, and experience combining to create enhanced asset intelligence for our clients. Our future success will be driven by these strengths and our ability to further differentiate ourselves by transforming the way data is utilized to provide additional capabilities to our global client base. Now, Hope, I'd like to open the call to investor questions. Operator : Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to see if you could help us understand some of that push and pull between NII and the processing other. Eric, you didn't mention it in your forward commentary, so can you just walk us through, does that elevated processing and other result, ex the $30 million gain, now stay and then we see the direction change in NII? Or maybe you could just help us through understand that dynamic and what happens from here? Thanks. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Sure, Ken, it's Eric. Let me just take you through it so that you've got a good visibility. I think what you've seen us do this quarter as we designated the bulk of the FX swap activity that we've been doing for a number of quarters and years as economic hedges against the deposits. And as a result, those FX swap costs now sit in NII as opposed to in processing fees. I think that's a kind of \u2013 it's a natural way to report our NII and NIM. And our expectation is we'll continue to do that going forward and reflect them along those lines. I think if you're just looking for the numbers, I'm happy to share those with you. On a year-over-year basis, the swing was about 3 bps. On a quarter-over-quarter, it was about 5 bps. And now I think we've got a good path going forward. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : And just to confirm then, how do we think about that processing and other line, given \u2013 I think you mentioned lower energy credits and that's got some seasonality in it. So if we start at $152 million (20:30), is that now where we go from here? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: I think the \u2013 you really have to do two things on the processing and other line, which always have some volatility in it, right? One is you've got to take out the BFDS/IFDS gain, right? And then secondly, you've got to remove the 5 basis points worth of swap costs. That was about $25 million on the science (21:01) of our balance sheet and use that as the new baseline. I will remind you, there's always some volatility in that line, plus/minus some. So just keep an eye on that and look back over the past, I think it will give you a bit of an indication. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And if I could just ask one more just on the BlackRock you had \u2013 Jay had mentioned last quarter that he'd expected it to start to roll out in the second half. Can you just update us on timing of that? Is that still incorporated in your guidance and if it's changed at all? Thanks. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Sure, Ken. This is Jay. Happy to do that. The BlackRock transition will occur beginning in 2018, not 2017, and is likely to take several quarters to be completed. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Hi. How are you? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Good morning. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Question on deposit beta. I mean, it looks a little higher than what we've seen at some of the other companies. I'm just curious, is that just a function of client franchise and how you want to roll, or is there anything contractual that goes towards how the higher rates flow through on the liability side? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Glenn, it's Eric. Let me take that. The client beta is you have to actually \u2013 you have to look carefully at the average interest-earning schedule to decipher. This quarter, they were in the 20% to 25% range, which is I think what we've seen towards the start of a rate cycle in the past what we saw a year ago. The way to extract them from that average earning schedule is to take a look at the U.S. deposit costs, U.S. interest-bearing costs. You saw those nudge up about 6 basis points quarter-over-quarter, right, relative to a 25 basis point hike by the Fed. If you also look down at the total interest-bearing or the non-U.S. interest-bearing deposit costs, just remember, the swap costs affect that line, and so there'll be some noise there that you just have to account for. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : I got that. Okay. And, I guess, this is an ongoing question. The revenue growth targets are obviously still in the 8% to 12% range. I think they were maybe 5% ex-GE, but the fees were better. It's more like 8%. But any way slice it, I think fees grow a little less than assets. Do you think of that as just like that's the world we live in, there's some fee compression, there's some mix shift, and we make it up on volume and give the operating leverage, they'll be happy. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: I think there is a fair number of themes you just covered in a short sentence, but I think you've got the gist of it. I think what you'll find is, as asset values increase, right \u2013 they were up, asset values year-over-year against our mix of equity and fixed income and all were up about 10%, for example \u2013 you'll naturally see just because of the denominator effect, the fee rate flowed down. So I think that's just part of the dynamic of the math, and then that's further impacted by mix. I think you are right, though. If you think about the buildup of revenue growth in an asset servicing business, it starts from how much asset appreciation do you expect year-over-year, right, and we've got the last 10, 20, 30 years to look at. You think about flows, right. Are you servicing asset managers who are bringing inflows as opposed to seeing net outflows. So that matters. You then add net new business, right. Are you gaining a point of market share or 2 points, like what the \u2013 how effective are you doing that. And, obviously, one of the reasons for that Beacon investment and the technology and the sophistication in the global offering we add is to push that in the right direction. There is always a little bit of pricing headwind. I think there is a little bit of pricing headwind in this business and every business that one operates in, but that's got to be made up. And then there is foreign exchange swings up and down. So those are kind of the \u2013 that's the algebra that I think we think about and, obviously, a number of those we can control. And that's how we're focused. Glenn Schorr - Evercore ISI : Awesome. Thanks, Eric. Appreciate it. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to follow up on the question on deposit beta. So I appreciate what we've seen here so far. How are you feeling, though, on a go-forward basis? What's your sense for the gamma on the beta, so to speak? In other words, how should we think about trajectory of beta from here? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: I still remember that you asked about the gamma on beta. I think that's the second derivative, if I remember properly from my calculus days. I think it's a fair question. Betas have been relatively low by past historical standards. We saw 20% to 25% this quarter. We saw about that a year ago, though, it's hard to always calibrate the very first uptick. We expect this level again in second quarter, right, at least within that range, given what we see so far. I think what happens after that is the broader question \u2013 what happens if there is a hike in September, what happens with hikes next year \u2013 because we all know that betas for past cycles are in the 50%, 60% range. And the question is \u2013 will those repeat themselves and, if so, when. Obviously, the environment has changed, right? The money market fund and offering is weaker than it's been before, so that could be a positive for banks when you think about betas. On the other hand, there are always pressures the other way. So we'll see. But so far, we've seen I think healthy betas and kind of a good balance, and we expect that to play out for the next hike or two. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : And sorry about the gamma there. I'm certainly \u2013 I talk too much to derivative traders, I guess. So, to paraphrase, you don't think there is going to be a significant change in the beta, albeit maybe a natural ramp, is that fair? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah, that's fair. Given what we know today, I think that's our current expectation. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Terrific, terrific. Thank you very much. And then just curious if you could give some color on the outflows with the institutional business? What is it that you think is driving that? And maybe what adjustments you guys are looking to make to slow that trend? And your thoughts on the ETF flows versus maybe some of the large competitors that showed really pretty remarkable flow trends on the back of some price reductions? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yeah, let me start that one, Brennan, and I'll invite Eric to jump in. A two-parter (28:51) question on the institutional outflows this quarter, it kind of continues the trend of mostly passive, largely equity, a little bit of sovereign wealth, but just general repositioning as well as a little bit of currency overlay also affected that institutional outflow. So that's a story that is an ongoing story. I think probably the better part of the story is the ETF flows, which were $12 billion net in the first quarter and were largely made up of sector funds SPY, which is the S&P 500, and we had good growth from EMEA. And I'd just remind you, a quarter is a quarter. But if you look over the past three quarters, our net flows were $12 billion in the first quarter, $36 billion in the fourth quarter, and $12 billion in the third quarter. So I think trends are important here, and we feel pretty good about the investments that we've made in the ETF franchise, both in product and distribution. And I would suggest that those investments are paying off, and we're seeing that. So we feel pretty good about the ETF positioning. Do you want to add anything? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah, Brennan, I'd just add that from a financial standpoint, the outflows here were in very thin margin passive strategies. I think our overall fee rate in SSGA is about 6 basis points or so. These were a good bit below those. So there's always a bit of question when you have competitive bidding and so forth, as you want to keep low fee, low margin business. And you can imagine we also need to be a little bit disciplined there. I think the important news is that the inflows that came in with that ETF franchise are above those rates. And so in a way, we had a revenue uptick. And if you want to step back, asset under management \u2013 assets under management in the business were up 4% sequentially, revenue was up 6%. Why? Because we're actually trading up as part of our business expansion here. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Perfect. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, Jay, good morning. Eric, good morning. A question for you guys \u2013 well, Eric, really for you on the balance sheet strategy. So the leverage ratio is in a pretty good place now. The size of the balance sheet came down quite meaningfully sequentially, and I think it kind of jives with your earlier comments that you kind of expect 5-ish percent I think decline for the full year. So I guess, A, should we take that as the balance sheet should be stable from now on? And, B, as you think about any other repositioning or securities remix (31:47) that you guys are thinking about on the balance sheet side just between the securities portfolio? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Sure. Let me start with the balance sheet side. I think you did see us bring it down consciously. The background there is, as you know, as a company, we began to tackle the size of the balance sheet almost two years ago now. I think we've done quite good work there. Second half last year, with some of the large inflows that we had disclosed (32:18) on the asset servicing side, those came with deposits, right, and so deposits started to float up. It took the size of our balance sheet up. And what you saw us do is effectively make sure that we digested those, some of those we cap. And then under the surface, you saw us do some optimization, right? We rolled down some of our treasury CD portfolio, that's down over two quarters by about $5 billion, $6 billion. So we're taking out some of the higher cost deposits as we manage and keep the balance sheet tight. Going forward, I think you're right. I think it's going to be flattish, maybe down a little bit, maybe flat. You never really know with our client inflows and outflows, so I want to be careful there. But I think we're comfortable with the step reduction that we took. And going forward, it will be a little more on the business-as-usual side. On the securities portfolio, that's exactly right. I think we saw an opportunity. We moved just a few billion out of our $100 billion of securities, and we feel pretty confident where we are, so we don't expect further adjustments in the near future. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then the second question. Jay, I think this one's for you. Just on the $375 billion of new business that's yet to be installed, any (33:45) fees associated with that? Or at least kind of, how does the fee rate on that book of business yet to be installed compares to your sort of overall blended fee rate on the installed business? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yes, let me pick that one up, Alex. What I can tell you is that it is a little bit elevated, and it's elevated because the deals that we've been booking the last couple of quarters tend to be meatier, more complex deals, which you can infer from that higher-ish fee rates because it's back office, middle office. And, therefore, the chunkiness causes extended implementation lifecycle. So, I guess that's what I'd say about that. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. All right. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Morning, folks. Eric, can you just talk about the assumptions that you have for the 4% to 6% fee growth in terms of market returns from, let's say, the end of the first quarter? And also FX volatility, I think that was still getting pressured here in April. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah. I think the assumptions are in line with what we disclosed back in January. We're expecting several percentage point increase in underlying equity markets, I think, in line with general economic forecast. FX was kind of at the level of where we were in January. The only large swing we've seen so far is the British pound. So just \u2013 but that's a piece, not a large piece, but obviously a piece of our European revenues. So not a large swing there. So I'd sort of summarize as basic economic assumptions that you or we or others would have out there. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. And then, just to focus back on the balance sheet. You did mention you're keeping your eye on yield curve flattening. Can you give us a sense of some sensitivity to your 2017 net interest revenue outlook on that? And then also, if you can talk about the repurchase strategy that I think helped. It looks like to me the repo line was up about $12 million sequentially. I'm not sure if it was all due to that, how recurring do you think that could be? And then, any premium amortization decline in the quarter as well? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: All right. Let me just try to take through those \u2013 all fair questions. The back-end sensitivity, I think the best way to frame it is, we have that interest rate NII disclosure for 100 basis points up/down in our K. We also have the ramp, but the shock is probably the easiest one to talk through. If you remember, about 60% of our interest rate sensitivity is in the dollar book, the balance is in Europe. And then, of the dollar book sensitivity impact, the overall \u2013 about 80% of our sensitivity is at the front-end, about 20% at the back-end of the curve. So, I think it's the front-end rate hikes from the Fed that matter the most. But I think what you will see is, had rates stayed up in the 2.50%, 2.60%, 2.70% (37:15) range in the U.S. and U.S. markets, then that would have created a tailwind of NII for most bank portfolios, just given where they have been purchased at in the last few years. I think without that, you won't have a natural tailwind and so you can't count on that. And so, it's not a huge mover, but it's the kind of thing that we want to keep an eye on as we estimate and give outlooks on NII. Repurchase strategy \u2013 oh, the repo. The repo line is just the earnings on the repo book. Some of that \u2013 it's a pretty typical repo book. Some of that includes some repos that are designated under FIN 41 with netting, all that is, I think, well laid out in terms of balances and size in our K in the footnotes. I think it's footnotes 10, 11 or 12. You can find them. But that's recurring earnings, because it's effectively a matchbook of repos and reverses, and so that line will now, as rates have flowed up, will tend to recur. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then premium amortization? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Premium amortization is not significant at this point in our book. I think it was down just slightly, but not enough to call out as a movement of NII or NIM this quarter. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, good morning. First question, just there's been a lot of chatter on amending the SLR, perhaps removing some of the denominator, central bank cash or other things like that. How much \u2013 I mean, obviously, that would free you up to expand your balance sheet in deposits. Is there a lot of do you think pent-up, I guess, volume out there that you could put on? Because I would think the incremental profitability with no SLR impact could be pretty significant. Just trying to get a sense of what that deposit opportunity could be if they were to alter the SLR. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Jim, let me start and then I'll let Eric quickly jump in. I think that I agree with your point, which is there is a lot of discussion \u2013 even public discussion. I thought it was notable that when Governor Tarullo gave his ending speech a few weeks ago that he spiked out (39:53) custody bank excess deposit/SLR issue as something that was probably an unintended consequence. So I probably never felt better about the uniform view that excess deposits (40:11) leverage ratio was unintended and probably should be corrected over time. Not sure when it will be corrected in what form, whether they exclude the excess deposits or whether they ladder (40:24) adjust the leverage ratio. But I think the outlook is pretty good from the standpoint of getting some relief to be determined when and in what form. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah. And let me \u2013 it's Eric. Let me just add to the tactical question. For the leverage ratio to be adjusted, there're obviously a number of different scenarios in which that could happen. I mean, we don't know. If it does get relaxed, certainly there is an opportunity to accept more deposits. I think there's certainly a lot of liquidity floating around the system, both here in the U.S. and in Europe. Obviously, the question is at what rate, and so we'd want to be judicious about that. There's also an ability to lighten our preferred level in the capital stack. We have call options on most of those tranches and so could adjust there. I think what I would point out, though, is certainly there's a question as to whether the rules get \u2013 to get adjusted but also how. Because, remember, the leverage ratio, it affects us as a bank on an SLR basis, right, under the SLR rules, but also the spot current leverage ratio impacts us in terms of CCAR and the CCAR ask. So there're kind of two different parts to the leverage ratio that matter. And then I'll also remind you just to be careful that if leverage is not a binding constraint for a bank, then at some point, RWA and CET1 is. And so there's a lot of moving parts here that we'd have the consider if there are some changes. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Right. Absolutely. That's why I think deposit growth would probably be the better outcome versus CET1 running up against CET1. And maybe, Jay, a question on middle-office outsourcing outlook, it seems like your mutual fund clients have faced some pressure. Do you see those discussions picking up? And what's your kind of outlook on the pipeline for that since it is a little bit higher margin? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yeah, Jim, there is enormous pressure, as has become very visible in the last year or so on the traditional long-only fund companies and so they're doing everything they can to get more efficient. And it has created an uptick \u2013 a significant uptick in not only deal flow, but the complexity of deal flow, meaning the middle-office. Gosh, I would get to at least an half of the mutual fund related activity today that's got a middle-office component. And even probably, more interestingly, it also has a data component to it. So there's DataGX, which is a fairly new offering for us where we act as the data integrator, taking the middle-office, not only the data that we have but data from other custodians. That product is surging too. So I think it's a natural consequence of more downward pressure on the investment management business generally. And we're in a pretty good place, given the product offering and the things that we're continuing to do, not only to help solve the middle-office issue, but edge our way into the front office with DataGX and other analytics products. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. So you feel good about the pipeline? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: I do. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Eric, you mentioned at the beginning of your remarks efforts to bring GAAP and operating earnings closer together. And clearly, you've made the change around discount accretion. But is there anything else you've done there or anything else you're thinking about doing? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Jeff, it's a good question. We've certainly had a history of the disclosures with GAAP and operating. I think there's some benefit to that, right, because they provide you a sense for the underlying business, especially the big program like Beacon, their restructuring charges that are important to note. I do think, though, that there's investor interest, there's analyst interest, and making sure we're as simple to understand as possible. I met with a number of you down in New York, here in Boston over the last couple of months, and that came through as some of the feedback that I picked up. So I think you saw us narrow down the number of lines. Discount accretion was all of $5 million, and so to kind of call it out as a separate line, I'd rather just tell you how much it is and incorporated in both results just to make all of our work easier. So I think you saw us take a step change this quarter. I think we'll continue to reevaluate during the course of the year. And, obviously, year-ends are a more natural time to make \u2013 to potentially make some more changes. But I'll be out there listening and seeing if there is some feedback one way or the other, and we'll take it from there. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Hi, Betsy. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Good morning. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. A couple of questions. One, a bit of a ticky-tacky one just on operating deposits versus non-operating deposits when we're talking about deposit beta highlighting there're some things that are different this time around, that's one of them. And just wanted to understand how far along you are in shrinking the non-operating deposits that you have? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah, Betsy, it's Eric. I think part of the optimization that you saw us do over the course of the last quarter is obviously focused on the excess deposits or the non-operating deposits. I think those come in a couple of flavors, right? Some deposits by virtue of coming from financial institutions, and there is a very broad definition under the U.S. and Basel rules, all count as non-operating. I think you saw us a couple years back reduce those amounts, and we want to stay in a comfortable zone because those financial institutions, hedge funds, private equity funds, those are our natural clients we're servicing. And even though those don't count as sticky deposits, we may think they should, but they don't under the rules. We need to accommodate those and we'll continue to do that. So I think we've made some step changes there a year-and-a-half ago and are comfortable with the level. I think what we find is in the balance of our business, what happens is you have deposits and up to a point, they count as operating. And over that point, when they are above the kind of natural flows that you would expect them to cover, the rules require you to do some calculations or statistical analysis, designate a kind of a level for different types of clients based on their activities and the levels above that tend to be excess. Those are the ones that we've obviously spent more time trying to calibrate and adjust. It's not a science, but that's what we're focused and that's been the effort. I think, going forward, as I said, I think the balance sheet size is comfortable where it's at. We'd like to keep it flattish from here. I'm an ex-Treasurer. So I always say down a tick just to keep things tight, but we like where we are. We'll always do work, though, under the surface. And so we still have a wholesale CD book in the $8 billion to $9 billion range. If some good client deposits come in, I can bring that down. That would improve NIM because of the interest rate cost differential, and you'll see us take those kinds of actions if we can. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great, Eric. And then just second thing. We talked a little bit about the SLR and the CET1. How do you think about the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio? If you didn't have these other constraints to consider, what do you think a good range is for running the bank on that measure? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: That's a good question, Betsy. And I've not actually spent a lot of time with that historic measure, probably because we have so many measures, whether it's SLR, fully phased-in SLR, we have CET1, we have Tier 1, we have advanced and standardized. And so, to be honest, my perspective is I expect some refinements on the current capital rules, but not so much that we could go back to some of those historic measures like TE to TA. I think that will just be an outgrowth of what the current rules are, to be honest. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Got it. Okay. Hey, thanks a lot. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Eric, the first question for you. Can we talk a little about other operating costs? Normally, they seem to come down a little bit in the first quarter. Did not see as much of a decline linked quarter, in fact, year on year, and I recognize there is the GE acquisition partly, but it's up very sharply. So could you tell us what's going on with that line and why it's running a little higher than it has previously? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Sure. Other operating expense \u2013 and I think other folks on the call can find it on the supplement or the earnings report, it's up year-on-year really for two reasons. One is the GE sub-advisory fees actually get booked in that line and that was about \u2013 I think about half, a third to half of the uptick. The other is that there is some regulatory and insurance costs, right. There's FDIC, there is some of that equivalent in Europe, and I think there might even been some of those VAT taxes (51:20) and so forth that come through on the expense line. Quarter-on-quarter, what you did see is a reduction. The quarter-on-quarter reduction is down about 5%. And that was professional fees coming down, some of that is we've in-sourced more of regulatory activities, so you see that in a different line, as an example. But that was down sequentially. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : So, looking forward, any color on how we should think about that given that that's clearly running on a year-on-year basis much higher, presuming the sub-advisory fees are going to (52:02) regulatory, obviously, down from the fourth quarter, and same with the insurance.? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah, I think that's fair. I think you can think of that line as flattish \u2013 within a range. I think there's some volatility. We've got some of our regulatory costs, but those at least \u2013 unless we hear more, right, from some of the supervisors, we expect those to continue, and some of those are good run-the-bank kind of activities. So I think relatively flattish going forward. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A question for Jay. Jay, there was a comment in the release about hedge fund outflows having some impact. Can you give us an update on where you stand on that? What you're seeing in \u2013 since that's obviously an important client base for you folks, and you've been a leader in that one? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Sure. Happy to do that, Vivek. As you know, over the past probably 10 years, we have moved into the alternative administration space, both hedge, private equity, and real estate and, in fact, are a leader in that marketplace. And you also are well aware that the hedge fund industry has suffered many sequential quarters of outflows due to performance and other reasons. And so we would reflect some of that movement. And in the quarter, we continue to see outflows in hedge funds. And I would just suggest that we hope that turns, but we're not fully in control of that. But I'd also mention that that's just one dimension of our servicing complex. I could also point to a few other things, just to provide some balance. The long-only business \u2013 the traditional long-only business in the U.S. actually looked a little bit better. You've seen outflows for a long time. That kind of went to neutral in the past quarter, which we view as constructive. And then, just to give you a couple of other dimensions. Outside of the U.S., the offshore markets continue to run very fast, and we're the market leader in the offshore services, most of which are centered in Luxembourg and Dublin. And then just final point to that, just to give you kind of the highlights of the big movers. As money has moved out of hedge funds, we've seen it flow into private equity and real estate. And so, we've seen our private equity administration business pick up, and even real estate more recently, as the complexity of doing back-office for real estate assets is overwhelming some of the asset managers. So I would say I wouldn't focus overtly on just hedge funds. I think it's always a portfolio where some things are in favor, some things are out of favor. And I'd say, for now, hedge funds continue to look to be out of favor, which reflects on our \u2013 that component of our servicing fees. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And where are you on asset management? Since GE seems to have been well absorbed, any color on what you're thinking on that front now, and particularly from an acquisition standpoint? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yeah, I would say \u2013 my broad comment about asset management is, we feel we focused our strategy more in ETFs and solutions, and we've been making investments. And I think the performance that you've seen this quarter and the last couple quarters is a reflection of that. So we feel good about the space that we've decided to compete in. And the GE Asset Management acquisition has exceeded expectations from a standpoint of getting everybody onboard and even having a little bit of \u2013 it's early days, but some uptick in new business. It's given us much more variety in our asset classes in order to fulfill our solutions business. And from an acquisition standpoint, Vivek, I would say there's probably some gaps, smaller gaps in our asset offering that, if we could fill them with a team or a small acquisition, we would entertain, but nothing more significant than that. Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks, Jay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard's team. Thanks for taking our questions. Just regarding the BlackRock business that is being transferred to JPMorgan. Are there any deposits with that business? And if so, how much is going? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yeah \u2013 go ahead. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Steve, it's Eric. There's a bit of deposits with every client that we have, and we'll certainly factor that in, and that's factored in our view of this year and next year. I will say, though, there are more deposits that tend to come our way than go. Our treasurer and our businesses do quite a bit of balancing between price and just active discussions with our servicing counterparties about how much they can leave with us. And so, if a little deposits flow out, let me tell you, there'll be other clients who want to leave deposits with us in a pretty simple exchange. Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Understood. Thank you. And just a second question regarding your dividend. What are you guys thinking about, just as far as a long-term dividend payout? Is something like a 40% fair? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Steve, it's Eric. I think that's a good question, and I'd kind of answer it in two ways. I think we're comfortable with the current level of dividends versus buyback. It gives us a good amount of flexibility in terms of the capital structure. We like the opportunity to have the mix that we have. And, obviously, that's all part of our CCAR ask that we submitted back in April. I think I'd also say that, as said has (58:50) become clear, that there isn't really a 30% dividend cap as a way to return capital to shareholders, we'll consider over time whether we want to make some adjustments, but that will be something we consider. But no, no new news to report at this point. Steven Duong - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yes. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks. So just two quick questions really. You did mention on the new business yet to be installed that was coming in with higher fee rates than what you currently see across the company. Is that also the same for the BlackRock business that's going away? Is that a higher fee rate business as well? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yeah. Let me just clarify that, Brian. What I described is that it's a higher \u2013 the $375 billion is a higher level of backlog to be installed than we have traditionally had. And connected to that, I mentioned that the reason for that is that they're bigger, meatier, more complex deals, therefore, they have a longer implementation timeframe. You can infer from that that there's more middle-office and complexity and so a higher fee rate. The BlackRock business is kind of standard kind of 1940 Act-ish straightforward common trust fund business, so a little simpler. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. And then, was there any impact from the run rates from the sale of the BFDS business? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: There was not in this quarter. It's Eric. Brian, there's not in this quarter just because it was done at the end of the quarter. There'll be a small one, but it's fairly minor in the scheme of our revenues and certainly incorporated in our fee and revenue guidance that we've provided. Brian Kleinhanzl - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing remarks. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Thanks, Hope. And I just want to thank everybody for their participation today and we look forward to speaking with you in July with the second quarter results. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Thanks, Anthony. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our second quarter results, delivering a record level of quarterly earnings per share that reflect continued strength in global equity markets, as well as momentum in our asset management and asset servicing business. We also, for the first time, exceeded $31 trillion in assets under custody and administration this quarter, fueled by a combination of new business activity and higher equity markets. In June, we celebrated our 225th anniversary. We're proud to be in a rare category of companies whose success is measured not in years or decades, but in centuries. We've been able to achieve this success by focusing on our clients and on key markets, while delivering new solutions to address our clients' needs. We continue to invest and obtain long-term benefits from Beacon, which is core to the next phase of advancing State Street. We're making progress in digitizing our operations and providing new capabilities and information advantages to our clients. We continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders. In June, our Board of Directors approved a $1.4 billion common stock purchase program following the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan under its 2017 CCAR process. Our 2017 capital plan also includes an increase of approximately 11% and our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.42 per share starting in the third quarter of 2017. Now turning to slide number four. I'd like to review our progress on our strategic priorities and some key achievements this quarter. We continued to deliver broad-based growth from our core franchise, with new asset servicing wins of approximately $135 billion for the quarter and our highest levels of assets under custody and administration at quarter end with growth of 12% from the second quarter 2016. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was $370 billion, and our pipeline of new business opportunities remains robust. SSGA finished the quarter with $2.61 trillion in assets under management, a 13% increase from 2Q 2016. The majority of the growth from 2Q 2016 was driven by market appreciation, and 5% of the increase was from the acquired GE Asset Management business, which continues to support growth, including the win of the GE Alstom UK business. We completed the integration of the acquired GE Asset Management business in the second quarter, which had already turned accretive ahead of schedule in the first quarter. I'm also pleased to say that momentum in our Global Markets business continues. Our FX business, with its distinctive research and breadth of trading platforms, increased its ranking significantly according to Euromoney 2017 FX survey, as we were rated fifth with real money managers and hedge funds globally and that's up from seventh and 11th place, respectively, the year earlier. This increase in market share is reflected in the 13% growth in FX trading revenue from 2Q 2016. Beacon continues to advance with our investments in technology, next-generation platforms, enhancements to operational performance and connectivity across the enterprise and through the delivery of innovative solutions and insights to our clients. Eric will provide you some more detail on the progress that we're making with Beacon in a few minutes. We remain focused on providing clients with innovative solutions to address regulatory risk and analytic requirements, their investment needs and supporting the achievement of their growth objectives. Some examples of the benefits of our ongoing investments include solutions for regulatory reporting, risk analytics and collateral management and the broadening and deepening of our OCIO capabilities with the acquisition of GE Asset Management operations. We've also developed our Market Entry Solutions, which is an integrated value-added service that leverages our global presence and expertise to assist our clients with their global growth strategies. Our mission is to provide clients with information insight, access and partnership to support their global product development and distribution ambitions. So, in closing, we remain focused on achieving our financial goals as reflected by our year-over-year quarterly positive fee operating leverage of approximately 190 basis points and total operating leverage of over 270 basis points. This resulted in improving our pre-tax operating margin to over 33% for 2Q 2017 and helped us increase EPS 14% from 2Q 2016 and 18% in the first six months compared to 2016, while generating a return on equity of approximately 14% for the quarter and 12% in the first six months of 2017. All of these are on an operating basis. I'd now like to turn the call over to Eric, who'll cover the financials and then we'll open the call to your questions. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Thank you, Jay, and good morning everyone. Please turn to slide 5 where I will start my review of our operating-basis results for second quarter 2017. EPS for 2Q 2017 increased to $1.67 per share, up 14% from 2Q 2016. 2Q 2017 results reflected continued momentum in fee revenue, driven by higher equity markets, new business wins and positive client flows, as well as growth within our markets businesses. 2Q 2017 results also reflected higher NII as a result of the rising interest rate environment, disciplined liability pricing and improved liability mix. We delivered approximately 2 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage and achieved a pre-tax margin of over 33%, up almost 2 percentage points. And importantly, ROE also improved to over 13%, up 1.4 percentage points. Now let me turn to slide six to briefly review growth of two key drivers. First, AUCA increased to record levels of $31 trillion, up 12% from 2Q 2016. Growth was driven by a combination of market appreciation and net new business and client flows. AUCA growth translated into strong revenue increases across our three geographies and spanned a broad range of products and client segments. As compared to 1Q 2017, both AUCA and revenues were up nicely. Second, at State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 13% from 2Q 2016, driven by market appreciation and the impact of the acquired GE Asset Management operations and positive ETF flows, which were partially offset by continuing institutional net outflows. Please turn to slide 7 where I will focus on 2Q 2017 fee revenue results, which were up 9% relative to 2Q 2016. You'll also find detail in the appendix for the sequential quarter comparison. Servicing fees increased 4%, primarily due to higher global equity markets, new business installations and client activity on a year-over-year basis. While our wins were broad-based, we saw particular strength in EMEA, alternatives and middle-office outsourcing for asset managers. Management fees increased 38%, reflecting the contribution of the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher global equity markets on a year-over-year basis. On a sequential quarter basis, both servicing and management fees demonstrated solid growth, increasing 3 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively. Trading services increased relative to 2Q 2016, primarily reflecting gains in market share and increased activity in emerging markets, offset in part by lower volatility. Securities finance revenue increased from 2Q 2016, reflecting continued strength in enhanced custody. Processing fees and other revenue decreased from 2Q 2016, primarily reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange swap costs, which are primarily in NII this year. As a reminder, 1Q 2017 processing and other revenue included a $30 million gain related to the sale of BFDS/IFDS. Moving to slide 8, NIM was up 16 basis points from 2Q 2016, and NII was up 13% on a relatively flat balance sheet. Strength in NII was the result of higher market interest rates in the U.S., disciplined liability pricing and our continued focus on improving our liability mix, partially offset by a smaller investment portfolio. On a sequential basis, 2Q 2017 NII benefited from higher market rates as well as lower levels of wholesale CD funding. NIM was up 10 basis points sequentially, a portion of which was non-recurring, so we expect closer to a 3 to 5 basis point uptick in the third quarter, given the June Fed rate increase. Interest-bearing client deposit pay has remained relatively low, within a 20% to 25% range. And even with our disciplined pricing, we did see our deposits tick up sequentially, as clients continue to look for outlets for their U.S. dollar cash. Now I will turn to slide 9 to review second quarter expenses. 2Q 2017 expenses increased 7% in total from 2Q 2016, with approximately 3 percentage points of that increase related to the $51 million of expenses associated with the acquired GE Asset Management business. Excluding those acquisition-related expenses, compensation, employee benefits increased from the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased cost to support new business, incentive compensation and merit increases and regulatory initiatives, partially offset by Beacon savings. Information systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increased modestly year-over-year and in line with new business and planned investments. Other expenses increased, primarily reflecting the costs associated with the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher regulatory and insurance expenses, partially offset by lower legal-related costs. 2Q 2017 GAAP results also included a pre-tax $62 million charge related to the restructuring associated with Beacon, which will provide benefits within the next five to six quarters. As compared to 1Q 2017, expenses decreased 5 percentage points, reflecting the 1Q 2017 seasonal deferred incentive compensation expense. Excluding this seasonal impact, sequential expenses increased 3 percentage points, reflecting net new business, merit increases and the timing of incentive compensation awards, partially offset by savings related to State Street Beacon. Let me now move to slides 10 and 11 to review our progress on State Street Beacon, as well as highlight the range of initiatives that enhance the client experience and increase operational efficiencies. Starting on slide 10, you can see four tangible benefits that are improving the client experience. First, we are leveraging our global scale to improve the speed and efficiency of key services, transaction processing, fund accounting and fund administration. Each of these three services has a detailed set of metrics that we track, a subset of which you can see on the right side of the slide. In particular, we are seeing strong benefits as we roll out and clients adopt our new technologies and tools. Second, we are upgrading our core platform architecture, integrating with new technologies and investing in IT capabilities. Third, we have made good progress expanding Beacon across the organization. Earlier this year, we launched effectiveness and efficiency initiatives in the corporate function and in SSGA, while we also centralized our procurement and real estate processes. Lastly, on the revenue side, we expect the development of innovative client business solutions, such as our recently-launched SEC Modernization product to result in incremental revenue, some of which we are already seeing in our sales pipeline. Turning to slide 11; Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. On the left side of the slide, we show the year-over-year growth benefits and investment expense related to Beacon. You can see on the bottom row our previously-disclosed 2016 net savings, as well as our 2017 guidance to achieve at least $140 million. Each quarter, we carefully pace the level of investments to consider multiyear initiatives, support immediate opportunities and calibrate this to the external environment. The net benefit varies each quarter, and in 2Q 2017, we recognized approximately $25 million in year-over-year net expense savings. On the right side of the slide, we have broken out the growth savings by major categories that I just described. Approximately 70% of the projected growth savings in 2017 is a result of leveraging our scale and dispersing resources across our global platform. The balance comes from improving our technology and expanding Beacon deeper into the organization. Each year, the mix of benefits will change up or down as we identify opportunities for improvement. Now let's turn to slide 12 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, including an investment portfolio with a well-structured and diversified mix of securities. Our capital and liquidity position remains strong. We repurchased $227 million of common stock in 2Q 2017, which completed our repurchase under our program announced in July of 2016. Our new capital actions announced just last month continue to demonstrate our commitment to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends. While we were relatively pleased with our CCAR results, we are obviously digesting the detail as are other banks. We will carefully operate and optimize under the current rule. And of course, we are monitoring for potential developments. Let me briefly update you on LCR reporting requirements. We will begin to report our quarterly average LCR in August. On an average daily basis for 2Q 2017, our LCR is above the 100% standard as you'd expect. Moving to slide 13, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our financial outlook. In summary, we are very pleased with the year-to-date progress against our original 2017 outlook. Importantly, in 2Q 2017, we saw good revenue momentum; we continued to deliver a good operating leverage and our pre-tax margin expanded nicely. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, prudently managing expenses and executing on State Street Beacon, while driving growth in our core franchise. So based on the strong year-to-date results, let me provide an update to our 2017 outlook relative to 2016. First, we now expect fee revenue growth for the full year to be in the 6% to 7% range, assuming the present favorable market conditions continue to prevail throughout the remainder of the year and the U.S. dollar remains stable relative to major currencies. Second, we expect fee operating leverage to be towards the upper end of the 100 basis point to 200 basis point range that we communicated in January. On the expense front, we will continue to calibrate expenses against the revenue backdrop, but also in light of client installation requirements. Third, due to strong year-to-date NII performance, we expect 2017 NII to be within a range of $2.43 billion to $2.45 billion or an increase of approximately 12% to 13% from 2016 levels. Lastly, we continue to expect our tax rate to be at the lower end of the 30% to 32% target we communicated in January. Let me briefly touch on third quarter 2017 before turning the call back to Jay. We expect trading services revenue to be muted as activity usually slows in the summer, while securities finance revenue should decrease from the elevated seasonal levels experienced in 2Q. We expect NII to increase in 3Q 2017 due to the Fed's most recent move at the end of June, but not at the same magnitude as we saw from 1Q to 2Q. In summary, we believe we are well positioned to achieve these full-year 2017 financial objectives. Now, let me turn the call back to Jay. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Thanks, Eric. Victoria, we now like you to open the call to questions. Operator : Certainly. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Hi, how are you? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Good morning. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : So the fee growth is great, even if you ex-out the GE acquisition. So it feels like there's a little bit better leverage to equity markets than the whole 10%, 2% rule of old. But I don't know if you could help with how much of that is just emerging market versus developed market growth and the fee differential there? I don't know if you've ever shared with us what the fee differential is, but good to see, nonetheless. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Glenn, it's Eric. Good question and let me give you the summary. It's really all of those elements, right? So you remember equity markets are up nicely in the low teens. Bond markets on the other hand are actually flat to down. In some cases, hedge funds markets, private equity are kind of mixed. So you kind of have to factor all that as you think about the AUCA growth. I think what we did see was actually a nice mix, both on the AUCA front in terms of growth and on the fee \u2013 services fee area in terms of growth. We saw a nice mix of some support from market appreciation, some nice contributions from flows. We've seen flows broadly distributed this quarter and this \u2013 for the first half of the year across Europe, U.S. mutual funds, ETFs, right, all those are flowing in positively given our clients and the market. And then net new business has been good. You see we continue to have wins in the marketplace. We still have a pipeline that we've been carrying that's $350 billion, $370 billion, $375 billion over the last couple of quarters, and that's getting implemented literally month-by-month. So it's really a combination of all the factors you described. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : And is there a large fee differential EM versus developed markets? Or does that get bundled into a global client all-in fee? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: More and more it's bundled as a global client, right? We have clients that operate around the world. The fee discussions capture all their businesses. You have some differential between lower-volume emerging markets, but even those are more typically in the \u2013 are quite advanced economies these days, slightly different fee levels at bonds versus equities, ETFs versus mutual funds. I mean, there's a dispersion but I don't think it's as dramatic as it once was. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : Appreciate that. The last little one on balance sheet, you alluded to but I look for a little more color. The rate paid on non-U.S. deposits went negative from positive, small numbers but went negative from positive, yet those deposits actually still grow. I'm just curious if you can give us a little more color on what drives that? Obviously, that's what you're talking about on your pricing discipline. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yes. I think the \u2013 probably the best page to take a look at for folks is the supplemental information package, the page 13 where you see the average interest-earning balance sheet. I think you saw a couple of things. I think the international deposits, remember, have a component of swaps that are tagged against those that feature into NII, and so that's why you see the lumpiness from quarter-to-quarter. We actually pushed our international deposit pricing down a bp or two, just given the \u2013 our need to earn appropriate returns internationally, and also because we continue to see a nice inflow and willingness, almost the need from our clients to leave balances with us. They're doing that in euros, in sterling, in yen. They're doing that in dollars. And so, we've got high demand on, I think, for clients to leave cash with banks. They're \u2013 a lot of that, they're steering towards us, and we obviously have a limited capability to accept too much of that given the leverage ratio constraints that we need to keep in mind. Glenn Schorr - Evercore Group LLC : All right. Thank you for all that, Eric. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess, in some of the buckets that they were particularly strong this quarter, and wanted to start, I guess, with the security lending. So nice uplift, it feel like seasonality has been softening over the last couple of years. So maybe, as you look at the sequential change, can you help us understand kind of what was the seasonal uplift this time around versus more kind of normal growth? And then, I guess, the more important question is, enhanced custody obviously continues to contribute here. Where do you guys still see the runway in that business, which, I guess, continues to be pretty strong? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah. Alex, it's Eric. Let me start. I think, as you described, seasonality and traditional SEC lending a little lighter than it's been historically, but we've still seen a decent amount of seasonality. Part of that just might be where we are in the market cycle. Part of that is there's the usual dividend activity and so forth that you'd expect. On the enhanced custody side, I think, there we're actually seeing a continued pattern beyond seasonality of growth in revenues. Part of that is, we're serving more clients. Part of that is, we're going a little deeper with select clients. And so that \u2013 on \u2013 and that business was really a mix of both seasonality and growth on a year-over-year basis. And so, I think, you can kind of take a look at the year-on-year comparisons. That's a good proxy for a growth of the two businesses. The quarterly uptick, a little more seasonal. But we also have to remember, right, there's volatility in these businesses, they ebb and flow. And so, with a very strong quarter, we're quite pleased, but it will move up and down, and I think we all need to factor that in. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Sure. And then, just as far as some of the excitement around capital relief on the back of the treasury white paper. I'm sure you guys got a bunch of question on that, but with Tier 1 leverage being obviously the more binding constraint for you guys in CCAR, what is the latest that you guys hear in terms of the ratio being augmented to kind of calibrate closer to what SLR could potentially change to or just making broader adjustments to CCAR that would alleviate against some of the pressure points there. And I guess, if any of those things do happen, how should we think about the kind of newfound capital that you guys could either grow the balance sheet or return to shareholders? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Let me start that one, Alex. This is Jay. The \u2013 I thought the treasury report I'm sure everybody's gone through it by now was a pretty balanced report with regard to ways to recalibrate and fine-tune some of the Dodd-Frank and Volcker legislations. So, I think, it was a good framework. And hopefully, once we get some of these appointments with the Fed and other agencies, they'll start to attack that. For us, we have a pretty narrow set of concerns and issues. The most prominent one is the one you mentioned, which is the drag that excess deposits have on the leverage ratio. And that is prominent, not only in that report, but in all the conversations that I have with regulators. Everybody, I would say, acknowledges that, that was an unintended consequence of the regulations. So I think there's a real desire to fix it. The fix, the conversation around a fix is kind of two dimensional. One way to adjust the excess deposit issue for the trust banks would be simply to rescale the leverage ratio and that's one of the conversations out there so that you'd give the custody banks a little bit more headroom to accept these deposits. And at the same time, put in place some kind of a provision so that in a crisis or in a market event that we get relief from the leverage ratio. So that's one kind of conversation, which would tend to just deal with the trust bank issues of the leverage ratio. And then the broader thought out there is to reduce the denominator of the leverage ratio to accommodate central bank deposits, and that's, remember, that Bank of England took that approach in their leverage ratio. I'd say, and obviously that would treat not only the trust banks but the other, the rest of the banking industry as well. Those are the two paths that are being discussed. I think it's going to depend on, again, new appointments and getting people in place and figuring out what the best way to deal with it is. But I have very high confidence. I can't tell you when that the issue will be addressed because I think it's acknowledged in all circles that it was an unintended consequence of the regulations. With regard to the broader regulatory reform agenda, as I say, our needs, our issues are narrow. I think more broadly though if we get to extended cycles on the resolution and recovery plan, if in CCAR, they held the balance sheet flat, all that would be additive to not only the cost of complying with regulation, but as you rightly mentioned, freeing up capital within State Street. Eric, I don't know if you'd add anything to that. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yes, I think we're quite pleased to just see some balanced discussions and reports coming out of Washington. We think even Governor Tarullo, as he wound up his tenure, I think was supportive of some of these changes, which are really in the bucket of unintended consequences that have come through. Jay covered several of them. Another one is on the Volcker rule. The Volcker rule in an unintended way captures the seeding of new mutual funds and other types of investments that an asset manager has and if that asset manager is held within a bank environment like our SSGA business, it's kind of, you're guilty until proven innocent that it's not propped trading when in fact, all you're doing is seeding a new investment or a new mutual fund. So we're optimistic that at multiple levels, there is an evolution here. We're certainly engaging with folks at multiple levels just to help articulate how to move the pendulum in a prudent way that gets us to where we should be. Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. Great. Appreciate you guys taking the questions. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. First question just on the operating fee leverage guidance, you're still calling for 100 to 200, and it looks like inclusive of SGA, it's more like more like 320s through the first half. So can you just talk us through, either what do you expect to change in that relationship in the second half? Or are you just continuing to have a conservative guide given always the uncertainty of the environment? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Ken, it's Eric. The answer is really the second part of that, of your question, which is we've got to be conservative, right. A year-and-a-half ago, no one thought the equity markets would swoon like they did, and that is always a risk notwithstanding the indices like VIX and so forth, are at all-time's low. But we know when things feel good is when you should be vigilant. I think we're also just trying to be conscious that as we have revenues, we also have an installation pipeline, as we have new wins that we're carrying that pipeline through. And part of what you're seeing us do is we actually have to start to onboard new clients, put people against that build-out infrastructure and technology to plug them in. And so, part of what we are trying to signal is, we absolutely will calibrate operating leverage in the 100 to 200 basis point range. We'd certainly \u2013 we've hinted that \u2013 or more than hinted, we'd like to be towards the upper end there, but we're mindful that, that the installation of those clients, especially those global clients who are particularly complex and have a broader set of offerings, take some energy and some spending. So we'll be disciplined here. I think we're very pleased with the first half, but we don't have any interest in resting on our laurels. And we know we need to maintain a pattern, a consistent pattern of positive operating leverage. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Got it. Okay. And then secondly, if I could just dive one depth further into the liability cost side. Can you just help us go that extra mile on the U.S. deposit cost? You mentioned the wholesale funding. How much of that was a helper from 50 basis points to go to 38%? And then on that non-U.S. side, can you help us understand the delta in the hedge, the $25 million last quarter, and what that went to this quarter? Thanks again, Eric. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah. Let me do this at a couple levels to help answer your questions. So first, if you think about the 10 basis point uptick that we saw, I'd say 4 or 5 basis points of that this quarter was really market levels floating up, deposits which re-prices the asset side of the balance sheet, offset with disciplined pricing across both the U.S. and the international jurisdictions. So we saw good performance there. We then saw couple basis point tick down from, as we rolled off some of those wholesale CDs that I mentioned. And then there was a couple of basis points just from market dislocations. We saw the swap costs were a little lower this quarter than previously. That moves around with markets. It moves around with which currencies we're swapping. And so we had a little more of a tailwind than we would have expected. So those are the combinations. I think if you had decomposed the deposits, on a tactical basis, total U.S. deposit costs were down 12 basis points. The underlying is that the CDs drove actually a bit more than that, kind of 15 basis point, 16 basis point roll down, and U. S. deposit costs were up by just four. And when you compare that to a 25 basis points move of the Fed, that's a 20% deposit beta, which is kind of the zone we've been in. We've been signaling 20% to 25%. I think it's coming at the lower end of our range. On the international deposits, I did say earlier the underlying international deposits actually fell by a basis point in terms of cost. The rest of the movement is in the swap, the furnishing swap costs, which we've actually enumerated in the footnotes of page 13 back there if you want to just do the math. Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC : Perfect, yes. Thanks for the color, Eric. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Hi, Betsy, go ahead. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you hear me? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yes. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right, great. I just had a couple of follow-up questions. One was on, Eric, the LCR. You mentioned that starting in August regulatory reports are going to require that you disclose the LCR ratio in a composition, Eric. Could you just give us a sense as to what you've done to manage your position going into this announcement? And how you think about managing it as you're going to be disclosing this on a quarterly basis? And what you would recommend folks like us think about or look at as the numbers come out? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Sure. I think the demand on the LCR has certainly predated me. The team two, almost three years ago when the LCR kind of came of age and got finalized did a couple of things to drive compliance. First, we added some deposits to our underlying balance sheet, right, and some of that was in the form of wholesale CDs. And we did that because we needed that term structured that extended beyond the 30 days, 60 days, 90 days that you want to be at. I think secondly, the team then did some very good work to itemize their deposits and create clarity on which ones were operating versus excess and actually balance \u2013 rebalance that mix. And you saw the reduction almost two years ago, deposits of about $20 billion, $25 billion. And that was really driving out excess deposits but actually keeping or actually increasing over time those operating transactional deposit balances. And then what you've seen us do over time is we've continued that mix improvement, right, under the surface so that their operating deposits continue to trend upward. And that's given us the luxury to actually work down some of those wholesale CDs. So I think there has been a program in place here over a two to three-year timeframe to actually prepare. I think we feel like we've now been operating under the LCR rules for kind of three years, but the last year has been really on a BAU basis. And so I don't think it's going to change a lot of our management going forward. Those are the rules. The rules are the rules, and they're there for a good reason and we'll operate within them. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So is there anything left in non-operating to wind down here? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Nothing that's terribly significant. There's always a little bit, and there's always an ongoing optimization that you do. We have a decent-sized alternatives accounting and fund administration business. That's with financial counterparties like hedge funds or private equity. And the Fed has deemed that as a 100% access. So we don't think that's right. We don't think the model support that, but \u2013 so we need to keep some amount of access for those clients and we'll do that. But there's no big step change that we expect. And in truth, the best thing to do from an LCR management standpoint is now to operate with a healthy LCR. But you don't want it to be neither too thin, nor to rich, right? If it's too rich, you're leaving money on the table and you can redeploy that into lending or securities. If it's too light, you're scraping by. And so I think there's a nice middle ground that we'd want to operate in. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. And then just lastly, on the guidance that you have for the NII for the full year, obviously part of that uplift is this quarter, and it looks like there's a bit of an uplift also from 3Q, 4Q, but maybe at a slower pace than 2Q's uplift. And my question is that just a function of being a little bit more conservative on the cost of funding given that some of the benefit this quarter came from what looks like swap market activity that maybe you're baking into the base case. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah, I think the \u2013 that's the right way to think about it. We had a nice uptick from 4Q to 1Q, another nice uptick 1Q to 2Q. But I think the \u2013 you can't bank on a full 10 basis point sequential uptick, again even with the Fed, the rate rise, we think the underlying core in that 10 might have been 5 basis points, 6 basis points depending on how you count. Given that we have a little more of that now, we expect 2Q to 3Q uptick to be closer to 3 basis points to 5 basis points because some of it's already in the run rate. And that after that, we have to wait and see. There's been a lot of talk about deposit betas, where they'll go, when will begin to flow it upwards. That hasn't happened. We've had nice stability in our deposit betas. We've had nice stability in our deposit base, but I don't think any of us with bankers want to get out ahead of ourselves and predict what \u2013 exactly what they'll look like in 4Q and then into next year just yet. Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Super. Thank you so much. Really appreciate the color. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Let me just circle back on the NII outlook. What are your assumptions for \u2013 specifically for the rate backdrop in the second half in terms of Fed hikes and the tenure? And then I assume that you're still assuming like around a 25% deposit beta in the second half as well? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Brian, it's Eric. That's about right. So we've been at the 20% to 25% right now. We think that for this June hike, we'll be around that level, but you never know for sure. We expect the June rate hike to come through, and then potentially a December hike. But since it's so late in the year, that really won't have much of an effect on 4Q. So that's our interest rate forecast. I guess, what I would say is, if you step back, so far, deposits have performed well, I think, in this rising rate environment. I think part of that is that we remix the quality of the deposits and pushed out a lot of that access two years ago, and then we've been managing carefully over the last year to support that. And then partly because the deposits from the custody banks I think actually respond in a decent way. If you think about it, there's a hierarchy of response in deposits across different sectors, right? We all know that in retail, you have quite low deposit betas, and that's been shown for cycle after cycle. I think at the other book end in the corporate sector where you get corporate treasurers, they're actually quite willing to shop their money, especially because they keep them for cash management and earnings credit. They'll move that around. They are borrowing from banks, and they're quid pro quo sometimes is, hey, you've got to pay up on deposits. So I think the corporate sector and even high net worth tends to have a higher betas. And we're in the middle as a custody bank, right? We're doing with end-of-day cash, asset managers and pension funds who want to cover their transaction flows, who aren't really tempted to drawdown lines, right? That's not something that they look to do. And so I think the custody banks are in this middle ground between retail and corporate, and that's part of the reason why our deposits have responded well through the first couple rate hikes. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's great way to characterize it. And then my follow-up question, also sticking with the balance sheet. If you can talk a little bit in more detail about the repurchase agreement financing that you've been doing? Specifically, I'm looking at the securities purchased under resale agreement line that revenue went from $46 million to $69 million in NII. It's about a third or so of your Q-on-Q NII increase and I think over half of your year-on-year NII increase. Can you just talk about how that business is going? How sustainable that is? What are you doing exactly to see that pretty remarkable improvement in revenue? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yes. So that's the \u2013 we detailed that well in the footnote. That's the support of our clients in the FICC repo program. That's a clearinghouse for repo. We arranged those repo trades with clients. These are clients who have surplus cash. What they want is, they want to leave that cash but they want to get securities as collateral, right? So they're looking for a collateralized deposit in effect. We can effectively help them process that through the FICC clearinghouse. The FICC clearinghouse does well over $1 trillion of repo. And you see that we're facilitating on the order of $30 billion, $35 billion for clients. So, this is just part of the support that we have for asset managers and other types of custodial clients. It has been in place for a number of years and we're there facilitating in the marketplace in ways that they appreciate. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Are you growing it based on client adoption of using that service that you're providing? Or do you think more of the growth is driven from the Fed hikes? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: The growth is just \u2013 the volumes are relatively stable. They're up a smidge, but it's \u2013 we do this as an accommodation as part of our business model. The rates are typically reverse repo rates, so those are just floating up in line with market reversed repo rates, general collateral. Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick one on \u2013 again, on deposits. Sorry, it's the topic du jour here. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Popular. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, yeah, big focus, very active here this quarter. And when we think about non-operating deposits, could you just maybe update your outlook for those? And how fast you might think they could run off in this environment? How much might be like baseline operating need the business as usual type of balance? Thanks. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Yeah, Brennan, it's Eric. That's a \u2013 it's a fair question, but it's one where it's hard to answer definitively, right, because we are in a new environment. That said, you've seen \u2013 we've seen some kind of a gentle volatility around the levels that we're at, $42 billion, $43 billion, $44 billion, or $45 billion of non interest-bearing deposits. You've seen it tick up. It's ticked down. Year-over-year, it's flattish actually and quarter-over-quarter, it's down $2 billion. And the question we're wrestling with, are we beginning to see, and we probably are some transition from non interest-bearing to interest-bearing. But that's been predicted by our treasurers and every other treasurer on The Street. It feels like since the first rate hike, right. And so the $2 billion move, which is less than 5% of the non-interest bearing deposits this quarter, actually is less than what we expected. And so I think there will be some transition over the coming quarters. It's hard to predict how much it is, but it's all factored into our deposit betas. Remember, you're moving from effectively zero interest-bearing into what might be a stated rate. A stated rate for us as a bank is in the 10 to 15 basis points relative to a 25 basis point Fed hike that quarter. That's actually all factored into our deposit betas. And in fact, the way we characterize that is our deposit betas for interest-bearing deposits are 20% to 25%. When you factor in all the non interest-bearing deposits, those that are not moving and those that are maybe beginning to transition, the deposit beta in aggregate for total deposits is more like 15%. So it's factored in. I think we expect it to trend downwards, and we're certainly prepared and it's part of our overall outlook. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. That's great. Thank you and your overall outlook actually, I think, includes some reduction in the interest-earning assets, 0% to 5% for the year. When we look at the 2Q balances versus in 4Q average, we're already down about 3% and I think 3.5% roughly. So is that right to imply that you guys expect the pace of decline in interest-earning assets to moderate here in the back half of the year? Thanks. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Brennan, if you can tell me when what will happen with surplus cash in the system, I can give you an answer to that. I think we continue just to see clients look for outlets for their cash, right? That's been happening ever since money market reform. The clients naturally come to their custodial bank to do that and they're doing that around the world. So the balance sheet is down, like you say, a couple of percent year-to-date. If we can hold that level, that would be good. If we can trend down a little more, that obviously gives us the room in the leverage ratio. But at the end of the day, we need to balance both how we want to ideally operate the balance sheet with being responsive to our clients because that's who we're here for. Brennan Hawken - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks so much for the color. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Hey, good morning, guys. A quick question on CCAR. It seemed like you guys were hit by OCI as you moved quite a bit to held to maturity, some of the higher-quality securities to held to maturity didn't offset the potential losses, I guess, elsewhere. Is that going to change the way you approach it going forward, or do you stick with the plan as you have it now? Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: Jim, it's Eric. Let me give you a little perspective. I think overall, we were pleased with CCAR in the sense that we wanted to take the dividend up 11%. We wanted to return $1.4 billion of capital through buybacks and the review proved supportive of that. So I think we were pleased. I did say in my call text that we continue to look for transparency and try to understand the models because it's multiple models at the Fed. There are credit models that we were trying to make sure we understand. There are PPNR models, right, and sort of different levels of PPNR for different banks and then for different banks within the same kind of cluster or same category. And then like you say, there's the OCI models, which seem to move and create a larger stress than we expected. I think the first part of our reaction to CCAR is always just to manage our business and balance sheet carefully, right. And I say that in two ways. One is you're always trying to do your best with earnings. You give some of that back to shareholders, but some of that accretes on the balance sheet and you see our capital is up year-to-date. The second part of that is we're always trying to manage the balance sheet in a tight way. We talked about deposits and the balance sheet being tighter year-to-date. And part of that is because we want to run with a leverage ratio that's got the right levels. And you see that in 4Q 2016 on page 12 of our earnings deck, our leverage ratio was 6.5%. We're now at 7%. And what is that? That's actually the earnings accretion into the capital count as well as the tighter balance sheet, which has gotten us there. So just over the first six months of the year, we got 50 basis points more cushion when it comes to a step off. So that's where we're at. After that, we're always going to look at the models and ask questions around are there refinements that we could make on our mix of assets, mix of securities, et cetera. But I think you can expect us and every bank to be doing that. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Right. Okay, well, thanks. And any update on the timing and impact from the movement of the custody assets to BlackRock? Thanks. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yes, Jim, this is Jay. No, no update. Sometime in 2018, probably an elongated transition would be my best guess. James Mitchell - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Thanks guys. First question, just on the foreign exchange and the trading; you guys had a good quarter definitely versus peers and I know the platform is a bit different. But just what was maybe environmental driven versus strategically? It seems like there's more of a focus on growing that business than there has been, and so just over the next year or two years, where do you see that opportunity on that side of the business? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Sure, Mike, I'll start that. This is Jay. As you point out, we do have a different foreign exchange franchise than some of our peers and that it's pretty broad-based and it's supported by some pretty intriguing research. So I would say that we compete at a different level with regard to foreign exchange. I referenced in my comment, the Euromoney survey, I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's the \u2013 kind of the go-to survey in the industry. And we moved up by quite a few paces \u2013 places in that survey, which to me means market share gain. And I think we've got a broad foreign-exchange offering. We added a number of new clients this quarter, which is not unusual. We to continue to add new clients. Environmentally, I'd say the global and EM trade helps. But I would say generally, gaining share, which has driven higher volumes, a little help by EM, and just broad-based participation across all aspects of the foreign exchange market. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: And Mike, it's Eric. I'd just add that the market share gains and kind of deepening our relationship with individual clients is what drives the kind of sustained year-on-year performance. The piece that's a little more volatile is whether you've got the flows going into EM and in to Europe and Asia like you did this quarter. I think that was a nice uptick, but that's not always going to happen. And so what we found is having a broad-based franchise, because that's what we are. We're well distributed around the world with these global clients, actually is the way to build this business sustainably over years and years. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. On the asset management side, just given the outflows this quarter, I don't know if you can put some perspective on it in terms of just kind of industry trends and some of the pressures that we're seeing there, maybe on the equity side. But in terms of the \u2013 some of the other maybe buckets like alternatives, can you just \u2013 what was maybe some one-offs versus how do you see that business growing going forward? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Yes. Let me start out, Mike. I'll just decompose a little bit the flows and then make a few comments and invite Eric to make comments he wants. We had the flows of $28 billion, $22 billion of that was kind of institutional low-revenue outflows, the ETF story which is one that we've been focused on. The quarter was a little bit unkind to domestic equities and therefore, we saw almost $10 billion in outflows of our big spike, S&P 500 fund. Take that out, we had $5 billion in inflows. So I would say, if I step back, we weren't thrilled with the quarter. We thought it was a little disappointing. Over the last four quarters, our ETF flows have been at $56 billion net inflows. So a little softer on the ETF side, a little bit of it in environmental. We are \u2013 we continue to invest in distribution as well as new product introductions. We introduced nine new products in the second quarter, some in the smart beta space, which we think is an attractive and natural space for us. European ETF sales were good. It's a smaller market, but we really punched above our weight in Europe. So I would say that's kind of the broad-based commentary. The only other thing I would reference is if you look at the SSGA franchise, very global institutional ETF on a retail basis. We're focused on the ETF marketplace and also broadly solutions. And I referenced that we completed the GE Asset Management acquisition, which gives us a prominent position in the outsourced CIO marketplace. We were able to add some incremental business from GE, the Alstom business, and I think that just builds a little momentum in the outsourced pension space. We're also doing pretty well on the outsourced \u2013 or the solutions for retail 401 (k)s, target date funds. So I'd say, my summary would be not a particularly great quarter for SSGA. I think the trends are intact. Our focus on ETFs and solutions would be my summary. Eric W. Aboaf - State Street Corp.: And Mike, it's Eric, I'd just add. This is an attractive business for us. ETFs have good price realization relative to the overall price yield in asset management, and that's what's actually been supporting the revenues. And so incumbent upon us to predict \u2013 to continue to invest and make sure those investments bear fruit in ETFs, because not only in the U.S. but around the world, they're here to stay, we have to do is just pick our spots and make sure we do that in areas like smart beta or high-yield fixed income that are more fragmented where we feel like we can build share and the scale at pace to earn good returns. Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I know you touched on this before, but the enhanced custody business really feels like it's becoming a pretty meaningful driver of securities finance. So, can you elaborate a bit on how meaningful that is in terms of the overall securities finance contribution and the growth and where you'd like to get it to? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Sure. I'll start that, Geoffrey. You are right to pick up on that. We've seen steady and consistent growth in our enhanced custody business. I think this quarter it approached 50% of the overall revenues. And as I say, that's been steadily climbing. And I think it's a business that plays right into some of the capital constraints that traditional prime brokers have. And as our clients take on enhanced custody, they tend to deepen relationships over time, pretty stable, pretty steady. So I would see that business continuing to gain share in the credit intermediation space for funds. Some of that is in the kind of the long, short type portfolio is probably where it's most prominent. But good business, I think we were a clear innovator four or five years ago and we're now reaping the benefits of that investment. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : And apart from the traditional prime brokers, is there any other competition there? Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: No, I'd say that's the typical competition. It's \u2013 you see funds diversifying their credit exposure, which is how we pick up business, new funds being created. No, it's mostly the prime brokers are the other alternative. Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay for any closing remarks. Joseph L. Hooley - State Street Corp.: Thanks, Victoria, and thanks everybody for participating this morning. We look forward to getting together after the third quarter to report our third quarter earnings. Thank you. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Good morning, everyone. Before I begin my remarks, I'd like to take a moment to thank Anthony Ostler, who has moved into a business line role and also to welcome to State Street our new Head of IR, Ilene Fiszel Bieler. Ilene recently joined us and has over 15 years of experience in the financial services industry and is reaching out to those of you she doesn't already know. Now, to my remarks, we have delivered another very good quarter. Our third quarter results, including EPS growth and a meaningful increase in return on equity reflect continued strength in equity markets and strong business momentum. We are continuously advancing new product solutions to support our client success, which in turn has helped drive new servicing commitments of $105 billion. Importantly, new business opportunities remain robust across both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. We remain well positioned to achieve our 2017 financial goals, including objectives associated with State Street Beacon. Through Beacon initiatives, we are focusing on delivering what matters most to our clients and their clients in less time and with less risk. By improving speed, adding data and analytics capabilities and upgrading client-facing technologies, we are enhancing the end-to-end client experience. While we continue to invest in our business, returning capital to our shareholders remains a key priority. In 3Q 2017, we purchased approximately $350 million of our common stock and declared quarterly common stock dividend of $0.42 per share. Now, turning to Slide number 5, I'd like to review some of the progress we made on our strategic priorities and key achievements this quarter. Our core franchise continues to grow. Strength in equity markets and new business lifted our assets under custody and administration to record levels with growth of 10% from third quarter of 2016 to $32.1 trillion. And for the first time, we've also exceeded $1 trillion in assets under administration in each of our two offshore businesses, in Luxemburg and Ireland. And as I mentioned, the pipeline remains strong. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was sizeable at $390 billion, which we expect to onboard over the next 18 months. SSgA finished the quarter with $2.7 trillion in assets under management, a 9% increase from the third quarter last year, primarily driven by market appreciation as well as follow-on wins from the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher yielding ETF inflows. It's come primarily from institutional investors. Continuing with our focus on new products and solutions, we recently announced the launch of a suite of low-cost SPDR portfolio ETFs, targeted at a new distinct channel to registered investment advisors. To focus on the separate distribution segment, we have partnered with TD Ameritrade, the number-three registered investment advisor platform as their sole distributor or 15 low-cost commission-free ETFs. Across the industry, approximately 60% of ETF flows are being directed to this fast growing segment and partnering with a top distributor allows us to expand our delivery through this new channel. Beacon continues to drive scale across our business as we optimize and automate our solutions. For example, in our core U.S. mutual fund segment, which is approximately $7 point trillion in assets, Beacon has enabled us to accelerate the development of capabilities to allow clients to respond to the upcoming SEC modernization requirement, as well as improve the end-of-day pricing process by 20 minutes to 30 minutes. In closing, we're committed to achieving our financial goals as reflected by our third quarter operating base year-over-year 27% EPS growth, positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as improving pretax margins, all while turning capital to shareholders and improving our ROE by 2.3 percentage points to 13.4%. Now, let me turn the call over to Eric, who will review our financial performance for the third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and following that we'll take your questions. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, where I will start my review of our operating basis results for 3Q 2017. EPS for 3Q 2017 increased to $1.71 per share, up 27% from 3Q 2016. Return on equity for the quarter improved to 13.4%, a 2.3 percentage point - 2.3 percentage point higher than last year's third quarter. 3Q 2017 results reflect continued strength in equity markets and new business activity in both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. 3Q 2017 results also benefited from the rising interest rate environment and disciplined liability pricing, resulting in an expanding NIM and strong NII, which I'll discuss further in a moment. 3Q 2017 expenses continue to be well controlled, the weaker U.S. dollar added 1% of expense growth relative to 3Q 2016. As a reminder, the currency impact associated with expenses is largely offset in revenues. 3Q 2017 results also benefitted from a lower than expected tax rate of 28%, primarily due to a higher share of lower tax, foreign earnings, which was worth approximately $0.04 a share. We delivered positive operating fee leverage relative to 3Q 2016 as we continue to focus on calibrating expenses relative to the revenue environment. Importantly, pre-tax margin improved meaningfully to 32.9% increasing 2.2 percentage points from 3Q 2016. And on a year-to-date basis, we continue to see good progress against our financial goals demonstrated by delivering EPS growth of 21% and 2.7 percentage points of positive fee operating leverage. Now let me turn to Slide 7 to briefly review growth of two key drivers. Both, AUCA and AUM increased again this quarter. AUCA of $32.1 trillion, increased 10% from 3Q 2016, growth was driven by a combination of market appreciation and good business momentum. New business activity was particularly strong in EMEA. At State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 9% from 3Q 2016 driven by market appreciation, new business related to the higher yield in GE Asset Management operations and ETF inflows as we continue to expand our franchise, partially offset by continued outflows from lower fee institutional mandates during the quarter. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll primarily focus on 3Q 2017 fee revenue results relative to 3Q 2016. You'll also find additional detail on the appendix with the sequential quarter comparison to 2Q. Overall, fee revenues increased 5% from 3Q 2016, driven by higher equity markets and new business activity. On a sequential basis, overall fee revenues were flat given the usual summer seasonality end markets activity. Servicing fees increased 4% and 1% from 3Q 2016 and 2Q 2017 respectively, reflecting higher global equity markets, new business wins particularly in EMEA and the U.S. middle-office services, and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar. These were partially offset by continued outflows from hedge funds, which caused us more than 1% of servicing fee growth on a year-on-year basis, as certain large players in the industry continue to see lower balances. We have seen some signs of this trends starting to moderate. Management fees demonstrated strong growth for 3Q 2016 increasing 14% reflecting higher global equity markets, and cash, and ETF flows. Fees were up, excluding the market impact, as lower fee institutional asset outflows were more than offset by better fee ETF and cash inflows as well as new wins from the GE Asset Management operation. Trading services revenue decreased from 3Q 2016, primarily due to lower foreign exchange volatility than what we experienced after last year's Brexit vote, partially offset by higher client volumes. We gained market share and real - with Real Money investors moving from number seven to number five in the most recent Euromoney survey. Securities finance fees increased from 3Q 2016, primarily due to continued growth in our Enhanced Custody business. Moving to Slide 9, NII was up 20% and NIM was up 29 basis points from 3Q 2016. As you can see from the graph momentum in NII continued in 3Q 2017, driven by higher U.S. interest rates and disciplined balance sheet management across major currencies in which we operate. On a sequential basis, 3Q 2017 NII and NIM benefitted from realizing a full quarter of the June rate increased and disciplined liability pricing. Notably, U.S. interest bearing client deposit betas remain relatively low around 25%. Deposits decreased sequentially, as we continue to reduce higher cost CDs and non-USC [ph] deposits, and saw the slow rotation of client deposits from non-interest bearing accounts to interest bearing. U.S. interest bearing client deposit costs increased by only 5 basis points sequentially. Overall, we're pricing deposits carefully and reducing wholesale CDs, which were down $15 billion year-over-year to manage the size of our balance sheet in line with our January guidance have down 0% to 5% for 2017. Now I'll turn to Slide 10 to review 3Q 2017 expenses. 3Q 2017 expenses increased approximately 4% from 3Q 2016 with approximately 1 percentage point of that increase related to foreign currency translation. Excluding the FX impact, the increase in expenses was driven by new business, annual merit and performance based incentive as well as additional investments in technology, partially offset by Beacon related savings and lower professional fees. Compensation and employee benefits increased from a year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting increased costs to support new business, annual merit and incentive compensation and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by Beacon savings. Notably, almost 2 percentage points of the year-over-year increase in compensation benefits was related to a sizeable mandate and which we lifted out a portion of the clients' employees. This is an example of the increasing expenses that we expect during the on-boarding period for some large clients. Compared to 3Q 2016, information systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increase the result of new business and Beacon related investments, other expenses decreased from 3Q 2016, primarily reflecting lower professional services fees. 3Q 2017 GAAP results also included a pre-tax $33 million Beacon restructuring charge, which will provide payback on average within the next five to six quarters. As compared to 2Q 2017, expenses increased only 1% and were flat excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Let me now turn to Slide 11 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Beacon remains on track to achieve $550 million in targeted program savings, including at least $140 million in 2017. On the left side of the slide, we show the year-over-year growth benefits and investments related to Beacon. Each quarter we carefully pace the level of investment to consider multi-year initiative, support immediate opportunities and calibrate this to the external environment. The net benefit varies each quarter. And in third quarter 2017, we've recognized approximately $35 million in year-over-year expense savings. On a year-to-date basis, we have achieved approximately $100 million in pre-tax expense savings relative to our $140 million target. On the right side of the slide, we've broken out the key initiatives and percentage of the relative benefit approximately 70% of the projected growth benefit in 2017 comes from driving scale across our global platform. The balance comes from improving our technology and driving Beacon deeper into our organization. Each year the mix of benefits will change as we identify opportunities for improvement. And as I mentioned last quarter, we continue to make good progress expanding Beacon across the organization. We're getting traction with both the corporate functions and SSGA, while we also centralize our procurement and real estate processes. Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet, our investment portfolio is well constructed and diversified, but we've chosen to modestly reduce our credit securities to make room for direct client lending, and to better prepare for our internal stress test and the annual CCAR process. We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases, including buying back $350 million of common stock and declaring in dividend of $0.42 in the third quarter. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our capital ratios by retaining income and by optimizing the size of our balance sheet. Specifically, you can see that our Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 90 basis points from last December to 7.4%. Our SLR also increased nicely. Moving to Slide 13, I'll update you on where we stand regarding our original and updated financial outlook for full-year 2017 and for fourth quarter. In summary, strong 3Q 2017 and year-to-date results have us well positioned to exceed our 2017 financial target. Year-to-date revenue growth of greater than 8% and fee operating leverage of more than 2.5 percentage points reflect our focus on driving top line growth, while calibrating expenses against the revenue backdrop. This balanced approach in 2017 has resulted in a year-to-date pre-tax margin of almost 31%. Based on the strong results, let me provide a brief update on our 4Q 2017 outlook. First, we expect higher 4Q servicing fees to be offset by muted trading revenues compared to third quarter, as we continue to see less market volatility. Overall, we expect to exceed our 2017 full year guidance of 6% to 7% fee revenue growth, and even excluding the gain on a couple of divestitures, we expect to be at the high-end of that range. Second, on the expense front, we expect a slight 4Q 2017 increase over third quarter, largely driven by expenses associated with new business activity. 4Q 2017 expenses will also be dependent on the revenue backdrop in the quarter and the onboarding of new clients. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to be at the high end of our full year fee operating leverage guidance of 100 to 200 basis points. Third, we expect to see continued NIM expansion 4Q of a few basis points, from bit more asset re-pricing and continued liability management. We also expect a slightly smaller balance sheet as we continue to build capital ratios and prepare for CCAR. We thus expect NII to be relatively flat to 3Q and anticipate that this will put us at the top-end of our full-year NII guidance. Lastly, as I mentioned earlier, we expect our 4Q tax rate to increase relative to the third quarter, resulting in a full-year operating basis tax rate near the low-end of our full-year range of 30% to 32%. In summary, we're very pleased that both our strong 3Q results and year-to-date performance sets us up well to achieve the higher full year 2017 financial guidance that we discussed in July. Now, let me turn the call back to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Thanks, Eric. Victoria, we will now - we are now available to handle questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. Hey, Eric, I was wondering if you could just talk us through some of the balance sheet permutations. I know you've been purposely trying to get the leverage ratio up going into CCAR 2018 versus where it was a year ago. Going into the fourth quarter at 7.4%, can you just talk to us about how you're trying to still hold back the rate of growth in the overall balance sheet and what we should expect for the mix going forward? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Ken. Let me give you a little context. I think a year-and-a-half, two years ago, we made a - decided choice to reduce the size of the balance sheet and bring deposits down to the tune of $20 billion to $25 billion. I think it's an ongoing process and we saw a little bit of a tick up towards the end of last year during third quarter and fourth quarter, which is why we signaled in January that we wanted to bring the balance sheet to trend it back down. And I think we're making good headway. You saw that fourth quarter last year our balance sheet was about 5% higher than it is now. So we feel like we made good progress, our tier 1 leverage, which tends to be our binding constraint under CCAR and some of the stress test, was that 6.5%. And the kind of the work that we've done, both with clients and then with non-client deposits, including the CD book that, that we had built several years back has really positioned us well now with a tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.4%. Going into the fourth quarter, I think those efforts continue. Nothing dramatic, but we continue to expect a mild trend downwards as the - as we continue to unwind the CD book, as we continue to compress the current - a couple of higher cost deposit areas. And our view is that, it will set us up well for the coming year. And then it's - to be honest, it sets us up well for growing naturally, right, over the course of the coming years, as AUCA grows at a nice pace between market and new business wins, clients expect to be able to leave a little more deposits each year with us and I think we'll kind of get back into more of a business as usual mode at that point. Ken Usdin : Got it. And my second questions, just on the U.S./non-U.S. point, you've had the benefits of the currency mismatch and then you have the swap that kind of works that out. Can you just help us understand if the BOE and ECB, who have been getting more hawkish start to hike rates? How will that actually flow through the NIM and net interest income? Eric Aboaf : Hey, Ken, it's certainly something on our minds, right, because the U.S. has clearly moved 4 times over the last year, which we're quite pleased to see. The Bank of England is starting to signal and market expectations are probably a bit better than half that they'll move. It's been moving around. And the ECB is really talking about - at some point slowing down their expansionary policy. I think for the way to think about it, is about half of our net NII interest rate exposure to rising rates within the U.S. and the other half is in international markets which is primarily sterling and euros. You saw us take up NII just from rising rates in the U.S. by $20 million to $25 million a quarter. So it's sizable and if you think about - sterling will help a little bit if it moves and euros even more. But you could see, as and when that happens, I think some more NIM expansion, which would be a good result. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe we could just talk a little bit about the fee rate. I appreciate the color on hedge funds. I think even if we think about adding the 1% drag back, AUCA was up 10%, fees were up, say, normalized 5%, if normalized for hedge funds. Do we see - I know ETFs have been a growth area that's probably lower margin. But is there some sense that we could start to see those move more in tandem at some point going forward? Joseph Hooley : Hey, Jim, this is Jay. Let me start that one. I'll let Eric jump in. So the one thing I guess I'd just reorient you to is the third quarter 2017 versus 2016 up 4%, year-to-date up 4%. Third quarter little bit of a softer quarter from a service fee standpoint. I'd say, I'd point to a couple of things, one, the mix which you mentioned is mixed and you see - in the U.S., you see U.S. fund outflows offset by ETF inflows, almost one for one if you look at the industry. And then if you - we reference hedge funds, which continue to see outflows, although industry data would suggest maybe that has hit the tipping point. We haven't yet seen that in our book, but were - a pretty good reflection of the overall hedge fund industry. And if you go outside the U.S., I'd point to, Eric mentioned that in his comments, EMEA, or more specifically Europe played out through the offshore centers of Ireland and Luxembourg, continue to see very strong flows, which is a mix of long-only product hedge and ETFs as well. So I would say the mix has been pretty consistently like that. I wouldn't read anything into the quarter itself. I look more on the year-on-year to look at the reflection of kind of the service fees. The only thing I would add before I ask Eric if he wants to add to this is the - the pipeline is good. It's good. It's well diversified. And it's probably proportionately a little heavier in big deal activity, which you know for me is a reflection of more folks looking to consolidate work among fewer custodians, and an interest in doing a deeper level of outsourcing, think about middle office is one component of that. So I'd say, generally, pretty steady as it goes. I don't know what you'd add to that. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Jim, I'd just add on the fee rate. Just remember, this isn't the - the servicing business is a little different than the asset management business, in asset management the fee rates are linear, right, as you add more assets you get automatically higher revenues in services. You kind of get 10% higher market. AUCAs is only 3% in equity. It's 10% [ph] and 1% [ph] in fixed income. So you kind of have that denominator effect. And then you have the mix of whether it's hedge funds, whether it's emerging markets are at higher rates than the U.S. and so on and so forth. So I think the way we think about the fee rate is it's something to track, because the question is, as Jay described, are you doing more business with clients, more business with existing clients and the more business you do with existing clients tends to offset the mathematical reduction you'll get in fee rates just from the way the numerator and denominator work through. James Mitchell : Okay, well, that's all helpful color. And maybe just my second question, Eric, you've been now at State Street for a little while. What's your sense of Project Beacon? Do you feel like there is - are there any more opportunities as you look into this more over the course of the next few years or do you feel like it is good target or an easy target, trying to get a sense of - your sense of the expense line as you dig into it? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Jim, I think the - my perspective on Project Beacon, like you say, I've dug into it now. I've dug into it at a couple of levels of details as you'd expect and it's something that Jay and Mike initiated a couple of years back and really was a follow on to that original ITOT effort. I have a lot of confidence to be honest that there is a lot to do. And why is that, because we run a servicing process and system that has become more and more automated over time. But you remember, we take on very large mandates from very large asset managers, pension funds, insurance companies. And they usually hand them over to us in a fairly bespoken customized manner. And they like it when we execute on them in that basis. And so, there is a lot of work to do as you march across one large client to the next large client, to the group of medium sized clients, as you march around the world to continue automate and digitize and simplify those processes over time. And so, as I looked underneath, Beacon isn't one effort, right, it's actually dozens and dozens of effort. So there is a lot there. And I think it will be something that we keep at. We originally announced it as a four, five-year program. I think our view is Beacon will continue, right, because it's got to be part of our DNA and how we manage the business. And then I think I did say in my prepared remarks, there are also new areas of Beacon that we continue to push on, whether it's the corporate functions, right. We spend a $1.3 billion or so of our $8 billion expense base in the corporate functions and so that needs to be under scrutiny as well, carefully, but under scrutiny. Ron O'Hanley is driving Beacon into the asset management business. So there is always more to do and I think we see good opportunities in the coming years. James Mitchell : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Quickly on the assets under custody and administration, the insurance and other products is down another 5% in the quarter. The markets have been doing good, something unique in the quarter to point out? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Glenn, it's Eric, and I think for the others on the phone, I think you're pointing to the supplemental information package on the assets under custody are on Page 7. There is actually nothing significant going on with the insurance clients. I think the line you're looking at, which is the fourth one down, is actually - has three sub-lines, got insurance, got private equity and it's got other - insurance and private equity are actually flat sequentially, so some upticks offsetting some - just the usual movement. And then the other line which you kind of can see underneath the surface is more volatile and that's due to timing of installations. What effectively happens as we bring on new business, right it gets categorized in other and then you need to do a detailed categorization up into the lines above and that just plays over a couple of months. So you've seen this - I think we've seen this volatility a little bit before and just think of it as classification volatility, nothing more than that. Glenn Schorr : Okay, okay, and then quickly on balance sheet, I noticed, the rate paid on your U.S. deposits is down the last couple of quarters, which is also in a raising rate environment. I'm just curious if you could talk towards how you manage that dialogue and what type of clients that is. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Glenn, there's a couple of things in the U.S. deposits on the average interest earning balance sheets, right? There is the - I'll call core client deposits and then there is the wholesale CD book that we had built up to the tune of a bit over $15 billion year-and-a-half, two years ago. So what's happening on that line is you actually see a mix effect. As the CD book comes down, the overall rate paid on total U.S. deposits is coming down. And that's offsetting the slight increase that we're seeing quarter-on-quarter, as we adjust rates up a little bit every time the Fed has moved. If you wanted to unbundle that the cost of deposits for just the U.S. client deposits is up 5 basis points, right, against a 25 basis points move in at the Fed and that's where we - that's how we quote the beta of 25%. So kind of it's moving up exactly as we would have expected at this - given the external dynamics. Glenn Schorr : Awesome. Thanks, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. My pleasure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning, everybody. So I had a follow-up around just the servicing business either for Jay or Eric. Totally get the fee rate dynamic, obviously more of an output and as we've learnt over the years. But I guess taken a step back given the mix shift dynamic with hedge funds. The BlockRock issue coming up, I guess, next year with some of the loss business, but then clearly some positives on the non-U.S. side, et cetera. Holding kind of market's effects flat, what do you guys see as a reasonable organic growth for the servicing fee revenues over the next couple of years? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric. It's hard to tell precisely, which is why we have - we've stuck to our general view that we should focus on overall fee growth, we said 6% to 7% now that was up from 4% to 6%, there is obviously some market movement in there. You see the - I think, if you want to dive down into servicing fees specifically, you see those were up 2% on a currency adjusted basis year-on-year, and up 4% year-to-date, right. And so the - in our mind 4% for a little more representative. Now clearly, there's a number of factors in there, right. There is some market appreciation, there's some inflows and outflows, and we called out more than a percentage point from the hedge fund business, there is some amount of new business activity, and then there's a very important amount of expanding activity with existing business, and then there's a little bit fee headwinds, more or less than we've seen before, but it's always been a little bit of that over the last couple of decade. So it's - I think, it's hard to be precise and part of what we're trying to navigate through is, we're always looking at what business can we bring on, at what fee rate. But in particular at what margin, right, because it's the margin that really matters at the end of the day. And then, as we think about new business at the right margin, and then, we kind of get to fee operating leverage, and we feel like we have a business system that is remunerative. So anyway hopefully that's enough guidance to start. Alexander Blostein : Got it. Thanks. And just quick follow-up around the NIM and the balance sheet dynamic. So clearly, very nice job on kind of remixing the funding and optimizing the strategy a bit, it sounds like there is a little bit more to do here in the fourth quarter as well. But also taking to step back kind of assuming the composition of the funding structures in place more or less so in the U.S. now, how should we think about the kind of NIM sensitivity to next - to near future funds and hikes given kind of changes we saw on the funding side now? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Alex. Let me - it's Eric, let me continue. I think, we're comfortable with our NIM sensitivity and in particular the position where we expand NII in the rising rate environment. I think, we've done - we've captured that benefit in the U.S. for the first three or four hikes, and that's been quite positive for us, and has helped us buoy NIM, but also margins and ROEs, that's important. I think, we'd like some amount of NIM sensitivity for the U.S. going forward, if we got a December hike, then we might as well stay open, right on from a rate position. And I think the Fed has signaled they want to get to - maybe not 3% terminal Fed funds, but two and three quarters. And we feel like, there is a big distance between now and then. And you remember the opportunity cost of running an open sensitive position to rising rates for us. As a custody bank is not very high, because at the front end of the curve, right? The front end of the curve is not particularly steep. So anyway long way to say that I think we'd like the open position in the U.S., we talked on one of the earlier questions being open in sterling and in euros, is helpful. It doesn't mean that if the 10-year doesn't spike up or we see some volatility where we have some nice uptick. We invest a little bit, but I think directionally we like the open position to rising rates. Alexander Blostein : Got you. I understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, Glenn had asked about the U.S. deposit costs, which you walked through nice, Eric. Thank you. On the non-U.S. side though, I think, if we adjust for the FX swap costs, we saw pretty decent pickup in the deposit costs there. Could you - number one, is that right? And then, if it is could you maybe walk through us going on there? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, I think on the international - what we've called the non-U.S. deposits on the interest bearing schedule, which is the Page 13, the math you'll want to do is to isolate the FX swap, which we put in the footnote, because remember the currency swaps, while they're tied the deposits from an accounting standpoint are offset on the interest earning asset size primarily they're in the deposits of the banks or in securities that we hold. If you were to, though - and if you do that math and we're happy to follow-up Brennan, as a - to help out with that. And you were to strip out the currency swaps, the change on the international side is, I think, literally 1 or 2 basis points, so it's relatively flat and within the scheme of what you'd have in any particular quarter. So we're not seeing much there, and we don't expect to see much there until either the Bank of England moves or ECB moves. And what I think it'd be a good day when that happen to be honest. Brennan Hawken : Sure, sure. Thanks. I'll follow-up on the math there. Another question on the deposit front would be non-interest bearing, we saw that decline. I think, you spoke about how there was some remixing and some clients that were rotating out of the non-interest bearing and into the interest bearing side. Do you guys have any view about ultimately where that might end up shaking out with the mix or look like non-interest bearing to interest bearing. How should we think about that going forward? Thanks a lot. Joseph Hooley : Sure, Brennan. I think, you are - what you've seen so far is actually even better or kind of within expectations or even a bit better, right. We saw a pretty slight $2 billion move out of non-interest bearing, which actually all ended up in interest bearing, when we actually did the detail tracking. And that's well within the bounds, it actually continues to positively surprise, how little has actually moved. And in truth if it moves, it's not that big of a deal. A couple billion a quarter would not be - is kind of well within, in fact it continues to be below expectations. In terms of terminal questions sort of where does it go, I got to say really hard to predict, I think, we don't see a fast move. So the question is, what's the - how much does it move and at what pace. And you've seen some - you've our results here, which are down just $2 billion quarter-on-quarter and about twice that year-on-year. I think, you've seen some of the industry results, which are probably a little bit more than that, but I think we fared well. And so it's hard to say, what that's going to be, I think you can look at the long range percentages of non-interest bearing to what the interest bearing. That's said, I think, pricing is different in this cycle, because we are pricing more adroitly for different types of deposits, right. Deposits that our LCR valuable, those that our non-LCR valuable. So I'm not giving you a sharp answer, because I think there is a range of results, and our view is, we should just work closely with our clients and to the extent they have a little bit in those pools. We'll help them, adjust them if they'd like to at the right time. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for the color, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Hi, good morning. Joseph Hooley : Good morning. Go ahead, Betsy. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Hi, good morning. Hi. Question on the outlook. I know that on Page 13 of the slide deck, you reiterated the guidance you gave in 2Q 2017 call. But then at the end of this call, you were highlighting that you thought you would exceed the 6% to 7% total fee growth range. Can you just give me a sense as to whether or not you're anticipating that full year could actually come above the high end of the range you've got here? Maybe you could speak a little bit to the operating leverage that you're looking for in the quarter. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Betsy, it's Eric. Let me start. I think, we feel good about the results overall on fee growth year-to-date. A little bit - bounce around a little bit quarter by quarter. But the way we've described this is that we feel like, on a full year basis for fees, which have been running about 8% year-to-date, we're going to be over the 6% to 7%. I think, I also said that if you wanted to put aside the BlockCross sale and the other first quarter IFDS, BFDS transfer agency sale, that if you put those ex slide, you're closer to the top end of the 7% range. And so it just gives you a little bit of data by which to calibrate what we expect. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Okay. So your Page 13 is more organic versus - the results will be obviously organic plus some inorganic activity. Is that fair to say? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, that's a good way to frame it. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Okay. And then, the follow-up is just on the SLR in the prefs. If the rule changes with SLR and we're - you are able to eliminate cash or reduce cash in the denominator of the SLR, is there any action you can take on your outstanding prefs? Or do you have to wait for them to mature? Eric Aboaf : It's Eric again. There - each of the series of prefs that we have out there, and there are several have a call date. The call date was typically five years out from the original issuances. So I think, there is some calls coming through over the next 12 to 18 months. And it actually gives us, I think, a nice bit of flexibility. So I think what we put out there was good at the time. And if the rules change, we can always adjust a bit. Betsy Lynn Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, I have one question about a negative trend and one question about a positive one. So the negative would be foreign exchange. It stays - it's staying very low. And do you see any change in that? And if volatility were to increase, say, 10%, what's the sensitivity of those revenues? And also, I - just on the topic of foreign impact. Emerging market asset values were up 8% quarter-over-quarter and I thought that would have had more of a positive effect on your custody fees. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Mike. It's Eric. Let me start on both of those. So first, on foreign exchange trading. I think there's just some evolution here given the volatility that we're seeing in the marketplace, right. And that's primarily what we attribute the changes to. If you recall, we had a particularly strong second quarter as we saw a very large shift to emerging markets. Emerging markets have typically much higher volatility and much wider spreads wider spreads, and I think we took full advantage of that in 2Q. And then a year ago, obviously, we had the backdrop of Brexit. So we're just seeing a lower level of volatility, and I think we're cautious. Underneath that market-driven kind of environment, though, we're seeing good volume growth - we're seeing good volume growth in developed markets. We've been drilling down. We've seen good volume growth in emerging markets. You see some of the results from the Euromoney survey, which isn't perfect, but it's indicative. And so we're actually, I think, quite pleased, and our view is if volatility comes back, we'll see some uptick. Hard to give you a percentage uptick. I'd do more of - 2Q was a standout. You can look at how much volatility spiked and kind of do some math, and we're happy to kind of be a sounding board for you as you do that. So I think what we're focused on is building that franchise. The franchise has been building. It feels like it's - by our estimate, it's picking up 0.5 point to a percentage point of market share over the last year or two, which in FX is actually significant. Maybe to the second question, on servicing fees, yeah, the equity markets were up nicely. Remember, bond market is not so much, alternative markets were kind of still are relatively flattish. So you got to do a weighted average kind of math here on the market indicators. That's why in the press release we actually give you a table of six different indicators, because it's a mix of those that really affect our business. And then, over and above that, there is the mix, how much are we taking on in ETF versus mutual funds, how much in the U.S., emerging markets. And so, the math kind of just moves around quite a bit, which is why we're focused both on a quarter but also on a year-to-date basis. And just we're kind of navigating through as we go here. Mike Mayo : And then the other question, management fees are up quite nicely linked quarter and year-over-year. What's happening in asset management and with the GE acquisition? And would you consider more asset management acquisitions? Joseph Hooley : Let me start that one, Mike. This is Jay. It's a factor of really shifting out of lower-revenue-generating assets and into higher-generating revenue assets. So if you look at SSgA in the third quarter, which had a net $25 billion in outflows, $40 billion, went out of largely passive institutional mandates, which has been a bit of a trend. And on the other side, you saw $12 billion into positive flows into cash, and $2 billion, positive flows into ETF. It's out of the lower revenue into the higher revenue, which results in management fees up 14% and AUMs up 9%. And that's not a one-quarter trend. We continue to see that, and it's been part of our strategy to focus on the higher-revenue-generating asset pools. I don't know if you'd add anything to that. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, I think it's a good result and you mentioned GE. Even there, we've bought it on. We've gone to accretion sooner than expected by a quarter. So that was, I think, good work by the team. But we also added some of the - some additional mandates, in particular some of the GE UK pension, the OSRAM [ph] pension and so it's been a nice platform and a good result. I think you also asked about acquisitions. Let me maybe start there, Jay will probably weigh in, too. But we like this, the kind of tuck-in asset management space, it's attractive. The accretion works out pretty well. Given the relative PEs of ours versus the asset management space, that was a nice size deal. And so clearly, they've come up from time to time, but it's certainly a good use of capital from our standpoint. Joseph Hooley : Yeah, I'd agree with all that, Mike, and I would say that if you look at where the gaps are and our asset management capabilities, we've got a bunch of gaps on the fixed-income side, a little bit on the equity and alternatives side. So to the extent that we can backfill those gaps, it makes us a more relevant player on the solutions space. I might just go one other place, Mike, on the asset management, which is, we recently announced that we were entering the low-cost ETF marketplace, and organically, although with a partner. The ETFs, 60% of ETF flows over some period of time have been on this low-cost ETF space, and State Street really hasn't participated because we haven't had the access to retail distribution. And so, we think it's a good move to enter a new distribution channel by taking 15 of our ETFs, translating them into low fees in concert with the TD Ameritrade partnership. TD is the third largest retail distributor. So it takes the ETFs, repurposes a handful of them, very low revenue give-up and positions us into this part of the market that's driving 60% of the flow. So not acquisitions we made there, but we do think that fills out a segment of the distribution market that we haven't been present in, and we think this enables that. Mike Mayo : Well, we'll watch that. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Oh, good morning, thank you for taking the question. Maybe the first one on the operating basis EPS number. Perhaps you could remind us the logic for stripping out the restructuring charges, which feel like they occur to a greater or lesser degree most quarters but not stripping out something like the BlockCross gain on the business sale. And then any thoughts about whether it makes sense to continue posting operating EPS or switch away to GAAP, which is what most banks do? Eric Aboaf : Geoffrey, it's Eric. Let me take that and I think you and I talked about that, and I certainly got a lot of feedback as I started back in December and January. I do agree that over time, GAAP results are something that we want to move towards. I think as you know, we've run a mix of both operating and GAAP results, we show them both so you can kind of see them both ways, so there are no surprises. I think what you've seen me do this year so far is actually narrow the difference, and we've done that both on some positives and some negatives together. And I think you can always kind of find one thing or another to add back. But I think what we'd like to do is move to a more standard presentation, and you'll see us doing that in the coming time periods. I just need to make sure that we're all - we design that well and we also do that with you all in mind so that it doesn't fluctuate with your models. I will say that we will want, though, to continue to be able to identify some of the restructuring charges not because we shouldn't include them in the GAAP results or the final tally of how we do. But one of the reasons we have carved them out and carved them out of operating is actually just so that you can see the underlying momentum of the business and expense management and not color that with whether a charge is $35 million or $70 million in another quarter. And so, we're just conscious that. I guess, the way I'd say is either way you are going to need to see the information. But because we are going to continue to optimize the business and drive Beacon, right, where are going to take a series of - I don't think it will be - well, series of expected charges. And we just want to make sure those are out there and everyone's expecting those. Geoffrey Elliott : Thanks, very helpful. And then, on the Ameritrade partnership, I noticed a few of the ETFs there are shifting to self-indexing. Do you think there is a longer-term trend there towards self-indexing to reduce the cost of ETFs? Is that going to be something that we see more of? Joseph Hooley : Geoffrey, this is Jay. Yes, I do think though. I think that in a world of low cost ETFs where every expense line matter to the extent that you can internalize or create some synthetic of an index or create your own indexing. I do see that as a trend, not just for State Street, but for others. Geoffrey Elliott : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. Joseph Hooley : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jay. I had to jump off the call for a minute, so I apologize if I you had addressed these questions. But the first question is, obviously, you've started to restructure the liability side of the balance sheet, as you mentioned. I noticed the non-interest-bearing deposits in the quarter fell to about $39.7 billion on an average basis from $42.2 billion in the prior quarter and about $44 billion last year. Aside from the obvious, interest rates are higher, were there any other factors that drove the non-interest-bearing deposits down. Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it's Eric. No, it's literally an interest rate effect and clients are conscious of what accounts they have. They typically have multiple accounts, right, sometimes for the various fund family, sometimes geographically and sometimes just for operational purposes or preferences. But this is the moment that we've seen, which is kind of 5%, 6% in the quarter, we think, it's pretty modest given that the Fed moved, in effect, 25 basis points here. So nothing more than rates and kind of all within the bounds if not even less of a move than we would have expected at this point in the cycle. Gerard Cassidy : If the Fed continues to raise rates, should we expect this line to continue on this kind of rate of decline? Or should it slow down, accelerate? Eric Aboaf : Very hard to predict, right. We - the kind of the structure of what exists out there for clients to hold in terms of deposits versus money market funds versus prime money market funds, right, they're kind of options that has changed since the last set of rate increases more than a decade ago. I think for kind of a general view, I think this pace feels about right for the time being, but there could be a range of results around that. But this pace feels realistic as we see rate raises play through. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then my second question, I know this is not a significant part of the balance sheet, but in the other interest earning assets for the quarter of $23 billion, you had a nice jump from the second quarter yield from 76 basis points to 118. Okay, any color behind what drove that nice improvement. Eric Aboaf : Yes, the other interest earning assets will include the Enhanced Custody activity, right, which is part of the sec finance business. And so as that - as we expand that business, we get paid both on the interest rate line as well as in fees. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. Eric, just on that last one, maybe if you can differentiate what's happening with the repurchased securities line. I think that went up 97 basis points on a core basis. And then the Enhanced Custody dynamic on the other interest earning asset line, and if you can sort of parse out the Enhanced Custody contribution to that other line, that'd be great. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Yeah, let me do those in reverse order. I think the - in interest earning assets - or other interest earning assets, which is about $23 billion, I think the large majority is Enhanced Custody and then you have a little bit of derivative balances and some of the other knits and gnats there. And so that's what's happening, and kind of underneath that in other interest earning assets, you'll find that derivative balances move around, but Enhanced Custody has actually been just moving up at a regular pace. And I think we can expect some amount of expansion there as we continue to grow the business at a modest pace, and you saw it up 8% year-on-year on revenue side, and I think we kind of - we think about the balance sheet scales accordingly. In terms of the securities purchase for resale agreements, right, the repo line, I'll just remind you that what you have in there is the on-balance sheet repo and reverse book. And then, the piece that is run through that FIC [ph] program or the - effectively sponsor a client, but it's the client's actual position and risk. We disclosed that in the footnotes and pretty well. I think what you'll see, as those rates continue - will continue to tick up in line with prevailing interest rates. So as the Fed moves, you've got movement in Fed funds, you've got movement in general collateral repo rates. And so what you're literally seeing is just the movement in market rates play through that activity. Brian Bedell : Okay, okay, thanks. And then, maybe just to go back to the security servicing. I know, it's been asked - and I appreciate all your detail on it. But if we just think about sort of how the new business trends are coming forward, and maybe if, Jay, you can chime in on this as well, but with the shift towards ETFs, and I think, Jay, you mentioned some larger pieces of new business in the potential pipeline. How should we think about that fee rate going forward? It looks like, of course, it's kind of dropped down sort of in a trough level in the third quarter. I was just trying to sense if that's a little bit of an abnormal drop. And - or do see that rates sort of being a good sort of go forward? Joseph Hooley : Let me start that one, Brian. Let me start with your question about - I interpret it as being pipeline and activity in the marketplace, which, as I would say, quite good, quite diversified, proportionately more kind of big deal activities, and as I referenced a minute ago, I think that to me, it stands for firms in the asset management industry that are looking to get more efficient, looking to create more front-to-back straight through processing, and therefore consolidating with fewer providers. There's a - it's rare that these big deals don't happen today without middle office, something that you know well as a component of that, we view that as all quite positive, because the deeper you get into the middle and front office, the more differentiated we are, particularly if you had to that multi-geographies. And therefore pricing - better pricing goes along with that. So I would say that deal activity, deal pipeline quite good. I'd also call your attention to we've got a little bit higher pipeline of deals committed, but not yet installed at just under $400 billion, which we'll roll in over the next 18 months. I'd say that when I add all that up, I look at 4% kind of year-to-date service fee revenue growth, 4% quarter-on-quarter. That feels to me more like a number you should focus on in the quarter itself and the sequential effects of that. And would you had anything to add, Eric? Eric Aboaf : I just add that we do feel good about the momentum of business. We're trying to be clear about that notwithstanding the lumpiness that you get quarter-to-quarter. And so we have some confidence, because we do have some visibility. Obviously, in what's the backlog, what's coming from the pipeline, and so forth. On the fee rate specifically, I'll just remind you that as we add new wins, right, if we add - if we had the custody business for a big firm, and remember we have 40% share in the U.S. asset managers and the mutual fund business, right, if we had a custody and we're adding the accounting, right, you get fees with no incremental AUCA. So you kind of get a positive effect on the fee rate. If instead what we're doing is, if we had half the book and somebody consolidating it, right, and had half of the custody book, and now you're adding the other half of the custody book. You're actually adding both a numerator and a denominator. So there's a lot going on there, which is why I think the fee rate's indicative. But I'll just - it's indicative, but I think there's a lot going on in terms of whether you're expanding new clients, share of wallet with existing clients, and then all the ins and outs of geography and product type. Brian Bedell : And then you mentioned you focus on the profitability, obviously, and improving that. For the some of these new deals that are in the pipeline, and how should we think about the on-boarding expense run rate? Should that be a little bit lumpy and high initially before we get to bring those in or more sort of this the same pattern? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, it's Eric. I think, it depends on the deal sizes. So I think the small and medium sized deals, you kind of just roll into, and there's nothing particularly significant. I think with the larger deals, it depends how they're structured. And so we called out one from the middle of last year, and what regionally came over was literally a lift-out of business activity with rent costs, and people costs, and technology. When you get them that way, you often get them with a TSA, because they literally can't move all the sub-pieces. And so it comes over as a step change. And then what happens is that you then convert from the TSA to the actual line items, right. But as you're doing that, you're effectively digesting. So you might take on 400 people, which is kind of a percentage point of additional headcount. We know that we won't operate it that way in the subsequent years, but that's how we need to take it on. So kind of the bigger the deals, and I guess, we'll describe as we have big deals or - from time-to-time, we'll describe whether there are step changes, I don't think they are - they're enough to disrupt the full year expense growth story, but on a - and kind of trend. But on a quarter - a one quarter basis, there may be a little more or a little less. And so I point to this quarter. Sequentially, we had no growth in expenses when you adjust for currency, right, and that's because there wasn't any big deals just coming in, in a lumpy way. In another quarter, you might easily put in for a percentage point of expense growth, because they were a big enough deal in a particular quarter. And so it's that kind of dynamic or range that we're talking about. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thanks very much. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. I had a one very particular question, one big picture question. But Eric, first, the tax rate dropped off considerably this particular quarter to one of the lowest levels we've seen in several years. The explanation really doesn't talk about discrete benefits, but says it's really mix and energy investment. How would that cause a temporary kind of downdraft? Those things seem more permanent, whereas if you look at the guidance, you're saying it's going to bounce back up to the 30% kind of level? Eric Aboaf : Marty, it's Eric. I've learned to love taxes over the years given how they come in and the lumpiness versus the non-lumpiness. What happens during the year, if you remember, is there are also re-forecasts of expectations with regard to the full year, because you have to set your tax rate based on the full-year expectation of your earnings. And so what happened this quarter is, as we saw more foreign earnings than U.S. earnings in the current quarter and expectations for that to continue into fourth quarter, you effectively have to reset your tax rate to that amount and effectively do a version of what feels like a catch-up. So I think that's probably the best way to explain it, and I'm happy to take a little time off line. But it was - it creates a lumpy catch-up in the particular quarter there. I think on a year-to-date basis, we're running a little north of 29% on the tax rate, and I think we're - we still think we'll end up somewhere around the low end of the range - near the low end of the range that we've described. Marty Mosby : So more of a permanent improvement as you move forward, putting it at the lower end of the range that makes that consistent. And then Jay and Eric, I have a bigger picture question in the sense that there's been a lot of talk over - since the financial crisis and recession that the trust business model was just broken. There was things that were falling off, and that you would never recreate profitability like you did it back in the golden days. If you kind of look at what you're doing, as soon as rates are starting to come off the floor, your returns are returning to, if not the highs, pretty close to that. So you're getting within reach of - now you're well into the middle 13s, 14, 15 is kind of upper end of that range. So you see rates driving you back to that. So was there really anything broke about the model other than just interest rates are really low and now we're getting that benefit back? Joseph Hooley : Yeah, I would say - This is Jay, Marty. I would say that nothing was broke, but a lot has changed. When I think back 10, 12 years, and I look at the upward slope of things like mutual fund flows, ETFs weren't even in the frame yet, I looked at a time when there was a fair amount of revenue generated in the market base revenues, foreign exchange, securities lending, net interest revenue, as you talk about, I think that from then to now, the business of asset servicing, asset ownership has become more challenging. Returns are a little bit more difficult. So as we being a downstream - having downstream effect of that, we've had to change our operating model to be much more focused on creating efficiencies, creating straight-through processing, which - and also moving our business model from the back office to the middle office, heading to the front office, I might add. The value that customers see and what we provide on the servicing side today is much more around the data and analytics, which is why we're investing so deeply into Beacon because it's moving to a place where our ability to aggregate custodian data, inform it with data and analytics allows our customers to compete more effectively. So I think that another backdrop comment I would make is that, if you look at the world as we see it, which is not a North American, but a global world, our estimate is gross assets are growing in the 6%-ish range. So the asset pools are up, but they've shifted from traditional products to ETFs, solutions, all of which requires a higher level of sophisticated technology to support our customers' needs in the future. So I'm as bullish as I've ever been about our prospect and outlook from a standpoint of meeting our financial targets, but the underlying business has changed. And I think it provides a firm like State Street with a clear path to further distinguishing and differentiating ourselves as we move to middle, front office data and analytics informed by Beacon. Marty Mosby : I guess, Jay, what I'm looking at is if you do all those changes what you've done in the operating model and expenses, and then you look at really at the bottom line, 80% of the your bottom line comes from net interest income. So everything else kind of nets out and it reminds me much of what we used to have in mortgage servicing where we did a lot of work. There is a lot of fees. The business always changed, always adapted to that. But at the end of the day, escrow balances was where we got our profitability. So I'm just wondering if at the end of the day that those deposits really are where the value comes and it produces a majority of what you see in the actual pre-tax income. Eric Aboaf : Marty, it's Eric. I'd just be a little cautious about going as far as you're going. But remember, you didn't have a custodial asset. There will be no reason for client to hold deposits with you. If you didn't have a custodial asset, they wouldn't hold your current - foreign currency trade with you. If you didn't have a custodial asset, you couldn't do custody accounting administration, front office data analytics, so highly inter-dependent business. And does how you get paid adjust and evolve over time? Maybe, but our perspective I think is we should make sure we need - we understand well how we get paid in that business and make sure we get paid fairly. I think you saw returns on equity north of 13% this quarter, you've seen us do that a couple of quarters here. Return on tangible common equity, which is a traditional bank measure is like in the 19% range. I mean, pretty - I don't know what the golden era was like that you refer to, but it's pretty attractive returns for an institution here with very nice EPS growth. Marty Mosby : Now, on you returning to those golden age kind of return is what I was getting at as all it took was rates. But, yeah, I appreciate the time you spent on it. We'll talk about it little bit more offline. Eric Aboaf : Good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Thanks, guys. Just one quick one here. Just on the servicing, maybe the overall relationship. Thanks for the color on the quarter, just on the products and asset classes. But it does seem like the clients are under more pressure, whether it's them facing fee pressure, new regulations. I just wanted to get an update like when you think about the other like offerings that you have, we look at one line item, but obviously you can generate revenues in other areas. So I don't know if you have any update on how that shifted over time with the clients, the number of products and services that are being used. And then probably most importantly, given what you guys are doing on Beacon, like the incremental margin on clients today versus maybe three or four years ago before you went down this path, just so we can kind of get more of a holistic view versus just the one part of the business. Joseph Hooley : Yeah, Mike, this is Jay. Thanks for the question, the - it's a good question, because in addition to the traditional packaging in the servicing business of accounting and custody, augmented by foreign exchange, trading and securities lending, more recently Enhanced Custody. I would say the package has been enhanced recently with - I mentioned, middle-office, which is where almost 24 years into middle-office, we were the pioneers and still the market leader by a long stretch. As clients, as you rightly point out are faced with more pressure. There is more consolidation of providers, but the value they see is, now into the middle-office, our ability to aggregate custodian data and provide them a platform for front-office analytics. All the other stuff are still relevant, with the trading, the lending. But increasingly, the value proposition is in that middle and front office data aggregation, which is why we talk about Beacon. And rightly, we're all focused on Beacon as an efficiency play, but it's much, much more than that to the extent that we can get our data, the $32 trillion in assets that we hold on behalf of clients or a specific client normalize, made available on a real-time basis, aggregate it with other custodian's data. It's a huge differentiator. And so, I think that that's what we're playing for and we think that long-term the big global asset manager is going to look for partners like that that can span global locations, that can move from the back office to the middle office, into the front office, all the while keeping all those other revenue pools intact, the trading, the securities lining and Enhanced Custody. Eric Aboaf : And, Mike, it's Eric. I'd just add that to support that effort and those trends and those - that progress, we have fairly intense performance measurement that we do, sort of number of products, number of products per client for asset managers versus pension funds versus insurers. And we actually shared some of that at the early September conference just so you have a little bit of kind of tactical feel, but we generally think about 30 products or so that are out there that we offer. And the performance measurement gets us at that level so we can target and grow kind of at that level. Michael Carrier : Okay, thanks a lot. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Jay, Eric. I want to get back to the servicing fee question. So if you look at constant currency versus year to date, in 2Q you were running at about 5% growth year on year. Now, you're running, again, constant currency year to date about 4% and you said you're comfortable with that. So there's been a little bit of slowdown there. What is causing that? Is there something, can you give some color on that? And what gets us to be - what's causing the slowdown and what gets us comfortable that it's staying at 4% and not going a little bit slower? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Vivek, it's Eric. I think I just caution on individual quarters just like I would on individual months, because you got a fair number of small things going on. You got accruals, which are occasionally little lumpy. You've got new business that you install and which kind of has to tip in. You may have an old deal that is winding down that comes out. So - or a little - we just want to give a little caution to a particular quarter's results. And if you think about the little lumpiness that you might get in one quarter, if that lumpiness went the other way in the previous quarter, then you kind of get a little more than you might expect, which is I think what happened this quarter, so just a little kind of cautionary note to take it in perspective. In terms of why we had some confidence for the fourth quarter and the year is, we put aside new business pipelines, but we have a backlog of business that needs to be installed and when it gets installed, we begin to accrue for. We obviously have good visibility into that. And so, that's off of which we're doing some of our modeling and off of which we gave guidance for fourth quarter. And we think that will play through. Vivek Juneja : So, Eric, keeping that in mind, do you think we're better off going back to where you were running first half of the year? Or is that too fine - cutting it too fine to go from where that's four or it's five or is there some kind of range in that - between those two? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, I'd keep it in the range. This is a business that you win over quarters that become years, that become multiple years. You saw what year-on-year was 1Q, year-over-year 2Q, year-over-year 3Q. I think the year-to-date is a good indication and is our expectation for - is our expectation. Vivek Juneja : And the FX swaps, Eric, for you, that you mentioned earlier that caused some of that impact on the deposit costs, was that because of the weakness in the dollar versus the pound or the euro or any color on that? Eric Aboaf : No, the FX swaps and the reason why the FX swaps which are linked from an accounting standpoint to the deposit, cost more in the third quarter than the second quarter is because the interest rate differential, right, between U.S. markets and European markets. And so as the Fed moved, but the ECB did not move, the cost of the swap goes up. That said, when you invest in dollars you can invest at higher rates than you did in euros, and so it neutralizes, but the accounting shows it on two different lines. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : So now, you mentioned earlier that you were reducing the credit securities and adding direct loans. Can you just size what the ultimate goal is of that strategy and the timing of it as well? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Brian, it's Eric. We're gliding the balance sheet. I think you saw us glide a bit on deposits in a very purposeful way and we think that that's accretive to ratios and for the annual stress tests. And then on the asset side, on the investment portfolio side, I think you've seen that we have a kind of broad diversified mix of securities. You've seen us adjust by about $2 billion, $3 billion this quarter. And we have a capacity to continue to do some of that to the extent that we want to create room. I think if you step back, what we're trying to do here is optimize multiple ratios, right? Right now, tier 1 leverage is the binding constraint, since you see a lot of activity there. As tier 1 leverage becomes less of a binding constraint, then we have to think about the SLR constraint and the RWA constraint. And what you see us do is in a kind of in a forward thinking way, begin to tailor the balance sheet for those as well. So I think I describe the investment portfolio as a modest adjustment. We have the capacity to do more because we have a little more of a high quality, credit-intensive portfolio than others. And if there's good client business to be done and we want to grow that a little more quickly, it's a natural part to say should we do both or should we offset a little bit. I tell you, both changes are accretive on earnings and both are positive in our stress testing and so that's - that was some of the logic and something we'll continue to work on and refine. Brian Kleinhanzl : And just a second question, yeah, I heard you mention the impacts of the sale of BlockCross on the processing fees, but didn't hear the dollar amount. Did you give the gains on that sale? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, the pre-tax gain was just around $25 million and it's in one of the footnotes. The - what I will remind you is it's in processing fees, which this quarter we're $145 million. A year ago, processing fees were $139 million, so there is - that's the fee line where we have lots of small items. We have software fees. We have loan fees. We have BOLI. We have tax-advantaged investments. It's a little lumpy. But - so BlockCross didn't have a significant move on a year on year basis. It does have a - it is, it does have a pre-tax effect in an absolute way in the current quarter though. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good, thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks? Joseph Hooley : Yeah, just quickly, Victoria. Thanks everybody for your time. And good questions this morning and we look forward to getting together in January to discuss our fourth quarter results. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Today's discussion is being broadcast live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website.  Now I'd like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at State Street. Please go ahead. Ilene Bieler : Thank you, Nora. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include operating basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 4Q '17 slide presentation.  In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today in our 4Q '17 slide presentation under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change.  Now let me turn it over to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Thanks, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen today, we ended 2017, which is our 225th year, with strong operating results reflecting momentum across our asset servicing and asset management businesses and continued strength in equity markets as we advance our digital leadership. As you're also aware, although we think tax reform will have a significant positive for us going forward, it did result in a onetime net impact in the quarter related mostly to deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, partially offset by the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities, which we'll go into shortly in the presentation.  Right now, we will be discussing our business performance on an operating basis, which excludes the onetime tax impacts. Fourth quarter and full year results included strong EPS growth and improved return on equity. We continue to see momentum across our core franchise. Strength in equity markets and new business lifted our assets under custody and administration to record levels at year-end with growth of 15% from the end of 2016 to $33.1 trillion. We achieved new servicing commitments of $445 billion in the fourth quarter 2017 and $800 billion for the year. Our total new business yet to be installed at quarter end was $350 billion, which was roughly the same as last quarter. And importantly, new business opportunities remain robust across the franchise.  State Street Global Advisors finished the year with record assets under management of $2.8 trillion, up 13% from 2016 year-end, driven by strength in equity markets, follow-on wins from the acquired GE Asset Management business and higher-yielding ETF inflows of $28 billion. Furthermore, 2017 results reflect success in realizing the benefits from State Street Beacon, our multiyear program to digitize our business, enhance our client experiences and gain efficiencies. Importantly, as a result of the efforts we have made to expand and accelerate Beacon, we now expect to complete the Beacon program and realize the related financial objectives by mid-2019, 18 months ahead of schedule.  Now turning to Slide #5, I'd like to review some of our key achievements for the year. I'm very pleased with our performance this year as we achieved or exceeded all of our 2017 financial objectives. Fee revenue growth of 8% was driven by continued market appreciation and new client business, enabling us to exceed our fee revenue target for 2017 by a healthy margin. We remain committed to expense control as evidenced by full year positive fee operating leverage of 2.1% and Beacon expense savings of approximately $150 million. Net interest income growth of 14% exceeded our financial goal for the year by 8 percentage points as we actively managed our balance sheet. We also achieved a pretax operating margin of 31.4%, surpassing our 200 -- 2018 Beacon target 1 year ahead of schedule.  These results demonstrate our commitment to achieving our financial goals, advancing our digital leadership through Beacon and continuing to drive growth in our business by creating new product solutions to support our clients. We delivered full year EPS growth of 25% and improved return on equity by 210 basis points to 12.9%. And during 2017, through share repurchase and common share dividends, we returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders. Beyond the achievement of our financial goals in 2017, we marked our 225th anniversary with employees and clients around the world, celebrated the 40th anniversary of our foundation, and with Fearless Girl, State Street Global Advisors advanced an important agenda to achieve greater stewardship and diversity in our industry and beyond.  Before I turn the call over to Eric to review our financial performance for the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2018, let me take a moment to talk through the recent tax reform change and how we will deploy some of the benefits. The majority of the benefits will flow through our financials and result in higher earnings. We are targeting a small percentage of the gain toward 3 specific initiatives that will benefit our employees and the communities where we live and work.  First, we'll invest in an employee retirement plan by enhancing the matching contributions from -- for our defined contribution plans. Second, we will introduce new technology and content to provide employees a customized learning experience to build the skills they need for future success. And third, we will increase our State Street foundation matching gift benefit for employees and increase our global grantmaking to support the communities in which we live and work.  And with that, Eric, over to you. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our 2017 results, I'd like to take a moment on Page 6 to discuss notable items in 4Q '17 and 4Q '16 and the related impact on our financials. In 4Q '17, we recognized $270 million of onetime tax cost and revenue adjustments based on estimates associated with tax reform. The primary impact from our GAAP basis results include a repatriation tax expense of $454 million, which was partially offset by a tax benefit of $197 million associated with the revaluation of our net deferred tax liability due to lower future tax rates. We also had a revenue reduction of approximately $20 million associated with a onetime accelerated amortization of tax-advantaged investments. Together, this resulted in a 30 basis point impact to CET1 and a 15 basis point reduction on Tier 1 leverage.  Just to remind you, a year ago, our 4Q '16 results included a tax benefit of $211 million and the acceleration of incentive compensation expense of $161 million. The net effect of these 2 items was a benefit of $50 million in the year-ago quarter.  Now please turn to Slide 7, where I'll start my review of our operating basis results for 2017. Overall, full year 2017 results were driven by client fee revenue momentum and increase in net interest income supported by higher U.S. interest rates coupled with disciplined pricing as well as a continued focus on prudently managing expenses while reinvesting in the business.  Key performance metrics for full year 2017, excluding the impact of tax legislation and last year's items that I just mentioned, are as follows : EPS increased 25% to $6.41 a share, supported by fee revenue growth of 8% and NII growth of 14%. ROE increased 2.1 percentage points to 12.9%, now nicely in our targeted range. Positive fee operating leverage came in at 2.1 percentage points. Pretax operating basis margin reached 31.4%, which is now ahead of our 2018 Beacon target of 31%.  Turning to 4Q '17. EPS of $1.83 increased 36% from a year-ago quarter, driven by strength in servicing and management fees and higher net interest income. Return on equity for the quarter measurably improved to 14.1%, up 2.7 percentage points. Just like last quarter, 4Q '17 results also benefit from a lower-than-expected tax rate of 27%, primarily due to the higher share of lower tax foreign earnings and benefits related to stock-based compensation, which was worth approximately $0.07 per share.  Now let me turn to Slide 8 to briefly review growth of 2 key drivers. Business momentum continued in 4Q '17 in both AUCA and AUM. Record AUCA of $33.1 trillion at year-end increased 15% from 4Q '16. Growth was primarily driven by a combination of market appreciation and client activity. Flows were particularly strong in EMEA and middle-office outsourcing.  At State Street Global Advisors, AUM increased 13% from 4Q '16, driven by market appreciation and higher-yielding ETF inflows, partially offset from lower-yielding institutional mandates during the year. Our new low-cost ETF offering added $5 billion of inflows in just 3 months. These 4Q '17 levels in both AUCA and AUM position us well for 2018. Please turn to Slide 9, where I will cover 4Q '17 fee revenue results on a year-over-year basis. You'll also find additional detail in the appendix with the sequential quarter comparison to 3Q '17.  Total fee revenue increased 6% from 4Q '16, driven by strength in asset servicing, asset management and securities finance fees. Servicing fees increased 7% from 4Q '16, reflecting higher global equity markets, broad-based new business wins and the benefit of a declining dollar, partially offset by modest hedge fund outflows. Management fees again demonstrated strong growth in 4Q '17, increasing 16% relative to the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher global equity markets and higher revenue-yielding ETF inflows, including $28 billion in 4Q '17 alone. Compared to 4Q '16, both servicing and management fees benefited from the weaker U.S. dollar, as we outlined in the table below.  Trading services revenue decreased from 4Q '16, primarily due to lower volatility as well as a modest impact from the businesses we exited in 2017, partially offset by higher client FX volumes. Securities finance fees increased from 4Q '16, primarily due to higher client volumes in both our agency and enhanced custody businesses, partially offset by lower spreads. Moving to Slide 10. NII was up 20% and NIM increased 31 basis points from 4Q '16. NII benefited from higher U.S. interest rates, disciplined liability pricing and loan growth, partially offset by a smaller balance sheet.  U.S. dollar interest-bearing client deposit betas remained relatively low around 25% when compared to 4Q '16. As I've previously commented, we expect deposit betas to increase over time as they have in past cycles.  Relative to 3Q '17, noninterest-bearing deposit balances declined only slightly, while interest-bearing deposit balances remained relatively flat. U.S. dollar interest-bearing client deposit costs increased by only 2 basis points sequentially. Notable in our financial supplement, you'll see a decrease in our non-U.S. domiciled interest-bearing deposits and a corresponding increase to the U.S. domiciled interest-bearing deposits. This was the result of a transfer of approximately $14 billion of foreign-denominated Cayman branch deposits. The transfer had no impact to our deposit rate paid. Overall, we continue to price deposits carefully in order to manage the size of our balance sheet while providing the necessary value to our servicing clients.  Now I will turn to Slide 11 to review 4Q '17 expenses. Expenses increased 4% on an ex-FX basis from 4Q '16, excluding the acceleration of compensation expense a year ago, which I mentioned earlier in my remarks. The increase was driven by new business activity, merited incentive and additional investments in technology, partially offset by Beacon-related savings and lower professional services costs. Compensation and employee benefits increased from a year-ago quarter, primarily due to increased costs to support new business, annual merited incentive comp and the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar, partially offset by Beacon savings.  Information systems, transaction processing and occupancy costs increased as a result of new business activity and technology-related investments. Other expenses decreased from 4Q '16, primarily reflecting lower professional services costs.  4Q '17 GAAP results also included a pretax $133 million Beacon restructuring charge, which will provide payback on average within the next 7 quarters. Program to-date, Beacon-related restructuring charges now total about $385 million at December 31, 2017. Let me now move to Slide 12 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. Starting on the right side of the slide, we achieved $150 million in Beacon savings in 2017, including $50 million in 4Q. This exceeded our 2017 target by $10 million. We now expect an additional $150 million in savings in 2018, and we now expect our previously targeted $550 million in aggregate savings to be realized 18 months ahead of schedule by the middle of 2019.  Shifting over to the left side of the slide, I will briefly touch upon notable achievements we have realized since the inception of Beacon. We continue to digitize how we receive and process data from clients and use speed as a way to differentiate our service. Key accomplishments include improving efficiencies from advancing our global accounting platform and creating a global workforce to service clients 24 hours a day. We've also expanded Beacon to our asset management and corporate divisions, including procurement and real estate, and we expect to build further traction on these areas as we move forward.  Now let's turn to Slide 13 to review our balance sheet and capital position. We continue to maintain a high-quality balance sheet. Our capital ratios remain healthy, which enabled us to return capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases, including buying back $350 million of common stock and declaring a common share dividend of $0.42 in 4Q.  We ended the year strong, with our common equity Tier 1 ratio up 30 basis points from last quarter and last year, even with the impact related to the recently enacted tax law. Notably, you can see that our Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 80 basis points from last December to 7.3%, which positions us well for this year's CCAR.  Turning to Slide 14. Let me touch upon notable items that will impact our financials going forward. First, let me start with the impact of the tax law change. We expect, based on our current guidance, our 2018 GAAP basis effective tax rate to be approximately 16%. This reflects a 4% to 5% benefit to our core tax rate, which I would define primarily as federal, state and foreign tax rates combined, resulting in a 2018 benefit of approximately $150 million.  As Jay commented in his remarks, while the large majority of the benefits from the enacted tax law will be realized by our shareholders, we are putting key initiatives in place to share some of the benefits with employees and the communities in which we operate.  Next, starting in 2018, on a prospective basis, the new FASB revenue recognition standard takes effect, in which certain costs previously presented on a net basis will now be presented on a gross basis. We expect the revenue recognition standard to impact both revenue and expenses by about $225 million.  Lastly, moving to the bottom of the slide, we will now be presenting our financials on an operating basis in 2018. We will provide a primarily GAAP basis presentation. We will continue, however, to present certain non-GAAP measures such as pretax margin as well as call out additional notable items such as acquisition and restructuring costs in line with industry practice. This should offer investors a more streamlined presentation with enhanced clarity. Now please turn to Slide 15, where I will discuss our 2018 financial outlook. In 2018, we remain focused on continuing our revenue momentum, investing in our business to drive growth in our core franchise and deliver additional capabilities to our clients while at the same time prudently managing expenses, including executing on Beacon. On this page, you can see on the left an illustrative 2018 operating basis outlook on a like-for-like basis for 2017, which excludes the impact of the revenue recognition standard I just mentioned as well as the impact from the changes in the tax law. We're providing this view because we believe we continue to have strong momentum in the business and expect to deliver on our Beacon pretax margin goal that was made on this basis.  In the right column, you can see our 2018 outlook as we intend to present it going forward on a GAAP basis, which factors in the new revenue recognition standard, the new tax law and addresses the 2017 gains on sale. On a GAAP basis, considering the gains on sale, we expect 2018 fee revenue to increase 7% to 8%. We are assuming good equity market growth as well as continued low volatility trading commissions. The primary difference between the historical operating basis fee growth outlook of 4% to 5% and our 2018 outlook is the impact from revenue recognition standard plus a small impact from the changing tax equivalent [indiscernible]. We expect positive fee operating leverage of 75 to 150 basis points considering the gains on sale in 2017 that I mentioned. I would also note that fee operating leverage will vary by quarter. We are committed to calibrating expenses against the revenue backdrop over the course of the year.  Turning to NII. We expect NII to grow within a range of 10% to 13%, reflecting higher expected interest rates in the U.S. Balance sheet growth in 2018 will largely depend on new business and related client deposit activity.  Lastly, we expect the GAAP basis tax rate to be approximately 16% in 2018, which, as I mentioned, reflects a 4 to 5 point improvement over our core GAAP tax rate, which is the $150 million benefit I referenced. To help clarify the differences between the historical operating basis outlook and GAAP basis outlook, we have also included Page 19 in the appendix, which has a reconciliation between the old operating basis and GAAP basis outlook for your reference.  Now a word on first quarter. We expect first quarter 2018 to be broadly in line with this full year guidance. But let me remind you that as in previous years, 1Q '18 compensation and benefits expense will be seasonally higher due to the effects of the accounting treatment of equity compensation from retirement-eligible employees as well as payroll taxes.  Finally, to Page 16. In summary, we are very pleased with our 2017 results. Strong 2017 results including -- included operating basis EPS growth of 25% as well as returning $2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchases.  Strength in our asset servicing and asset management businesses and a focus on calibrating expenses against the revenue backdrop enabled us to achieve our 2017 financial objectives, including generating approximately 200 basis points in positive fee operating leverage.  Importantly, we continue to invest in our businesses to enhance client experience. We also achieved our 2017 Beacon-related savings target and now expect to realize the full program benefits 18 months ahead of schedule. As we look forward to this year, we are well positioned to achieve our 2018 financial objectives and key strategic priorities, including advancing our digital leadership while controlling expenses and delivering on behalf of clients.  And with that, let me turn it back over to Jay. Joseph Hooley : Thanks, Eric. And Nora, I think we can now open the call to questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Thanks for all the additional color, obviously, and the -- and trying to streamline the reporting. I think it's definitely very helpful as we kind of try to compare you guys against the industry, so appreciate that. I guess, along those lines, Eric, a question for you around the margins. I guess if we look at the new reporting, some more kind of under GAAP basis, excluding any significant charges, State Street's pretax margin is in the high 20s, kind of 28%, 29%, obviously, with some room for improvement given Beacon initiatives still. But when we look at the peers, the margins there, again, on a similar basis, look to be in the low to mid-30s, and I just wanted to get your take on, a, either do you see anything structural about State Street's business that prevents you guys from getting closer to those kind of industry averages. And if not, where do you see the margins going over time once kind of all the Beacon savings are in the run rate? Eric Aboaf : Alex, appreciate the question. It's Eric. On margins, I think a couple different parts to the answer to your question. I think, first, we're pleased with where we came in on margins for the quarter and the year. Those are ahead of our Beacon expectations by a full year. And I think we're confident that as part of the outlook we gave, margins should continue to trend up in a positive direction, and that's certainly part of the business model that we've designed when it comes to top line revenue, fee operating leverage and benefits in NII. In terms of comparisons, the comparisons are kind of -- have a good-sized range. And part of that is, as you probably know well, the tax-advantaged investments which go through the GAAP line have varying effects on margins for different companies, partly based on how much they do in the tax-advantaged investments and partly because there are a couple of different ways to account for them. And I just encourage you to factor that in into the comparisons. I think if you do -- we show that we're within the range. I think from a perspective of should we be at the high, middle or lower end of the range, business mix matters, U.S., international, more middle office versus the Class A custody operations, having asset management or not. So I'm not overly fussed with where we are in the range. I think with the view that we are -- we're within it and our perspective is margin is one of the key indicators of our business and our expectation is that it should continue to widen over time. Alexander Blostein : Got it. And then second question around NII, just some clarification, I guess. Your comment around deposit betas in the U.S., I think you said about 20%, still seems pretty low, again, relative to what we heard from some of the others so far. Is there something, again, structural about State Street's business that's keeping it that way? Is there something that you guys doing proactively to keep it this low? And as we think about your commentary on the forward, should it be more over-ramped or could we see a bit more of a catch-up on the deposit costs because you guys have done absolutely quite a good job maintaining that at a fairly low level? Eric Aboaf : Yes, let me first reemphasize, what we've said over the last couple of quarters and what I just said in the call summary is that our deposit betas have ranged about 25% over the last year, right? So that's kind of the current state. And a couple of quarters back, it was at the -- a bit lower than that, and that's where we're at today. I think what we factored into our outlook is a continued uptick in deposit betas. I think we've seen that around the industry. We've seen that in corporate deposits quite a bit. We've seen that in wealth management deposits. We've seen some of that in custody deposits. While we think custody deposit betas will tend to be somewhat less than some of the other price-oriented deposit categories that I just mentioned, deposit betas have to rise over time. They have to rise into next year. We don't think they rise -- well, I guess, we say they just are going to rise, and the question is a little bit of how much and how fast. And part of the reason we put an NII range in place in the outlook is to accommodate that uptick that we expect. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : For my first one, just to follow up on Alex's question there on NII from a different direction. So we saw the balance sheet decline again this quarter, although slower pace than last quarter. Could you maybe let us know how much of a balance sheet growth or decline you have reflected in your outlook for NII growth and whether or not the rate rises are only in the U.S. or whether or not you might have some tailwinds from that in Europe, U.K. as well? Eric Aboaf : Glenn (sic) [ Bren ], it's Eric. Let me start with the back end of the question. I think the rate rises that we've expected in the outlook are primarily in the U.S. I think we're clear that -- about 3 are expected. There was a rate rise in sterling in the fourth quarter, which has already started to factor into the 4Q results that we just released and obviously will help next year in 2018. But for the time being, we haven't expected much more in sterling or euros, and I think that's consistent with the forwards. In terms of balance sheet size, we made a conscious effort several years back and then reemphasized that over the last year to just run a -- what I'll describe as a compact and efficient balance sheet. I think you saw us deliver on our objectives for this past year. I think at this point, we feel confident in the size of our balance sheet. You could see the capital ratios and leverage ratio, in particular, are at a nice place, which gives us the room we'd like. I think our pricing is fair, and we'll continue to share some of the benefits of rate rises with clients as they'd expect. And so there's a range in the NII guidance, and part of that range accommodates some of the range that we might have in deposit betas, some amount of range in balance sheet growth. I think the balance sheet at one end could be roughly around where we are today. It could grow modestly. I don't think there's anything -- there's going to be any dramatic shifts, but there's a range of outcomes, and we're just preparing for that range. Brennan Hawken : That's fair, that's fair. And then second question, you made reference to capital and how you feel quite good about things, Eric. How should we think about potential for capital relief? We've heard in the press that regulators are preparing to moderate leverage ratio calculations and requirements. Is there a way in which you could help investors frame that potential relief and how that would translate into capital return policies at State Street? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Glenn (sic) [ Bren ]. We're clearly optimistic like others around regulatory reform and refinements here with the current administration. And we're pleased to see both movement in the agencies, the Treasury Department, in Congress around leverage ratios and some of the other constraints that are important to us, including some of the most recent announcements of -- and intentions. I don't think we can translate that, though, into direct action that quickly until we see what might come out. I mean, part of the question will be, is it supplementary leverage ratio? Is it leverage ratio? Is it CCAR that changes? Which part? Which one? I think the -- we recently saw that there are 22 capital rules out there and ratios. And I think you all can feel that just like we can. So I think hard to translate it directly. I think we're optimistic that we'll see some changes. What we'll need to work through is if we have changes in one ratio, the question is, is that ratio a binding constraint? Or can we find a way to expand in a certain manner that is -- that's offered to us in that way. So hard to tell. Apologies, I can't answer that until we see more. But I think when we see more, we'll be able to give you more background, Bren. Joseph Hooley : And Bren, this is Jay. Just as we saw the regulatory rules come in on kind of a slow basis, I think they're going to go out on a slow basis. I think what is overwhelmingly clear, though, is that the trend is positive. The leverage ratio, which is front and center for the trust banks, has gotten special attention, I think, from our good efforts. And as you probably know, there's a bill working its way through the Senate, which is a broader banking bill which has in it some relief for the trust banks around leverage ratio. So I think the trend is quite clear, but it's going to take longer than any of us would hope to get some of this regulatory -- the regulatory adjustments implemented. Operator : Another question from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : I just wanted to ask you just on the spending side. It's great to see you guys accelerating the recognition of the Beacon saves. And embedded within, I guess, the operating leverage is still a pretty healthy rate of cost growth. And I'm just wondering, can you help us understand how much of that -- is any of that a pull forward layered against the pull forward on the Beacon saves? And how much of it is putting a little bit of the tax benefits back into the business? And just where do you think you are on just kind of tax spend needs versus your prior thoughts and any changes because of the tax changes? Joseph Hooley : Ken, let me start that, this is Jay, and then I'll turn it over to Eric. I've always believed -- we've always believed that you need to spend in this business to continue to drive the revenue line. And in addition to Beacon, we're still making some pretty steady investments. They tend to be technology-oriented. I'll just give you some flavor for that. We've talked before about the investments we've made in our ETF platform, which are paying great benefits as we compete in the servicing of the ETF world. Most recently, we just finished off a Japanese accounting system and we just brought our first Japanese mutual fund account onto the system in the fourth quarter. We think that's a robust future opportunity. I guess the last one I might spike -- the last couple I might spike out would be, Eric referenced the European offshore markets, which continue to run at great speed, and we're the recipient of that. We're the largest provider of services in places like Luxembourg and Dublin. And we have embarked recently on an investment in our transfer agent platform, which was a differentiated -- we continue to differentiate ourselves when we compete for new business and serve existing customers. On the regulatory front, the MiFID rules recently and even more recently, SEC modernization have caused us to spend money to put in place administrative platforms. So there's a fair amount of spending that goes on, and we think that's a good thing. That's going to serve our clients well, get in front of opportunities in the market, which, to us, look like growth opportunities. So that's where the spend comes. I'll let Eric pick up on the Beacon saves and some of the other offsets. Eric Aboaf : Yes, it's Eric. I'll just add that we've been careful and I think considerate in how we operate the business. So within the revenue growth envelope that we had this year, which had revenues in the 7%, 8%, a little higher than we would typically had expected, we had expense growth of about 4%, adjusted for FX. And if you think about what drives that, there's a couple of percent, call it, 2% for net new business, there's -- as we onboard clients. There's a couple percent, call it, 2% for merited incentive that we have. There's a couple percent, again, call it 2%, just to keep it simple, but it's literally how the map works for technology and some of those business investments that Jay described. And then there's a couple points that go the other way, right, in Beacon savings. And you add that together -- and it's actually a good business system and it lets us both do the right thing by our business and our clients and also work within the operating leverage that we'd like to deliver. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. Okay. And then just one quick one, just on core business flows and transaction activity. I think you mentioned that hedge fund outflows continue to be slightly negative. Can you just give us a flavor for that activity inflows component of hedge fund emerging market and how that trended sequentially and if you've seen any stabilization ahead? Joseph Hooley : Yes, let me -- I'll take it more broadly, Ken, and then I'll get into hedge funds. The flow -- the direction of flows may remain pretty constant in the fourth quarter. So you've got the rapid ETF inflows. You've got the U.S. mutual fund outflows. We're in the middle of both of those. I mentioned the -- in Europe, the European -- particular focus on the offshore markets, and you can see the numbers if you look them up, they're quite robust. In the alternative world, you ask about hedge, and you've seen throughout 2017, the hedge outflows have moderated. In fact, there were some quarters where there was even a hint of inflows. And we're largely seeing that. We've seen still a little bit on the outflow side but considerably diminished from '16 to '17. And we're hopeful with the outflows that have occurred that we've reached the trough. We even see some -- more recently, some new fund introductions on the hedge fund world, which is a positive sign. So I'm not declaring a turn yet, but the trend is pretty positive. Eric Aboaf : I'd just add, over the past year, we've seen the servicing fee line on hedge fund outflows cost us more than a percentage point of growth. We're still seeing some of that in the fourth quarter. We expect to see some of that into next year. And the question is when does it balance out, stabilize fully in turn, but -- though we've seen some improvements. But it's still there, and we're just obviously navigating through it, and you see some positives from some of the other parts of the franchise, which Jay described, as offsetting that, which I think gave us some good overall results on the servicing fee line this quarter. Operator : Another question from the line of Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Maybe a first question in enhanced custody prime brokerage lends. Curious how you would define where enhanced custody begins and ends versus prime brokerage, and then as I've seen some competitors dabble in certain asset classes like doing FX prime brokerage, how you think about the different asset classes and where State Street's aspirations might go there. Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it's Eric. I think it's a good question because it's an area that clearly we've expanded into in the last couple of years. We think as a custody provider where we have -- where hedge funds have their assets with us, it actually provides a platform by which we can provide a portion of the classic prime brokerage services directly for them. I don't think there are any bright lines as to where we play versus where some of the traditional broker-dealers play. I mean, they start from a position oftentimes of having to borrow collateral to lend it, right? So in a way, they start with a 2-sided model. We have the collateral -- or we have our client's collateral sitting right there, which helps facilitate that and it gives us some advantages. It gives us some advantages with some of the '40 Act or some of the clients we already serve. But it's a good-sized market. I think we are -- we continue to explore how to both strategically and tactically compete. In our perspective, it's been attractive, and we just need to make sure we balance some of the capital rules, some of which may change over time, which could be beneficial with how we go to market. Glenn Schorr : So no need for further technology bill that's more of the -- is it an ROE accretive event? Eric Aboaf : Well, it's -- actually, it's an area where we've invested in the technology years ago. I think that's what, in a way, got our business off the ground is we were able to access from -- directly from the custody system and what our clients already had with us. So we created that access. Over time, it's been -- and I think we've described it as 9 or 10 systems that you have to actually pull together and we've actually integrated a good part of that. It's one of the areas where we've actually developed some blockchain technology to actually connect the lenders and the lending pools that are either in our asset management or away from us in the market to our custody system. And so it's an area which I think continues to have developments technologically, and we're finding that clients are quite pleased and respond so accordingly with the business that they've brought our way. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. Just a follow-up on the fee operating leverage conversation. I think the year-on-year numbers impacted just because of tough comps in the fourth quarter last year but for the full year is really good. But I did notice that your target went from, I think, 100 to 200 of fee operating leverage to 75 to 150. Is that just it's harder to do as margins have moved up? Or maybe that leads into Ken's past question on are you accelerating some of the investments? Eric Aboaf : I wouldn't read anything in particular into that, to be honest. I think, this past year, we had both a strong view as to what we could do on the expense side, and I think we saw early on that markets were going to be quite favorable. If we have that kind of favorability again, I mean, that'd be great to have, and if you can assure us, we'd take it. But it's -- we're trying to be, I think, careful and vigilant that in a way, we don't want to overestimate what the market will do and sort of say, look, then the top range should be higher and higher and higher. I think we actually want to run a conservative business model as we have been over the last couple of years and have realistic expectations of revenues and then make sure that we both invest and save at the same time. So I wouldn't read anything into it. I think where we are at the 75 to 150 is kind of where we're comfortable. I think it's where -- it's a good range for the last few years. And I think it's at least an indication of where we're going to be running the business this year and likely going forward. Operator : Another question from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One, on the NIM side, I know we discussed the deposit angle. I'm just wondering, Eric, as you're thinking about reinvesting, is there any interest in maybe going a little bit longer duration and picking up some yield that way? Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it's Eric. We're always reassessing our positioning against rates and -- in the market. We certainly do that across the curve as you're suggesting. We do that in dollars, sterling, euro, yen and so forth. I think if you look carefully, our duration expanded a little bit this quarter as an example. I don't think it's a trend, but it's an example. We've seen some steeper curves in euro and sterling and given that we have good-sized deposit basis there, it's natural for us to take advantage of that. And so we've done that a bit. But I think we also want to be careful and keep the front end of the curve position open so that as rates rise, they come up. So I don't think you should expect some large changes in positioning. But that's an example of the, I think, the tactical adjustments that we make and we'll continue to make and look for opportunities accordingly. Betsy Graseck : And as we're thinking -- and we' just had a little bit of discussion on Europe as well, I realize that you're baking in the forward curve. Just wondering, given some investor in kind of discussion around inflation and global inflation, will that pick up. What -- can you just remind us if the European rate structure were to move up 25 bps, let's say, beyond what the forwards are currently estimating, what that impact is on your financials? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think the best way to describe it is, and we've tried to share the basis of the balance sheet, but we described in the -- in our Qs and Ks that we're open to interest rates, right, on a -- and we say about half of that's in the U.S., half of that is non-U.S. The value of a 25-point move in the U.S. has been in the $20 million to $25 million range, kind of the last -- over the last year, I think. More currently, it's going to be in the $10 million to $15 million range. But it's -- these are ranges, right? And given that, that is half of our exposure, if there's a 25 basis-point move instantly in euros, you'd expect something in that order of magnitude, well it have to be euros and sterling because I'd say half our balance sheet is U.S., half non-U.S. But I think you could probably build off of that, would be an indication. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly on the tax guidance that you've got on the forward look. Nice decline there, when we penciled it out, I think we had a slightly larger decline and obviously, you have more information than I do. I'm just wondering if this tax rate outlook for 2018 is similar to what you're thinking 2019, 2020 is? Or is there any migration in your structure that would drive different tax rate outlook for 2019? And could you also discuss a little bit about the BEAT and whether there or not there is any impacts on you? Eric Aboaf : Betsy, you've asked a sort of tough question. We'll give you the award of the call for that. Here's how I'd say it. The tax law is new. I think we've had every tax expert here and around the world trying to work through it, understand the implications for us. We've made -- we're confident in our good estimates at this point for 2018. And we don't see large movements going forward from then, but I think it's just too early to tell. And as we learn more, we'll certainly share that with you. But I think we're confident that there's a nice $150 million benefit in '18. That's going to fall primarily to the bottom line and shareholders. And as we learn more, we'll certainly share that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So is this tax outlook for '18 more -- like your other guidance conservative? Would that be a fair statement or... Eric Aboaf : Our guidance is our guidance. We're trying to be appropriate in how we characterize our expectations. And hopefully, that's a good bit for you to work off of. Operator : Another question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Maybe, I don't think you've mentioned it, but can you discuss what your equity market assumption is on the fee income line? And if that also includes BlackRock in that equation? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it's Eric. Are you asking about the outlook? Or are you asking about the '17 results? James Mitchell : No, I'm sorry. I'm looking in your 4% to 5% guidance range for the fee income. Just wanting to see what your equity assumption is? And what your assumption is around the loss of the BlackRock contract? Eric Aboaf : Yes, see, here's how I'd -- what we've incorporated. We've incorporated basically all the known market expectations and client activity. So we have market expectations of where we have market knowledge where we are today on equity markets and fixed income markets and both are important to our book of business. And there is some consensus there will be some continued growth, we've factored that in. We factored in new business that we've already sold but has to be installed. We've factored in business that is migrating away from us as you'd expect. And then we've factored in some mix of flows, some good continued positive flows, for example, in EMEA, strength in the ETF activity. Little bit of headwind in hedge fund. So I'd characterize it as an outlook that factors in all the various parts that you'd expect. James Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe you did have very nice improvement on the standardized ratios and leverage ratios sequentially on year-over-year. Does that -- I think last CCAR, you guys were flat with your buyback. Does that give you some wiggle room, particularly with the tax cut to up the buyback this year? Is that a fair way to think about it? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it's a little early to say. What I'd tell you is that we're quite conscious about our capital position under CCAR. I think we made a decision early in the year that, that would be just like revenue growth and operating leverage in Beacon. Managing a compact balance sheet would be a priority for this year. We've done that, I think, with pretty good results. So it certainly positions us well, and I'd say we did that purposely. I think a little soon to jump to what you're going to ask for in CCAR. We actually have to -- we're waiting. Maybe even this week, if not next week, we'll see the CCAR instructions and see if they are very similar to past years or if there's anything new. So a lot of moving parts. And obviously, as we know more, we'll let you know more. Operator : Another question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : This is the first conference call since the CEO change has been announced and I was just hoping to get some kind of discussion on that. And I guess, Jay, you have 343 more days to go before you step down as CEO, but who's counting? I guess the question is -- Ron O'Hanley, I'm not sure if Ron's there on the line, but certainly Ron, you've run 3 of the largest asset managers globally. Certainly, the GE acquisition has gone better than you guys expected. You have record AUM. So no issues with that, but some questions that would come up. The first one is for you, Jay, you'll be leaving before Beacon is done and granted you've accelerated the targets, but you still have $75 million left in 2019, and your pretax margin target of 33% is not targeted, I guess, until the end of 2020. So you're leaving before you've actually gotten everything done. And then for Ron, I mean, it's 3 years at State Street for a 225-year-old company, that's not as long a tenure as you've seen in the past at State Street. And the third thing for Ron also, you've overseen asset management, but you haven't overseen the rest of the company. So what was the discussion of the board? And your thoughts, Jay, and Ron, your thoughts on accepting the job. Joseph Hooley : Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. And you're right, this is the first call since we announced our transition. And just to be clear, the transition, which I instigated is that I will leave at the -- before the end of 2018 and likely chair the board through '19. When we began that discussion a year ago with the board, they went through a pretty extensive evaluation looking at internal talent, looking at external talent. As you pointed out, Ron has been with us for 3 years. He's done a terrific job with SSgA, but he casted even broader shadow over the bigger State Street. And so the board in their evaluation concluded that Ron is the right person to take over the CEO-ship of State Street at the end of 2018. We decided, Mike, to announce it early. It's kind of unusual that we would announce early because we wanted to get Ron situated in the core businesses of both the asset servicing, trading and the Global Exchange business. And in this transition period, I'll oversee the asset management business just so he can come fully up to speed, but as you pointed out, running 3 of the largest asset managers over the last 20 years and having been the first McKinsey consultant that started their asset management business, he's deeply knowledgeable in the trends of asset management and has overseen a great deal of front office, middle office, back office transformation. So he certainly understands the business from our client perspective and understands the core components. I think this transition is designed to give him even more time to focus on, as you point out, the key for back office, middle office business. So we are working together throughout 2018, with a plan to turn over the baton in beginning of '19. To your comment, Mike, about Beacon, I think Beacon will never end, in my opinion. I mean, we've declared a premature completion of Beacon mid-'19, but Beacon represents the digitization of State Street. And I would say, Beacon, as we know it, in my view is simply a down payment. We have a long way to go to fully digitize the $33 trillion in assets that we oversee for our clients. And the ability to mine that information, and this is not something that just State Street is looking at. Everybody's looking to take that critical information, incorporate it with other data sets in order to provide insights that our clients can benefit from. So that journey is underway, but it's far from complete. And I'm not sure I'd be -- I'd live long enough to see the end of Beacon, as I know it. So I think we're on the right track. I think Ron, and more importantly, the board thought that Ron was the right guy to carry the ball for the next period. And I'm excited to work together with him to make sure the hand off is smooth and that Ron takes over the execution of Beacon and driving growth in the core business. Michael Mayo : And a follow-up then. I mean, if you leave with a pretax margin of 31%, I can't imagine that's what you want to leave at the end of 2018, so can you give any guidance for that other than 33% by year-end 2000 (sic) [ 2020 ]? Or that's where it comes out and you'll leave on that note? Joseph Hooley : I think, Mike, where -- I would say that it'll end up where it ends up based on the guidance that we gave you and based on factors that are outside of our control, market factors. I would also say that margin is important to keep focus on, but to me, it's as important that we continue to invest in this business. And so I would think it would be bad advice to just push margin at the expense of not investing in the business. I think State Street has been around for 225 years because we've kept some amount of balance between understanding clients' needs, investing in those things that represent future growth opportunities. So we're focused on margin improvement, but we're also focused on creating the right balance between investing in areas that will provide long-term payback. Eric Aboaf : Mike, it's Eric. I'll just add if you go through the outlook, you'll build up the model with the revenue growth we've given and the operating leverage guidance, right, that adds to the margin in '18. Does it get -- and in a nice way, does it pull forward the 2000 -- the 2020? 33% by a full 1 year, 2 years, I think we'll see as we get to the end of this year, but there's -- I think there's a nice -- there's another more than a down payment, a recurring payment that we're going to make on margin improvement this year in '18. Operator : Another question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Michael Carrier : Just a question on the management fees. The year-over-year, the growth was impressive. Just sequentially, it was flattish given the markets. And I didn't know if there was anything that was unusual in quarter-over-quarter numbers because it seemed a little odd. Eric Aboaf : It's Eric. Let me just start and I think -- and Jay may participate on this one as well. There's -- just to remind you, there's always a little bit of lumpiness in management fees, whether it's performance-based fees, whether it's accruals and so on and so forth. And between 2 quarters, sometimes you have a little bit of positive in one and a little bit of negative in the other. So I wouldn't read too much into the quarterly performance. If you look at the fee rate on management fees, which I think is a good indicator, it was, I think, 6.1 basis points, that's nicely in line with the first half of this year. I think third quarter was a little bit of -- was a little lumpy and nicely above where we were last year. So we're feeling -- I think we've got good results in management fees in asset management on the revenue line. Joseph Hooley : Yes, Mike, let me just unpack a little bit the quarter, which I think was quite a strong quarter, the -- we noted net flows of $6 billion in the quarter in assets under management. But importantly, we had ETF flows of $29 billion, which is -- I don't know if we've had that ever, but it's been a long time. The institutional business had $2 billion in negative flows and then cash was $21 billion in negative flows. And importantly, the cash, 2/3 of that cash outflow was -- came from our securities lending collateral. And it's clients increasingly using noncash collateral, which we don't view as a negative thing, it's really neutral to us. So I think that your question was about sequential quarter. I would say the quarter itself from a standpoint of flows was quite strong. Michael Carrier : Okay. That makes sense. Then as a follow-up, in terms of the outlook on some of the investments that you guys are making, I think throughout the industry there is a lot of commentary on fee pressure, whether it's on the asset management or servicing business. But I guess, on the flip side, when you look at some of the areas that you're investing, where do you see some of those opportunities for the best growth and maybe not pricing power, but pricing stabilization, where you can still grow the business? There's demand for the products given that there are some areas in the industry that everyone is seeing some pressure. Joseph Hooley : Let me start that one, Mike. I've mentioned a few of them earlier. But the ETF industry is obviously growing and is likely to continue to grow. And so the investment we're making in our platforms to provide -- enhance really their data and analytics services, to authorize participants and plan sponsors, I think, is a differentiator. I referenced the offshore markets, which are markets that were quite prominent and are making investments in the areas that are differentiating, transfer agent being a specific. Japanese fund market, which has historically internalized servicing, we're starting to punch through the outsourcing there. And then the last one I would kind of spike out for you is the whole data and analytics world. So we have -- Beacon and digitization represents us getting the information we hold on behalf of clients in a more real-time basis. We established GX, Global Exchange, probably 3 years ago now. And one of the products, one of the seminal products was something called DataGX, which is an aggregation platform, which we can't keep up with the demand. It represents the capability to aggregate data across not only State Street but other custodians. And so I point that out because that's -- if we secure that position, which we're in a position to do, the ability to get into the front office with data and analytics services, which not only provides some revenue uplift, but importantly, protects the core franchise that provides differentiation. So those are the 3 or 4 things that I would just highlight are things that we are investing in, which we think have revenue attendant to them. But also importantly, differentiate the core product. Operator : We have another question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just to clarify a couple of things in the guidance for the expense guidance given the fee operating leverage. I assume that includes the charges for Beacon. And Eric, if you just want to outline what you think those might be? And then, also I think a prior question asked about market return assumptions within the guidance. And I didn't get exactly what that was, if you could reiterate that. Eric Aboaf : Sure. On the expense side on Beacon, the fee operating leverage guidance is, I think, pretty straight down the middle of the fairway, right? We know what we expect on revenues and we -- and is -- and against that, our expectations of quarterly expenses. I think you saw that this quarter, we had a good-sized restructuring charge that's partly because we tend to look forward, right? The accounting guidance that encourages us to do that. And also we were laying out our plans for 2018. And so we thought through what are the -- what is the range of areas in which we're restructuring. And we followed the guidance to take that on. The guidance here on operating leverage is actually future restructuring. And I think what we tell you is we don't want to restructure every quarter, that's a little clunky. We do want to be mindful though as new opportunities come up, what are they and take action on those. And I think our perspective is, if there are new opportunities that come up from time to time, we'd expect additional benefits to come and add to the $550 million of Beacon benefits accordingly. So anyway, hopefully, that clarifies the -- on the expense side. On the fee side, we're expecting market growth, I think, in line with consensus. There's a -- I think there is a general point of view that markets will continue to tick up this year. There's a range of economists out there. We've looked at that range and said let's think about the midpoint of that range. And there's -- I'd just say, there's some optimism in that, general optimism, and we're -- we've included that in the outlook. Brian Bedell : I'm sorry, on the expenses, the -- you're $385 million through the Beacon charges now, what do you expect the terminal Beacon charge to be in? And again is that actually in the 2018 expense guide? Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think the way to think about this is, as Jay described, I mean Beacon is becoming, right, has become kind of a way of life and the way we do business. And so we can try to keep announcing a program or adding to the program or a new program. But what we'd like to move to is -- certainly, as we communicate with you all in the analysts and the investor community is that we want to do Beacon every year, right? And we -- you've seen the rate of savings, $175 million 2 years ago, $150 million last year, we expect $150 million this year. It's about 2 percentage points of improvement each year, right, on our expense base. And obviously, that accumulates through, which is really valuable from an earnings and a shareholder perspective. I think as we go forward, right, there will occasionally be some restructuring charges. If I knew enough now and I had defined actions under the accounting rules, I would be taking charges now. I will say we've tried to look forward and we've tried to look forward over the next few quarters and just it's hard for me to say that we will not come up with new initiative and new benefit. So if we have -- if we see areas of benefit that can take us past the $550 million of benefits, at that point, we'll do the right thing. And if necessary, not all initiatives take restructuring, but if necessary, we'll consider some out more. We just don't want to do that every quarter, and we'll certainly call it out if we haven't. Brian Bedell : Okay. Fair enough. And then on the fee revenue growth at 4% to 5%, just can you parse it out just between the recurring businesses, the asset servicing and asset management versus the volume and volatility-related businesses, whether you think you see better growth in the core asset servicing and asset management versus the volatility. Because I think you mentioned you'd expect volatility to remain sort of tame. And then maybe just to tack on, Jay, what you said about -- you gave a good example on DataGX as an example of digitization helping the revenue growth profile, is that -- is the incremental revenue growth opportunities from the things that you've done with Beacon also a significant part of the 4% to 5% fee growth for '18? Eric Aboaf : I think -- let me just start on the fee outlook. I think you're looking for enormous amount of detail. And in truth, right, we don't really know what the future will hold. So we're trying to give you an overall fee guidance, which is why we gave a range. I think within that, there's servicing fees, you've seen the pattern over the last year or years plowed on. I think you can use that as some trending. On asset management, that's done well and with markets -- with positive markets, it does positively well too. Just as you'll think about last year versus next year, you've got the GE acquisition that helped by half a year, so you should factor that in. And in trading, it's just could be what it could be. And I think we'd always want to be careful there. But we're not going to give guidance kind of line by line and -- because I think it's -- at that point, it's little too precise and inaccurate and we're just trying to give you some directional indications. Hopefully that's enough. Operator : Another question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : So I guess, just to clarify on the restructuring charges, it sounds, if I'm hearing what you said the right way, like there's a bit of a change in mindset. I mean, historically, they have been almost every quarter. It sounds like going forward, they're going to be more occasional when there's something really specific that you want to work on. Am I hearing that right? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think that's a good way to summarize. Geoffrey Elliott : And then just on BlackRock and that business exiting. Can you give a quick update on kind of how that flows out over the course of 2018? And is there any lumpiness that we are going to see in the numbers as a result of that? Joseph Hooley : Yes, Geoffrey, this is Jay. I'll make a comment on that. As I think we said in prior quarters, we would expect the transition to commence some time mid-first half of the year and these things can take a year or longer to progress. That's probably the best I can give you. But importantly, it's all factored into, as Eric mentioned, our fee revenue guidance. So it takes time for these things to happen. Operator : Another question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Steven Duong : This is Steven Duong in for Gerard. First question, just on your dividend, your payout ratio is around 25%. Is there a level you guys expect to bring it to in the long run, especially given your valuations? Eric Aboaf : Steven, it's Eric. There's not a level at this point that we feel wedded to either on a percentage basis or a dollar basis. I think we're continuing to do the financial and economic work on one hand to think through as you have a higher and higher PE, you adjust the mix of buyback and dividend. But there is -- on one hand, that's we do, and I think all the other banks are probably going to consider doing that given market trading levels. On the other hand, what we have also been doing is being in touch with some of our largest shareholders and certainly value your opinion about do they prefer a certain mix of dividends versus buybacks because we're certainly open to input. I think what's important to us, if I step back is that as earnings grow and EPS grows that we share that with shareholders as much as we can and that's why you see us taking the dividend up. Certainly, we're going to consider shareholders actively as we go into CCAR this year, for example. Steven Duong : Great. And then just in your presentation, you'd mentioned that you guys had reduced manual touches on trades by 30% since 2015. Do you -- is there a dollar amount you're aware of that that's brought to the bottom line? And is there a further target of reducing the manual touches too? Joseph Hooley : Steve, let me -- this is Jay. Let me comment on that. The -- we put that out there as just more symbolic to what we're trying to achieve here, which is we get a lot of input, client trade data. And our goal is that, that enters electronically and passes through our system electronically. And what we referenced there is eliminating manual transactions, transactions that have to be manually fixed in order to see them [indiscernible] internally. So we have internal metrics, none of which would be particularly helpful for you, but we do measure all the stuff. And the more important thing is this whole straight-through processing, which is to connect our systems internally, which is, in some respects, what Beacon is all about, so that as information enters us electronically, it passes all the way through and out the other side. And it has all the obvious benefits of better service, lower cost and it enables this -- it frees up this information so that the data can be used for other purposes. Eric Aboaf : And I would just add. There's a host of metrics, 1 and 2 levels down below that and across our accounting platform and systems across our product line and businesses around unit costs as you'd expect. Straight-through processing is important, but can actually be measured at many, many individual points in the chain. And our perspective is, we continue to build out Beacon on one hand, but now with our -- as you've seen, we've refined our organization structure where we've added more to the operations on a global basis, right? We're creating a real operations and production organization, which is almost twice the size of what it was, right, relative to the client-facing business activity. That gives us an even larger area in which we can systematically drive that straight-through processing in those kind of unit cost improvements and efficiencies. Operator : Another question from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Jay, first question for you. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in the whole process of digitization? You've had a competitor who has talked about stepping things up. Where do you stand given that you're letting a lot of the tax reform benefits drop to the bottom line? And even sort of give us a sense of outlook where you expect to be on that? Joseph Hooley : Sure, Vivek. Happy to do that. I mean, as you know, I don't have perfect visibility into the competitive landscape, but I do feel pretty good about where we are relative to Beacon. And I'd build a little bit of a story starting with for a long time, State Street has had good discipline around common systems. We made a number of acquisitions in the last 15 years. As we acquired, we've moved to common accounting systems, cash and security systems. So we have a great starting point. Beacon, as I was mentioning earlier, represents the digitization of connecting all these systems up together and taking advantage of straight-through processing. And if your question of where are we in that journey, we're 1/3 of the way into it, just pick a number. We've got a very high percentage of those incoming trades that I referenced earlier come through on an automated basis. But in my perfect world, think about the fund accounting activity that we do for tens of thousands of portfolios all over the world. A trade would come in, it would hit the accounting books, it would hit the cash books, it would hit the pricing books and you'd have a virtual system where you could price a portfolio virtually throughout the day. So that's my -- and once you get there, you essentially have a hands-free fund accounting operation, where everything is virtual and automated, which would take all of the manual cost out. It would, as I say, allow one to calculate a net asset value throughout the day and most importantly, and the real prize here, I've said this consistently over the years, is freeing up that data. If you have that data available on a real-time basis, what you can do through DataGX and other sources is where the future is in this business. So that's -- I think, on a relative basis, that we seem to be ahead of the pack. From my standpoint, we had a better starting point. I think we got at this earlier. The other thing to your question, Vivek, I would say is we're going as fast as we can go. We don't feel constrained by investment. But when you're changing systems the way we are or operating day in and day out, there's a certain pacing, there's only so much -- as you can only go so fast without creating damage. So we're investing at the optimum or maximum pace that we can given the change that we are invoking. Vivek Juneja : Great. Eric, a question for you on the tax front. I hear you're getting some of the benefits from the tax reforms, but just trying to triangulate all the operating and GAAP and future one metric. As I step back and think about it, are you changing the amount of tax-advantaged investments? Are you reducing it? Are you increasing it? Trying to get a sense of what's going on underneath? And -- because you are going down 4% to 5%, but yet, the GAAP rate isn't going up quite as much. So if you can just help with that. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Vivek. Let me try to describe how you get to the GAAP, right? I think tax-advantaged investments, for us, will be roughly comparable in '18 versus '17. And if you put that in with the new stated rates on federal, state and then foreign together, that's what gives us the about 16% rate that we expect in '18 and the roughly $150 million of benefit. I think there's complexity in tax rates. We -- the headline rates, as I said, go down by about that 5 points. Because the tax-advantaged investments tend to be dollar-based credits, those don't flow to the effective tax rate in the same way as net income continues to grow and munis have a version of that, but they are also affected by the tax rate. So there's a couple of different moving parts. I think as we step back, we are pleased with landing at what we expect to be a 16% tax rate in '18. We think that's going to be -- that's better than many other banks. And I think that's driven by the tax planning we've done over the years. And that rate, and we've given a bit of a range, right, 15% to 17%, I'm just using the midpoint, we'll see where that goes going forward. I think specifically as regards to tax-advantaged investments, we have -- we intend to continue, right, that activity. Clearly, we're going to -- clearly, there are benefits of that activity under the old rates, but there's certainly still benefits under the new rate. On a Basel III returns basis, it's still attractive. I think there is going to be a question of do you get the same amount of tax-advantaged deals out there that are available in the marketplace, do you get more wind, less solar, vice versa, LIHTC. We think there's going to be some amount of market adjustments. And I think if that ends up -- those market adjustments end up changing the amount that we'll do, we'll certainly signal that. But for the time being, in at least dollar terms, it will be roughly consistent last year versus expectations for '18. Operator : Another question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just had one clarification question on your outlook on Slide 19. The way we're looking at it, when you give the 7% to 8% for your revenue growth, a 10% to 13% NII growth, is the base that you're using just simply those for your numbers on Slide 18? Eric Aboaf : It's Eric. For the left column, right, on Page 19, which is the historical operating basis outlook, it's the like-for-like outlook, then you would use the figures from Slide 18 because that's the historical basis that we just reported in '17. When you move to the right side of 19, which is a GAAP-based outlook, you actually have to go back into our financial supplement. And we could -- the IR team could certainly help you do that and use those amount as the basis, so that you have an apple-to-apples portrayal. I think on an EPS basis, the net income basis, you're close, but the line items are sometimes a bit different. And we can -- I think those are well described in the supplement because we show both operating and GAAP, and we can certainly help you walk through -- help walk you through it if you have any questions. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then on the tax reform, I know you've outlined 3 different ways that you're investing the savings from the tax reform, but is there a way to think about that as kind of a year 1 investment? Are you expecting some acceleration in year 2, especially in light of what some of the competitors may be doing with greater investment than what you're doing in year 1? Joseph Hooley : I think you have to probably unpack the 3 different line items. The -- adding to the matches and defined contribution would be a recurring kind of a cost of the investing and training. Some of that's technology, so that's front ended. It trails off a little bit. And then the third, which is just to increase the match, we would make that determination each year into the future. So it's a little bit of a mix, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : But are you expecting more wage inflation, I guess, in the second year above and beyond what you'd normally expect for merit increase? Eric Aboaf : No. I think from an outlook standpoint, I think we've got wage inflation from a merit standpoint in '16 to '17, we had it in '14 to '15 to '16, we have some into '18. And I think there's a tradition of some amount of merit increase, and we are supportive of that tradition. I don't think we see an acceleration or deceleration at this point. Operator : We have a last question from the line of Steven Wharton of JPMorgan. Steven Wharton : Actually, Vivek asked my question, but I'm just want to ask one little additional add-on for that. If you did decide in the future to reduce the amount of tax-advantaged investments because basically, the tax rate is now lower, so arguably the value of those is less. Would you then see an offset on the revenue side? Because the way I have been thinking about it is that -- I mean, you guys have been a very aggressive user of tax-advantaged securities, which is why you have such a low tax rate, and I just wonder if the appetite in '19 and '20 is there for those type of securities? Or would you rather let the tax rate drift up and instead invest in securities at a higher yield? And would that be a net neutral? Eric Aboaf : It's Eric, Steven. Let me answer this in 2 ways. I think if you do less tax-advantaged investments, then you're right, you have less revenue amortization, less of a contra revenue and then less tax benefits. So you've the right way around there. I think if you step back, there's, I think, a number of different tax-advantaged investment areas. There's munis, there's LIHTC, there's wind and solar as the major categories. In each of those, we think may or may not adjust to some extent and each of those we run through a kind of return screening process. Now munis, some would say won't adjust very much because it's primarily a consumer-based market. We'll need to see if that's the case or does it adjust. LIHTC, there's a long tradition. And I think wind and solar, many would say there would be some realignment because of expectations from investors of what they need to earn. So I think it's early to tell. I think we'd say though that the returns have always been quite attractive in tax-advantaged investments. And if you adjust the rates by the amount we have, there's still healthy returns. And so we don't feel a need to quickly change our tactics and strategy, and our perspective is that they are still valuable to do at these tax rates and in this form. But obviously, as the market evolves, we'll always be -- we're always reassessing and we'll do accordingly. Steven Wharton : So is it safe to say that if you continued to invest at the same level, then there would be no upward creep, all else being equal in the 15% to 17% in the tax rate? Eric Aboaf : No, you actually have to be careful there, right? If you invest at the same dollar amount each year as you have higher net income, your effective tax rate starts to creep up. Alternatively, if you invest the same amount of growth in tax-advantaged income, if that growth in dollar terms and percentage terms is similar to the growth in EBIT, then the effective tax rate stays relatively constant. And I think that's a bridge for us to cross in '19 and '20 as we learn about how the market evolves and it goes back to Betsy's question about where we think tax rates will go. And I think as we learn more this year, there will be a lot -- there are a number of interpretations we need to see from the Treasury Department, right, with regard to this tax law change. We need to see if there are market adjustments and all these on some of these tax-advantaged investments. And once we do that, I think late this year, we should have a better bead on '19 and we'll share that with you and all the others. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Please continue presenters. Joseph Hooley : Thanks, Nora, and thanks, everybody, for spending time with us this morning. We look forward to talking to you after the first quarter. Thanks. Operator : Thank you all for participating. You may now all disconnect.",

On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2018 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include adjusted basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our 1Q 2018 slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may vary materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now let me turn it over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Ilene and good morning, everyone. As you've seen in our announcement today, we started the year with strong business momentum across our asset servicing and asset management business, as we continued to deepen client relationships, win new business and advance our digital leadership. First quarter results included strong EPS growth and improved return on equity. Importantly, we continue to see momentum across our core franchise. Strength in equity markets and new business lifted our asset under custody administration with growth of approximately 11% from first quarter 2017 to more than $33 trillion. We announced record new servicing commitments of $1.3 trillion in the first quarter with total new business yet to be installed of $1.6 trillion. We're seeing strength across our pipeline, both geographically and by capability. State Street Global Advisors finished first quarter 2018 with asset under management levels of $2.7 trillion, up approximately 7% from first quarter 2017, driven by strength in equity markets and ETF flows with continued traction in our low cost ETF products launched last year. Furthermore, we continue to realize benefits from State Street Beacon, our multi-year program to digitize our business and drive new solutions and innovations for our clients as evidenced by this quarter's announced wins. Beacon investments are enabling us to go beyond traditional custody services and provide greater speed, scale and quality declines globally. Additionally, our ability to deliver new tools and functionality is proving to be a meaningful factor, and from a differentiation in clients decision to expand their relationship with us across asset classes and funds. But to conclude, I'm very pleased with our financial performance to-date. Revenue growth was strong driven by both fee revenue and net interest income, reflecting higher U.S. market interest rate, continued market appreciation, new client business wins and higher trading activity. We really focused on expense management, while calibrating investment in our business with the revenue environment and prudently investing in new products and solutions. We also purchased $350 million of our common stock and declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.42 per share in first quarter 2018. And importantly, we continue to be well positioned to achieve our financial objectives in 2018, including delivering full year positive fee operating leverage. Now over to Eric. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Jay and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where I would like to remind you of a few items. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting primarily on a GAAP basis. We will continue to call out notable items such as restructuring cost to better provide investors insights on an underlying business trends. As you can see in the right side of Slide 4, we did not have any notable items in 1Q, 2018. We have, though, listed the notable items for 4Q, 2017 and 1Q, 2017. As a reminder, 1Q, 2018 results reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standards, resulting in an increase in both fee revenue and total expense by $65 million, which is EBIT neutral. Now let me move to Slide 5. Most of my comments will focus on 1Q 2018 results compared to 1Q 2017, the year ago period. 1Q 2018 EPS increased to $1.62, up 41%, reflecting strength in servicing and management fees from higher equity markets and new business, continued momentum in net interest income supported by the higher interest rate environment and the lower share count. We continue to prudently manage expenses relative to the revenue environment, as demonstrated by an increase of 3.4 percentage points in 1Q 2018 pretax margin. We thus achieved positive operating leverage of 5 full percentage points. Fee operating leverage was negative six-tenth of a point. The elevated impact of higher FX swap cost, which we would have preferred to book in net interest income, amounted to a 1% headwind to fee operating leverage this quarter. Notably, return on equity increased approximately 3 percentage points relative to 1Q 2017. 1Q 2018 results reflected a 14% tax rate, albeit lower than our full year expectation, primarily due to a seasonal benefit of approximately $0.02 a share attributed to equity compensation. Now let me turn to Slide 6 to briefly review AUCA and AUM performance. AUCA and AUM increased from 1Q 2017, benefiting both our asset servicing and asset management businesses. 1Q 2018 AUCA of $33.3 trillion increased 12%. Growth was primarily driven by a combination of market appreciation, client activity and new business. Strong inflows continued in ETFs around the world in both on and offshore funds in EMEA and within our middle-office outsourcing business. Hedge fund outflows continued in 1Q 2018, albeit at more modest levels. Notably, as Jay referenced, we announced a record $1.3 trillion in new mandates for 1Q 2018. In our asset management business, AUM increased 7% driven by market appreciation and higher-yielding ETF inflows, partially offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index mandates. Our new low-cost ETF offering continues to gain momentum and added $7 billion inflows this quarter, bringing us to $12 billion cumulatively over just 6 months. Please turn to Slide 7, where I will review 1Q 2018 revenue compared to 1Q 2017. You will also find additional detail in the appendix with the sequential quarter comparison. Total fee revenue increased approximately 8%, reflecting strong performance across our businesses. Let me take you through some of the details. Servicing fees increased 10%, reflecting higher global equity markets and new business, partially offset by some continued modest hedge find outflows. Adjusting for currency translation, which you can see at the table at the bottom, servicing fees were up 6%, which shows strong business momentum. Management fees increased 24%, benefiting from higher global equity markets, as well as approximately $45 million related to the new revenue recognition standard. Trading revenue increased 11%, primarily due to strong FX client volumes and higher electronic trading activity as well as approximately $50 million in related to the new revenue recognition standard. The breadth and depth of our FX capabilities and platforms continues to differentiate our offerings. Securities finance fees increased from 1Q 2017, driven by higher lending activity in the agency business. Processing fees and other revenue decreased from 1Q 2017, largely reflecting the absence of a one-time gain in 1Q 2017 from the sale of the business and the impact of elevated FX swap costs, which I mentioned earlier. We would expect lower FX swap cost going forward here, as more swaps qualify for hedge accounting and as we ship the currency mix of our balance sheet. Moving to Slide 8. NII was up 23% and NIM increased 26 basis points on a fully tax equivalent basis from 1Q 2017. NII and NIM benefited from higher U.S. interest rates, disciplined liability pricing, higher client balances. U.S. dollar, interest-bearing, client deposit betas floated up during 1Q 2018, in line with our expectations. Relative to 4Q 2017, average non-interest bearing deposits declined only slightly, while interest bearing deposits increased $5 billion on average, which demonstrated good client engagement. Relative to 4Q 2017, NIM improved 5 basis points driven by higher market rate and disciplined deposit pricing, partially offset by a smaller tax equivalent adjustment for our municipal bond portfolio and a modestly larger balance sheet. As we said previously, we are comfortable \u2013 we are comfortable with modestly growing the balance sheet to accommodate client demand, and have even created more room to do so by adjusting our investment portfolio this quarter, which I will cover in a few minutes. Now I will turn to Slide 9 to review 1Q 2018 expenses. Expenses were up 6% adjusted for currency translation, though this included $65 million in higher expenses related to the new accounting standards for revenue recognition, partially offset by the absence of restructuring cost this quarter. When considering these two effects, underlying expenses increased only 4% for the year ago quarter. The components of the 4% underlying growth in expenses include, 3 percentage points of new business and volumes, 2 percentage points of merit and incentive compensation and 2 percentage points in technology spent, partially offset by a net 3 percentage points in Beacon savings. From a GAAP line item perspective, compensation and employee benefits increased primarily due to increased costs to support new business as well as annual merit and incentive compensation, partially offset by Beacon savings. Transaction processing increased relative to 1Q 2017 driven by higher sub-custody fees. Information systems cost increased relative to 1Q 2017 as a result of additional technologies spent. Occupancy costs were up compared to 1Q 2017, but have been relatively flat for several quarters. Finally, as compared to 4Q 2017, expenses were up primarily due to the seasonal deferred incentive compensation cost, which are described in the footnotes. Let me now move to Slide 10 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. On the left side of the slide, you see some of the achievements which are enabling us to win with clients. We continue to digitize how we receive and process data from clients, using speed and scale as a way to differentiate service. Key accomplishments include improving efficiencies from enhancing our global accounting platform and upgrading the functionality of our information delivery platform to better meet client needs. We're also continuing to realize enterprise-wide efficiencies as we automate internal processes through Beacon initiatives. On the right side of the page, you can see that we achieved $58 million in net Beacon saves this quarter, through optimizing our core servicing business, transforming our IT infrastructure and by gaining efficiencies within the corporate functions and SSGA. We continue to expect $150 million in Beacon savings in 2018, including the $58 million achieved this quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 11 to review our quarter end balance sheet and capital position. On the left of the slide, you will notice that we reduced the size of our investment portfolio from year-end 2017. We sold approximately $12 billion of non-HQLA securities during the quarter. Those portfolio sales reflect our strategy to prioritize capital efficient client lending, while prudently managing OCI sensitivity. We chose to rotate out of thin spread credit securities and we will reinvest into interest earning assets over time. Trimming the portfolio, especially the dollar portions, will also have the benefit of reducing the size of our FX swap balances and the associated cost which I mentioned earlier. Moving to the right of the slide, our capital ratios remain healthy and all of our ratios are flat to up, year-on-year. As compared to 4Q 2017, the only significant change was a decrease of 80 basis points in the standardized version of a common equity tier 1 ratio due to an increase in client overdraft balances, which has since been recovered by our clients and the impact has reversed. While we are mindful of our leverage ratios, recent regulatory developments make us even more confident, we can put our balance sheet to work for our clients. To recap, moving to Slide 12, we saw strong business momentum, resulting in headline total revenue growth of 13% and servicing fee revenue growth of 10%. Our pretax margin increased by 3.4 percentage points from 1Q 2017, and we delivered EPS growth of 41%. Before turning the call back to Jay, let me take a moment to provide you with some additional color relative to our quarterly outlook. We expect business momentum within asset servicing to continue. Although, there may be some variability within quarters as new business is installed. We expect securities finance, which includes the agency and enhanced custody businesses, to experience some 2Q seasonal uptick in relation to 1Q, albeit at muted levels relative to last year. As I mentioned earlier, we expect swap cost to moderate as we adjust the currency mix of our balance sheet. As such, a typical quarterly range for processing fees and other revenue should be around $35 million to $45 million in 2018. We expect momentum in NII to continue in 2Q, consistent with our full year target range. In summary, we believe that our strong first quarter business momentum positions us well to execute against both our financial and strategic priorities, including positive fee operating leverage, in keeping with our full year 2018 outlook range that we provided in January. Now let me turn the call back to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Eric. And then Sam, we should now \u2013 I'd ask you to open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Eric, interested to hear a little bit more about the plan to shift up the investment and the earning asset portfolio. What types of loans are you looking to grow? And how should we think about that as far as a change, proportionally? I think it might be helpful to sort of base a little bit of that. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Hey, Brennan. It's Eric. Let me describe a little bit of our intentions here. Clearly, as we enter this market with rising rates, it's a natural time for us to consider how much to keep on non-HQLA assets versus other interests earning assets. We've made a choice to continue to optimize that part of the balance sheet. And what you'll see us doing over time is shifting some of that into interest earning assets for clients, right? And I'll \u2013 some of that will be lending, as you've asked about come back that in a moment. Some that'll be support the enhanced custody business, some that'll support our other activities. And then another portion, just we reinvested in interest earning assets that HQLA qualifying, and thereby, balance out the balance sheet. So I think you'll see us continue to design the balance sheet in a way that supports multiple objectives. In terms of lending, our lending growth, and you see mid-teen lending growth over the last year. It's been consistent over the last couple of years. We lend to 40 Act funds, we lend to the parent companies of some of our large clients, we do capital call financing for some of our private equity client. And so, that's the kind of, I'll call it, near end lending that will be \u2013 that'll continue to be the core of what we do. And our perspective is that some of that lending is remunerative on its own. Some of that lending is actually positive, because it gives us an extra way to interact and to connect with our clients. And that's something that they value. And sometimes actually ask for as part of the servicing mandates for others that we participate in. Brennan Hawken : Yes, thanks. That makes a lot of sense actually. And it seems like a good way to expand out the relationship. So another question on the balance sheet. And it seemed like you implied it in your prepared remarks, Eric, but please correct me if I'm wrong. It seems like the balance sheet and the average deposit balances grew here similar to the peers. But seems as though there is sustained appetite there. And so am I correct in implying that we shouldn't necessarily think about that reverting from what was a pretty strong growth rate here this quarter? And you think that, that could sustain, or at least the indication so far looks like it's pretty durable here? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, yes, I think the way to think about our balance sheet growth is that you dial back three years, we needed to compress the size of our balance sheet and kind of focus of the most valuable part of the funding of the deposits that we had. And we did that like many other. I think last year, we felt like we had also seen another tick up in balances and some currencies and some overall balances. And we felt like we had to continue to trim and make it more compact and kind of more higher NIM generating. I think we've gotten to a point over the last couple of quarters where we're comfortable with the size of our balance sheet and we signaled, as part of January outlook, that we're comfortable with modest growth. And so you saw a little bit of that, quarter-on-quarter. The trimming of the investment portfolio gives us an ability to do that. Deposits now, in dollars in particular, come in at healthy margins. And it's just another way to engage with all of our clients, whether it's the asset managers, whether it's the alternative providers, whether it's some of the FX kind of parties. They all value the ability to leave their cash with such a highly-rated counterparty. And our perspective is, that's part of what we can do and should do. And if you come full circle, that's a good service for them and provides good earnings and earnings growth for us. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. If you could talk about the new business wins. Talk about what they're engaging you on? Is it new versus existing clients, fee-rate relative to overall maybe you could go through a little bit of that? Jay Hooley : Sure, Glenn. This is Jay. I'll start and then Eric can jump in. Obviously, an outsized quarter, this quarter for new business commitments, that the $1.3 trillion. And not surprisingly, there's a couple of big deals embedded within that. I would say, general themes, our clients consolidating with fewer providers. So if the two big deals, one represented that, a global player that operates in many different geographies and chose to consolidate with State Street, which is terrific. The other big deal represented a large client that decided for the first time to outsource fund accounting to the administration. Which I think just speaks to the ongoing challenge that the asset management industry is having and looking for ways to get more efficient, outsource more activities. So that represent a little bit of the outlier growth in the quarter. I would say, maybe more generally, Glenn, the pipelines and the new business that we committed is pretty diverse. Little concentration in Europe, which continues to be an outperformer in the offshore marketplace. ETS, as a service provider to ETS, we think we have a very differentiated proposition. So ETS continue to be a theme. But across the geographies, well balanced. Final point I'd make before I give Eric a shot is that in the two big deals that we \u2013 that were embedded in the quarter. They both went very deep in their diligence looking at, as you'd expect, State Street's capabilities. And Beacon featured very positively. As people get in and peel back the covers and understand the investments that we're making and how we view a future around consolidating back, middle, front office, it's really a differentiator. So in one of those in particular, I don't remember being examined the way we were examined by that perspective client. And the deeper they got, the better we looked. So I'd say that it's reinforcing, to me, the efforts of Beacon, not just to create more efficiencies, but when clients take a look at us, they've been \u2013 really understand that we are investing for the future. And we do have a vision about how this business is going to look over time. Eric, would you add anything? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Glenn, I'd just add that, it showed some real positive momentum in the business. I'd just be careful. It's hard to model how and when that this. Some new business comes in right away. Some of the simpler activity. Some of the more complex stuff takes time. We're not going to, in any particular quarter, give guidance as to when stuff is going to get installed or not. I think we're just going to overdo it then. But there is a range, right? Sometimes you bring on an alternative mandate and you get 5 or 6 bps because of the fee structure. Sometimes it comes on as custody accounting administration, so you get what might be typical in terms of fee yield. And sometimes, you might just get custody because there may be other activities in discussion or possible down the road. And so you start with your foot in the door, so to speak. And that comes at a fraction of the typical or the average fee rate. So there is a mix there. I think it's a nice positive momentum from a business standpoint, which makes us feel a little good about the progress and successes today. Glenn Schorr : Okay. One tiny follow-up, Eric, on the balance sheet. It seems like it got more fixed rate versus floating. As rates are rising, just not as intuitive as I would've thought. I'm sure it's much more involved than that. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Glenn. Good observation, what the \u2013 the immediate change that you noticed, which is really just a quarter-on-quarter change on the asset side of the balance sheet. So we'll come back on the liabilities on the asset side as we sell down the Non-HQLA securities. You know the bulk of those were credit instruments. Credit instruments tend to be floating rate. So the mix changes just in kind of a percentage nature, not in a dollar amount. We've continued to maintain, though, the asset-sensitive balance sheet that we've had. And we feel good about that. That's paid out nicely over the last two years and \u2013 so our asset sensitivity still remains in the range where we'll \u2013 where we're positioned for a rising rates, in particular, in this short end of the curve. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. And Ken your line is open. Your next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi guys, good morning. I want to start off with just talking about the operating leverage dynamic in the quarter. So I understand the FX swap dynamic. Obviously, Eric, you point tracked it about a 1 percentage point from operating leverage on the fee side. So adjusted modestly positive, but again albeit, very modest especially in the light of pretty strong equity markets and improving volumes. So maybe go through a little what's going on there? Anything that drove, in particular, sort of muted operating leverage on the fee side this quarter. I don't know, which is the sizable wins that might've suppressed some of that a little bit. So just help us understand how to think through the fee operating leverage through the rest of the year. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Alex. Fair question. There's always variability quarter-on-quarter on both the revenue side and the expense side. You saw that on the revenue side with the FX swaps. And in that processing other line that we have, it's really the kind of all other line. Every bank has that somewhere in their books. And so you have the swaps. And then we had slightly better results from that a year ago. Slightly below average this year. And so the year-on-year actually got accentuated. You have other stuff in there. Small stuff. You have the mark-to-mark on the seed capital for a new asset management fund, which was positive a year ago. You've got the tax advantage investments and how much they run through revenue. On the negative side, that was less negative a year ago. So you kind of have those puts and takes. And that's why in addition to the FX swap, we saw lower than typical processing in other line and that impacted the top line part of operating leverage by one point for FX swaps. And then there is another point but it's small stuff, which we don't like to get into, but just tends to play through. On the expense side, if you think through expenses, you keep an eye on currency translation, keep an eye on the accounting, the revenue recognition accounting standard and then the absence of restructuring, underlying expenses were up 4%. That's the [indiscernible] given the revenue momentum in the business, but came in just a little more than it may in a typical quarter. So we had some of the ramp-up cost, as you mentioned, of new business, right? And that kind of has some ebbs and flows. But as you imagine as you bring on new business, before you bring it on, you've got to run in parallel. Before you run in parallel, you got to set up. Some of that is technology cost, which is typically expense. Some of that is people, some of that is underlying processing. And so there are periods where one quarter or even two quarters, we can pick up expense in advance of the revenues. . : Alex Blostein : Okay. So no real change there. And then the second question for me, I guess, just around some of the NIR dynamics. I guess one, maybe you would \u2013 could hit on the deposit betas. Obviously, costing can be pretty well controlled in the U.S. side. For quite some times frankly as well. So Maybe talk a little bit about what were the deposit betas on the U.S. side and why they're so much lower than for your peers? And then maybe just to kind of round up the whole conversation around processing fee versus NIR. Do I hear you correctly that, I guess, if the FX cost go away, roughly $10 million-ish drag this quarter, so processing fees steps up about $10 million but then NIR goes down $10 million. Eric Aboaf : Let me take those questions in the order that you asked. So betas came in reasonably well relative to expectations. So we've been signaling that they've been floating up. We had betas in the U.S. in the low 40% range, which is kind of right where we had thought they would come. That's up from last, I guess, the last rates hike we had. We had it about 25%. So we're kind of in \u2013 we've been moving up in line with our expectations. The part of the balance sheet that performs better than expectation was actually that transition from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, was actually slower than we've continued to model. And so if you think about interest-bearing betas are at expectations or even though a bit better. But total deposit betas, right? Because that's what really matters, that's come in better than expected. And I think if I step back, I think that's in the range of what we've seen in peers. I think you see some types of deposits are \u2013 that corporate deposit money, very high beta. Or the well management money, very high beta. The retail is very low beta and we tend to be in the middle as a custody bank. And so we've been pleased with those results. And finally, just on the FX swaps, that's \u2013 you've got it right. They \u2013 instead of being in NIR, that FX swap cost, that ended up in processing fees. If they had qualified for hedge accounting, they would've been in the other line. I think going forward, we \u2013 our intention is certainly to put as much as possible into the NII line by making sure they qualify for hedge accounting. But even more importantly, our perspective is, we should bring down the volumes of FX swaps. They were up at the \u2013 the kind of $15 billion to $20 billion level. They're now in the $10 billion to $15 billion level. And actually trending at the lower end of that range. Our intention in the coming quarter is to bring down even further. And as we've trimmed the investment portfolio by trimming the dollar portion of the investment portfolio on non-HQLA side, that actually, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, can actually bring down the swaps further. So our perspective is to align the balance sheet over time, so that it's as currency matched as possible. That'll bring the swap cost down. And in fact, it'll give us, over time, the ability to take advantage of swap dislocations and actually do a little bit better depending \u2013 one way or the other. Alex Blostein : Got it, great. Thanks for taking all the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to go back \u2013 one more on the balance sheet. The end of period balance sheet, obviously, was a lot higher. As a big step \u2013 I mean a big difference from the average balance sheet. I know there's always a lot of quarter end noise. But maybe, Eric, if you can comment on whether you think that reverts and we should look at the sort of the trend line on the average balance sheet. And also on the non-interest-bearing side, that spiked up. It looks like about \u2013 by about $10 billion. So just want to make sure we're normalizing that. And then on the swap, I think that's out of the non-U.S. deposit side, the $22 million if I'm not mistaken. And would that make it more like an 18 basis point core rate instead of a 7 basis point core rate on that? Eric Aboaf : Let me start on the balance sheet. And then I'd \u2013 actually to clarify the swap question a little bit more. On the balance sheet, we do get, on a daily basis and then a end of quarter basis, we do get higher deposit balances. And if you think about the very largest of our asset management and pension clients, that is quite typical. I don't think this quarter was any different than the other quarter ends other than it ended on a Good Friday. And that, in some cases, creates a little more cash on our balance sheet. But there's nothing \u2013 there was nothing unique about the quarter end which signals any changes really on the average balance sheet. The average balance sheet, as I described, I think is moving in the right direction. I think we've got good client engagement. We've got a good sharing of the benefits of the rate rises with our clients and we continue to engage them in making sure that that's fair on both sides. And as I said earlier, our perspective is our balance sheet. If there is something we can put to work for the benefit of our clients, we're going to keep doing that. That's a nice way to supplement the fee revenue that we have in this business. Do you want to just clarify a little more on your second question? Brian Bedell : Yes, all I did was added the $22 million of the swap cost to the non-interest, I'm sorry, to the non-U.S. deposit line. And that would take that rate from 7 basis points I think you published in your average balance sheet to that 18 basis points to sort of establish a core rate. Is that accurate? Is that \u2013 am I \u2013 is the geography correct in where I'm putting now? Eric Aboaf : Let me \u2013 why don't we have the IR team follow up off-line. I think you're \u2013 there is a two parts of the answer to that question. First, the FX swap cost were $15 million this quarter and they were a $7 million benefit a year ago. So the $22 million I called out, the delta year-on-year. So you've got to adjust for the absolutes. And then we can work with you on the line item part of the balance sheet. I think directionally, it should go against the non-U.S. domicile depositors. I'll remind you, this is a domiciled view of depositors, not the currency view. Sometimes, those are similar. Sometimes, those are not. So you've got to be careful there. And we do have some extra footnotes at the bottom of that average balance sheet page of the supplement to try to help. But why don't we just do that offline with you and help with the modeling. Brian Bedell : Yes, sure. Perfect. And then the follow-up would be on backup to the wins, what the $1.3 trillion, sounds like the bulk of that is in two clients, Jay. Sometimes I know you \u2013 I don't know if you've announced the actual clients. It'd be great if you could say those. If not, the \u2013 just understanding, once again, the nature of that business. I think you mentioned one is a mutual funds accounting administration. And I forget, did you say the other was a mid-office? And effectively, from an AUC level or AUA level, it looks like it offsets the BlackRock loss and should we be thinking of this coming in, overall, as a higher yield than the BlackRock was? Eric Aboaf : Yes, let me take that, Brian. We \u2013 we're not in a position to name the names. But you have it right that there are a couple of meaty transactions which make up the bulk of that $1.3 million. And they're both kind of multidimensional. I described one as multi-geographic of full custody, admin, middle-office. Both existing clients that we had a small piece of. And then the other really represents more of a custody fund accounting fund admin. Mostly U.S. And these will feather in over the course of the next year with component parts along the way till we get it fully implemented. But I think, I would go back to my point, they do represent what I've been saying all along, which is the \u2013 we're getting more clients that are consolidating with fewer providers. And increasingly the pressure felt by the asset management industry on multiple dimensions, the active to passive, the regulatory pressure they're feeling. Both of these clients, by the way, took advantage of our new capabilities and liquidity, monthly liquidity reporting, which is a new SEC requirement. So I think it's more outsourcing. It's more consolidation. All good news. And we also had our typical range of new business as, I mentioned, across hedge, across ETF, offshore domiciles. So a really good momentum. You mentioned the BlackRock offset, I mean, they \u2013 all of this kind of offsets, generally, the BlackRock outflow, which I think we said will kind of commence somewhere mid-year and that'll take a year to roll out as well. So it all \u2013 collectively, it gives us greater confidence in our ability to meet the guidance that we provided on service fee growth rates for 2018. Brian Bedell : And is it fair to say it's a richer revenue yield than the BlackRock loss? Jay Hooley : It's a real mix, Brian. It wouldn't be sensible for me to try to break that down. Brian Bedell : Okay. Fair enough, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just following up on that. I guess, Jay, what's your sense of sort of your active discussions or pipeline right now? Do you feel like it's stronger than it has been? Just kind of get a sense of the environment. Obviously, you had a very good quarter today on a couple of big wins. So how do we think about your pipeline and thoughts on it going forward? Jay Hooley : I would say, Jim, it's been steady and quite positive. I don't \u2013 these two transactions maybe a little bit of an outlier. But we continue to see opportunities across the spectrum. And we'll continue to be positioned, whether it's the alternative world, the ETF world or traditional fund world. Folks consolidating, doing more. The more outsourcing piece, which Brian's question got into a little bit. There's more middle-office activity. There is increasing interest in having us wire together the back office and the middle-office. Through DataGX, we're offering new database analytics services. I mentioned the liquidity stress testing. So the environment is such that not only asset managers but also asset owners, big pension funds \u2013 our craving more outsourcing, more analytics, more ability to respond to regulatory requirements. So you might say at, one level, it\u2019s may extent that there is a lot of pressure in our client set. And that with normal pressures back to us. But it's also \u2013 it also comes with pretty steady opportunity to do more for them. And some of the referenced spend on technology is designed to stay ahead of the new product opportunities, which are pretty vast as well. So strong, broad environment for new business. No real change. I don't see it leading up be there. Jim Mitchell : Okay, that's really helpful. And then maybe for Eric, to be a dead horse on the balance sheet. But you guys were the only one of your peers to see deposits grow and grow pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter at period end. You're sort of signaling maybe continued growth in average assets when others are signaling declines. So is it \u2013 are you competing on price? I mean how do we think about what you're seeing and how you're attracting those deposits versus what your peers are seeing? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Jim, there is some, I think, part of \u2013 there are a couple of things going on. There is the quarter-end spikes versus the averages. There is a natural seasonality in the deposits as well that I think some of the others have referenced, January, February, tends to be higher. And then March a little lighter. So there is that trend, which I heard mentioned outside and we obviously see some version of that are custody books are similar enough. So I wouldn't read too much into the end of periods or the monthly, I mean deposits tend to have and flow. The discussions we've had with clients are not strictly on price. I mean they shouldn't be and we don't want them to be and in fact clients \u2013 if that's not the client that we are looking for and vice versa. Because that it ends up being hot money, I mean, we do tier pricing, right? Appropriately for larger clients versus smaller ones, we differentiate dollars and other currencies. There are relationships there that we engage in, but it's part of the relationship. It's part of all clients have immediate cash that move them around all the time. They have cash that\u2019s somewhat stable. There\u2019s some cash actually sleep into some money market funds, so we support to our asset management arm. They all have a waterfall of cash and cash availability and our perspective is we should engage with them on that, but prices are result of a lot of other things. It tends to not be something we need it with and we won\u2019t need with it. And in fact, if you look at the underlying pricing and betas and so forth that we described in the U.S. market, which is easiest for all of you to take a look at it, we've actually been disciplined on that deposit pricing and our view as we should continue to do that. Jim Mitchell : Okay, you're saying it's really just incremental demand for you guys. No change in how you're pricing the business? So that's great. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Operator : Next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, I think, I\u2019m going to state of cognitive dissonance over your results. If you can help me out. On the negative side, I mean, you had project Beacon for a few years. And Jay, you've had restructuring all decade. And it's great to hear Beacon savings. But then you have all these expenses for the new business wins and compensation and tax spend. And I thought on purpose of Beacon was to able to put more business on more efficiently and headcount is up 7% year-over-year. That way surpasses its peered, experience growth, certainly at more than I think some had expected this quarter. So that's the negative feeling I have. I guess on the other hand, the positive feeling is double-digit organic client growth in the first quarter, which is great. So I'm trying to reconcile those two thoughts, and I think the answer comes in what you said about the lag between adding new business and getting all the revenues from that. I can't remember when that's had this much of an impact before. So if you can at least quantify the extra expenses this quarter, what kind of revenues you expect or give a little bit of color on that, that would be helpful. Jay Hooley : Sure. Happy to do that, Mike. This is Jay. And I'll quickly wrap this to Eric. We don't measure life by a quarter. We're confidently investing. We're bringing on new clients. Beacon is a multi-year journey. We're tracking against operating leverage goal as we said a few times, we are determined to achieve our fee operating goal in 2018. So things can come and go in a quarter. But we're investing in this business. And we're investing to bring on new clients. We're investing to make sure we have those products that ultimately will differentiate and allow us to continue to grow. And that's not just an asset servicing, that's an asset management. So as Eric referenced and he'll go over again, he can get some episodic revenue and expense situations in a quarter. But we're thrilled with the 5% operating leverage. We're thrilled with our top line. We're pretty happy about our market based activity and the revenues that that's driving. And we're going to make sure that we spend what we need to spend in order to bring those clients in successfully and stay ahead of the pack with regard to completing in these businesses. But, Eric, you might want to? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Mike, I might just add to that, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks both on some of the Q&A, right. The expenses do have a little bit of variability to them and we talk about the ramp up cost, those come and go and that's kind of the installation, right. And some of that can\u2019t be quiet, Beaconize the way, because it takes custom effort to plugs client in, and especially some of our largest clients, remember are acquired for spoke in unique, and so connecting them some effort. I mentioned the sub-custard fees, which were higher this quarter as emerging markets as we sell more flows in emerging markets. We ended up with more volumes there and the market levels take fluent in. And as you say, we continue to invest carefully on the tax spend line, you see us float up purposely because we see headroom on the revenues. We want to spend some on the \u2013 we want to spend some on for client functionality and product development and so forth. I will remind you and the others that first quarter expenses typically are up relative to fourth quarter, right, by about $150 million because of that seasonal effect, the differed incentive comp which comes through, in one way, once a year. So just keep an eye on that as you think about the modeling, right? This is not the new run rate this is exactly not what it is. And then finally, you mentioned the headcount. It's something we actively manage. Overall headcount is up, as you pointed out, 6% to 7% range. High cost location headcount is actually down 3%, which is a purposeful movement from the \u2013 some of our geographies to others. We found the really strong capabilities in our global hubs, which we have around the world in China, India, Poland. And so that's another part of the Beacon effort. But you won't see that in the nominal numbers because of the transition in kind of bubble headcount that you create floats up. Mike Mayo : So one more attempt, can you size at all the disconnect between the extra expenses in the new business? I mean, is it bigger than bread box, is it material? And also, did any asset management business come along with some of the custody wins? Eric Aboaf : I think there's always going to be some expense and revenue variability. I think one way to think about it, Mike, is we gave an operating leverage range for the full year, right? That we committed to, 75 basis points to 150 basis points on a fee operating leverage basis. So on a full year basis, you can imagine there is 75 basis points of variability. On a particular quarter, there can easily be variability of 4 percentage point on expenses, right? One way or the other. And that's just the envelope in which we operate. And what we're trying to do is do the right thing by the business over time by quarter and by year. But we want to do that in a considerate manner. Jay Hooley : And Mike, just on the \u2013 did any asset management business come along this. No, because most of these bigger deals were asset managers themselves as supposed to asset owners. They build us, applicable as a asset management prospect. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Jay, good morning, Eric. Jay, can you share with us on these business wins that you had this quarter, which of course, were outsized? And you shared already that, as the customers dug into the way you guys are operating, they like even more of what they saw. Can you now extrapolate that to pricing? Are you able to price these types of products better or is it still \u2013 I know pricing has always been competitive for as long as you've been at State Street. Or of us are just as competitive as always? Jay Hooley : Yes, let me try to unpack that, Gerard. I think that as a general theme, it's always been true that the more complicated the transaction is, the better the pricing. And that may sound counterintuitive. But I think when you have commoditized activity throughout the bid, there's a lot of people that can compete. And when there is a lot of people, pricing gets more difficult. The \u2013 I'll just give you a couple of it been yet, the one deal that we talked about crosses three different geographies. And it's very complicated. It's a very involved service model where you've got a trading desk in the couple of different locations. You've got product servicing capability in other three locations, it's middle office, back office. So that narrows the field as far as the number of folks that can compete. And as a result, pricing gets better. And I'd say that's the theme generally holds. I think in other vignettes would be \u2013 when someone's doing this work on their own and they're making a decision through outsource it, which is another one of the situations that I had referenced. And that gets a little bit more complicated because try to understand what once internal cost are becomes a factor. But I would say, in that case, it was really less about cost, more about the \u2013 they wanted to go with the risky business of doing fund accounting globally at scale across a number of different products. So I think it still holds true that the more involved the activity is by geographies and bilayers of service moving back to front office, generally the better pricing gets. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful. Gerard Cassidy : No, no. That is. Thank you. And then, Eric, you gave us some good color on your capital ratios and you mentioned about the RWA growth due to higher client overdrafts. A couple of questions of that. Do you know what drove the client overdrafts since they appear to be pretty material since the CET1 ratio did fall sequentially by a fair amount? And then second, when you look at your net interest revenue numbers, the incremental growth that you saw, how much was due to those overdrafts? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Gerard. The overdraft, that totaled about $5 billion on our undrawn committed lines. That\u2019s not a large number. But it\u2019s large relative to what\u2019s typical. We\u2019ve had spikes in overdrafts. You always have them when there are either \u2013 sometimes \u2013 when you have storms and weather events, when you have holidays. This one in particular, if you remember we had Good Friday at the end of the quarter. The markets aren\u2019t \u2013 half the markets are open, half are not open. And so what happens is you kind of have a little bit of a discontinuity for clients who end up ahead in one part of their funds, short on the other and so draw on their lines. Which is why, to be honest, those lines exist. We\u2019re there for our clients. And are there, delighted to help them as needed. It was literally two, three, four, five clients, so a handful. We know them well. We\u2019ve supported them. And they\u2019ve been good to us. So it\u2019s the kind of thing that will just occasionally happen. We don\u2019t expect it every quarter end. But occasionally, when something is in the environment, like in this case, it was a holiday and a quarter end, you have an effect. In terms of NII, there is not a big effect, because remember NII is driven by average balances over the course of one quarter, right? So all 90 days. Not one day. So this wouldn\u2019t have had a big impact positive to NII. This is really a client accommodation that we\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re there for our clients. And one of the reasons we\u2019ve got such a strong balance sheet is so that we can accommodate clients like that. And that\u2019s the kind of expectation they have, for example, on some of the \u2013 some of those larger clients that Jay described have, for a custodial banks like us. Gerard Cassidy : Great. I appreciate the help. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : This question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You touched on some of the proposed regulatory changes earlier. Can you elaborate a bit on, if we get the CCAR changes plus the SLR changes as proposed, what you think your new binding constraints on capital would be? Eric Aboaf : Geoffrey, it\u2019s Eric. I mean that\u2019s been a well studied and modeled endeavor. And I say that in a nice way, because it\u2019s obviously important to us. It\u2019s obviously important to many of you and I think your team and other teams have tried to take that the new CCAR, NPR, the one with the stress capital buffer. And say look, if you had a reformatted stage 3 and all the other bank results back to the last CCAR, how would it laid out. I think as you know, our CCAR binding constraints or let me step back our binding constraints today from a capital perspective start with Tier 1 leverage then depending on kind of where we\u2019re it could be either CET1 or SLR. But that\u2019s kind of core Tier 1 leverage is the binding constraint. I think the early modeling that that we\u2019ve seen and I think the modeling that the industry has done is not particularly different than ours, is that with the FCB and the implementation FCB across the various those five core capital ratios, it seems like the binding constraint will move from the standard Tier 1 leverage to CET1. That should create some amount of capacity. It\u2019s hard to model it precisely, but it seems to create some amount of capacity. And I think others have observed it kind of does the right thing for banks, which is risk related assets should actually be the dominant capital constraint for any bank, right? That\u2019s what a bank is about. The leverage ratio, so there is Tier 1 leverage or SLR should be the backstop. And I think the proposal is both well-intentioned, well designed. There are obviously some refinements that I'm sure we will suggest now there is we'll suggest, but clearly going in the right direction. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. And maybe just another quick one. No outlook slide this time. I know you kind of touched on the outlook in the comments. It feels like there's always been an outlook slide in the State Street deck. So I would love to hear, while you decided not to include that in this time. Jay Hooley : Sure. There's really no messaging at all. I think the full year outlook that we gave in January is fully operative. It was operative in February when we went to an industry conference that was \u2013 it\u2019s operative now. I think what we\u2019re going to do is keep it simple when the outlook changes, will do a new slide and thereby, kind of adjust our messaging. What I will do and I did verbally this quarter is if quarter-on-quarter there are always some seasonality or other swings, I\u2019ll signals those verbally, but no message at all. We're just trying to keep the slide deck compact save an extra tree in the process and \u2013 but the full year outlook commitment that we've made in January, in our minds is a commitment. And our intention is and \u2013 and we have confidence that we'll deliver that. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. Taking one slide off is definitely appreciated. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Jay Hooley : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I just have two questions. One is on the proposed changes that you just discussed. It seems like you have two potential options, obviously, you can do a mix of each, but two basic options. One is, you have more capacity to take in deposits, grow the balance sheet even further or the other one is reduce the press outstanding. And you've got some of the callable press that are out there today. Do you have a preference for either one or could you give us a sense of percentage that you'd want to do with either one? Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it's Eric. I think at this point, we will pretty mature to make a choice there. I think the rules are \u2013 the rules as they stand are obviously constraining in a certain way. I think the actual be the CCAR CV proposal and SLR proposals move in the right direction. There's also the TLAC proposal, which we think is constructive. I mean, not huge amounts, but at least constructive directionally. I think what we'll have to see is how they all come together and remember they may come together little differently in each CCAR period, right. Because the notion of the stress and how the stress impacts us will be different and also, we don't know the Fed models are still fairly opaque, right. We don't know, how the really modeled the balance sheet, how they really model the PPNR given that the signal they're going to change and not grow the balance sheets as much. And so every one of those \u2013 I don't mean to avoid the question, but I think you've got the right levers, which is we could add to the deposit base or other balance sheet kind of leverage balance sheet in terms of activities like some sec lending or enhanced custody qualified. We could reduced the press and some of them are callable today, some of them will be callable next year and then year after and so forth. If that one is the binding constraint, right, will be disciplined around disciplined around RWAs right. And depending on how much capacity want to create there with as we did this quarter with the changes in non-HQLA in the investment portfolio, which have RWA will be under consideration. So in a way, I think there\u2019s a lot of optionality that this would create and help from views at this point, but in my mind, it\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019ll optimize again it\u2019s a better set of \u2013 I think it\u2019s a better designed set of rules. And we\u2019ll have a view of how to do that from \u2013 I think from a shareholder perspective, which is how do we turn that optimization to higher earnings and earnings growth, how do we turn that into capital and capital return, that\u2019ll be the lends that we\u2019ll use. Betsy Graseck : And so, your point you just made, okay, actions taken in the quarter are shifting some of the mix in earning assets from securities to loans, for example. That\u2019s CET1 positive? Is that your point? Eric Aboaf : It\u2019s not dollar-for-dollar, right, because some of those securities are 50% risk-weighted, some closer to 100%. But I\u2019m saying that, that is another lever that we have and in fact if we have the opportunity to trade off client lending right or non-clients securities. There\u2019s clearly a privatization. We have to make sure it comes with good returns or good wallet \u2013 share of wallet from the client. But those are absolutely opportunities that we see and I think what we\u2019re \u2013 because we have we still have non-HQLA in the investment portfolio that always be up to grabs as we optimize for our clients. Betsy Graseck : How much left is that, non-HQLA in the investment portfolio. Eric Aboaf : We sold down about $12 billion on a base of $35 billion. So there\u2019s still $20 billion plus. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Carrier \u2013 our question indeed from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : All right. Thanks guys. Eric, just one quick one. When I look at the fee revenue growth year-over-year you guys had the percent like 5% ex-FX. And then I think ex the revenue recognition accounting that\u2019s 3%, so maybe around 2%. And I know the processing other that kind of add like 3% \u2013 like that could take that 2% to 3% or 4%. It\u2019s seems like that still maybe on the later side just given the market strength that we saw over the last 12 months and then also the volatility that we saw in the quarter that helped the trading side. So I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out, is there anything else that maybe we\u2019re missing \u2013 maybe muted the growth? Or is it really just all that processing and other? Because it still seems maybe a little bit later than you would have expected. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Mike it\u2019s Eric. Let me \u2013 I mean, I think Page 7 of the earnings deck that you all have is probably good one to take a quick look. And I think the \u2013 we\u2019re quite circumspect and how we show fee revenues. We show with and without currency translation, we actually do it on the slide so you can find them and I just encouraging to make sure all the comparisons are apples-to-apples and you\u2019ve got enough footnotes here to adjust for revenue recognition. I think the single biggest driver of our revenues is the servicing fees, right? That\u2019s half of our total revenues, $5 billion a year, and $11 billion, $10 billion to $11 billion of revenue. So I think we\u2019re quite pleased with the 10% normal growth there, the 6% adjusted for currency translation. There is no meaningful revenue recognition in there. So that\u2019s quite solid. And that last year, right that\u2019s half our revenue, last year was up 4% adjusted for currency on a full year basis, and been in about that range. So we\u2019re pleased with that. Every quarter will be a little different there. But that\u2019s a good performance. I think some of the other roles management fees, trading, securities finance came in more less with expectations and I do think processing other is the biggest disconnect remember year ago, we had a gain on sales $30, so that cost up 1.5%. You had the FX swaps delta, which was 22. And then if you still do the comparison between the year-on-year, there is another, in 20, 25 of just small ins and outs that tended to add a positive last year and negative this year. So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re missing anything. I think there\u2019s just some variability here on that line. And when against this quarter it will tend to neutral in other quarters and positive in still others. So overall I think we feel like there is good momentum in the business. We\u2019re pleased with the results, I think the line item geography was a little bit unfortunate on the FX swaps. But nice way in our minds to start the year, a good step-off and we\u2019re obviously working on the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. Mike Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Jay Hooley : Sam, that\u2019s it. Operator : There are no further questions. Jay Hooley : Okay, great. Thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to getting together at the end of the second quarter. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect your phone lines.",

Today's discussion is being broadcast live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be rerecorded or rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. Now I'd like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street. Ilene Fiszel Bieler : Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley; and our CFO, Eric Aboaf, will speak first on our second quarter 2018 earnings highlights followed by this morning's announcement of our agreement to acquire Charles River Development. Presentations on each of these are available for download on the Investor Relations website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, Ronald O'Hanley, President and COO will join Jay and Eric for Q&A. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include adjusted basis and other measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP are available in the addendum included in the 2Q '18 financial materials released today. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may vary materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligations to update them even if our views change. Now let me turn it over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we've announced our second quarter results as well as a definitive agreement to acquire Charles River Development, a premier front office investment management software solutions provider. Our acquisition of Charles River represents a key milestone in our digital and technology transformation aimed at leading the evolution of the investment servicing industry. We're very pleased with this transaction and we'll take you through the details a little later on the call. First, let me cover some of the highlights of the second quarter and then I will turn it over Eric to walk you through the 2Q '18 financials. We'll then discuss the announced acquisition in more detail. Our second quarter and year-to-date 2018 results reflects strength across our asset servicing and asset management businesses as we continue to deepen client relationships, win new business and advance our digital transformation. Second quarter earnings also included substantial EPS growth and increased return on equity. We continue to see strength across our core franchise. Equity market appreciation and new business lifted our assets under custody administration with growth of approximately 9% from second quarter 2017 to nearly $34 trillion. We saw year-to-date servicing commitments of approximately $1.5 trillion, of which approximately $105 billion were won in the second quarter with new business yet to be installed of approximately $300 billion as we installed the large Vanguard win and begin the BlackRock transition. And we are recognized as a number one FX provider to asset managers in the Real Money FX survey with the best overall customer satisfaction rate. State Street Global Advisors finished second quarter 2018 with assets under management levels of $2.7 trillion, up approximately 5% from second quarter 2017, driven by strength in equity markets and ETF flows with continued traction in our low-cost ETF products launched late last year. Furthermore, we continue to realize benefits from Beacon, our multi-year program to digitize our business and drive new solutions and innovations for our clients while creating greater efficiencies for State Street. We achieved a net benefit of approximately $60 million in both the first and second quarters of this year and now expect full year 2018 savings to be approximately $200 million, which exceeds our previously announced guidance of $150 million. Additionally, our ability to deliver new tools and functionality is proving to be a meaningful factor in point of differentiation and client decisions as demonstrated by the Vanguard win. Building on the success of Beacon, we are monetizing our digitization accomplishments and reducing manual processes. We are continuing to focus on achieving greater organizational effectiveness and streamlining as we move into the next phase of opportunities, which Eric will discuss further.  To conclude, I'm very pleased with our financial performance to date. Revenue growth was strong, driven by both fee revenue and net interest income, reflecting the higher U.S. market interest rates, continued market appreciation, new business wins and higher trading activity. We remain focused on expense management, which you saw this quarter as we actively calibrated cost to revenues while prudently investing in new products and solutions. We also declared a common stock dividend of $0.42 per share in the quarter. And yesterday we declared a 3Q '18 dividend of $0.47 per share, representing an increase of 12% from 2Q '18 dividend. Importantly, we continue to be well positioned to achieve our financial objectives in 2018, including delivering full year positive fee operating leverage. And with that, over to you, Eric? Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4 where I will begin my review of 2Q '18 and year-to-date results. We have highlighted a few notable items, which we believe provide investors insight into specific initiatives as well as our underlying business trends. As you can see on the right, 2Q '18 results included net charge of $77 million or $0.17 per share consisting of $61 million of compensation expenses related to the organizational realignment and management delayering and $16 million of occupancy costs as we continue right size our real estate footprint. I'll also remind you that the quarters of 2018 reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. This has increased both total fee and total expense by $70 million year-over-year but as EBIT neutral. Now let me move to Slide 5 where most of my comments will focus on year-over-year results. 2Q '18 EPS increased to $1.88, up 23% compared to 2Q '17. Excluding the $0.17 related to the repositioning charge, 2Q '18 EPS increased to $2.05. Both 2Q '18 and year-to-date results reflect continued strength across servicing fees, management fees and trading services as well as continued improvement in net interest income supported by the higher interest rate environment. We continue to prudently manage expenses related to the revenue environment as demonstrated by an increase of 1 percentage point in 2Q '18 pretax margin. We achieved positive operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points compared to 2Q '17. Fee operating leverage was negative largely due to lower 2Q '18 securities and seasonality relative to 2Q '17, which were up 1.1 percentage points. Return on equity reached 14.7%, up 2.1 percentage points relative to 2Q '17. Now let me turn to Slide 6 to review AUCA and AUM performance. 2Q '18 AUCA of $33.9 trillion increased 9% from 2Q '17. Growth was primarily driven by a combination of market appreciation, strong new business and client activity especially in EMEA and our middle office outsourcing business. AUCA increased 2% sequentially driven by the insulation of a significant portion of the bank Vanguard in the first quarter offset by the previously announced BlackRock transition, which is about 50% complete and lower market levels. In our Asset Management business, AUM increased 4% from 2Q '17, driven by market appreciation and higher yielding ETF inflows partially offset by outflows from lower fee institutional index assets in a subdued market environment. Please turn to Slide 7, where I will review 2Q '18 revenue. Total fee revenue increased 6% relative to 2Q '17 reflecting solid performance across most of our businesses. Let me take you through some of the details. Servicing fees increased 3%, reflecting higher global equity markets, increased client activity and new business, partially offset by continued modest hedge fund outflows. On a sequential basis, servicing fees decreased due impart the lower global equity markets as well as the transaction of the previously announced BlackRock assets. Management fees increased 17%, benefiting from higher global equity markets as well as approximately $45 million related to the new revenue recognition standard. Management fees decreased on a sequential basis, reflecting lower global equity markets as well as net outflows in line with muted industry close this quarter. Trading services revenue increased 9%, primarily due to higher FX client volumes, driven by the depth of our FX capabilities and platforms, which continue to differentiate our offerings. Securities finance fees decreased, driven by lower seasonal activity into 2Q '18 relative to 2Q '17. Moving the Slide 8, NII was up 15% on a GAAP basis and then increased 19 basis points on a fully tax-equivalent basis relative to 2Q '17. NII benefited from higher U.S. interest rates and discipline liability pricing, partially offset by a mix shift to HQLA assets. NIM increased due to higher NII and a smaller interest earnings asset basis we reposition the investment portfolio at the end of first quarter. Deposit betas for the U.S. interest-bearing accounts continue to move a bit higher but stayed in line with our expectation. We continue to expect good growth in NII. Now let me turn to Slide 9 to review 2Q '18 expenses. Year-on-year expenses increased $21 million due to currency translation and $70 million related to the new accounting for revenue recognition. When considering these two effects, year-over-year expenses were well controlled, increasing just 2% from the year ago quarter as we actually manage the cost base and calibrated to revenues this quarter. Relative to 1Q '18 expenses decreased 4%, which included 1Q seasonally elevated compensation costs and the 2Q management delayering charge. Excluding these 2 items underlying expenses were well controlled, decreasing 1% sequentially. A top priority continues to be the actively managed expenses relative to revenues. From a line item perspective, let me cover the year-over-year trends quickly. Compensation employee benefits decreased 1% relative to 2Q \u201817 due to continued Beacon savings and lower performance related incentive compensation, partially offset by costs to support new business. Transaction processing increased relative to 2Q '17 reflecting higher client volumes and market levels as well as the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. Information systems increased relative to 2Q '17 as a result of higher Beacon related investments. Occupancy costs were up compared to 2Q '17, primarily driven by $16 million in the occupancy expense charge related to the continued rightsizing of our footprint, partially offset by a few discrete items that will not reoccur. Other expenses increased primarily due the new accounting for revenue recognition. Our intention is to keep second half expenses roughly in line with first half as of 1Q '18 seasonally deferred compensation bump. Let me now move to Slide 10 to review our progress on State Street Beacon. On the left side of the slide, you can see that we achieved almost $16 million in net Beacon sales this quarter by optimizing our core servicing business, transforming our IT infrastructure and by gaining efficiencies within the corporate functions and SSGA. Notably, we now expect to realize approximately $200 million savings in 2018, which exceeds our previously announced guidance of $150 million. Shifting to the right side of the slide, building on the success of Beacon, we are now transitioning to the next phase of efficiency initiatives that come as we begin to implement the organizational changes we announced in November, when we moved from a regional product structure to a single global highly functionalized business. We've thus recorded a $77 million repositioning charge related to management delayering as we implement this organizational change. We expect this repositioning charge to payback in about a year. Moving to the next slide, let me touch on our balance sheet. Our capital ratios remain healthy and all ratios increased. Also, as you are aware, last month, our 2018 capital plan received a non-objection from the Fed as well as some taxable conditions. The non-objection was based on our CCAR submission including a strategic change that contemplated the acquisition of Charles River as a potential transaction and the related capital ratio. Moving to the Slide 12, let me briefly summarize results. Both 2Q and year-to-date reflect continued business momentum resulting in year-to-date EPS growth of 30% and an increase in ROE of 2.5 points. Year-to-date total revenue increased 10% supporting over 3 percentage points of positive leverage as well as an increase in pretax margin of over 2 percentage points. Before turning the call back to Jay, let me briefly touch on our current outlook, which excludes any contribution from today's announced acquisition of Charles River Development. We remain on track to deliver on our 2018 financial objectives, including fee revenue growth of 7% to 8%, fee operating leverage of 75 to 150 basis points, NII growth of 10% to 13% and a tax rate of 15% to 17%. It remains the top priority to actively manage the expense base relative to revenue. And you can expect us to continue to do so. Now, let me turn the call back to Jay to start the discussion of our acquisition of Charles River, and then I'll be back to take you through the transaction details. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Eric. And let me ask everyone to please turn to Slide 3 in the second section of today's presentation on our acquisition of Charles River Development. Today's announcement represents an important milestone in the digital and technological transformation aimed at providing clients with differentiated solutions. And importantly, this transaction will allow State Street to address a fragmented and underserved approximately $8 billion front office revenue pool opportunity. Against the backdrop of significant industry change, institutional investors are relentlessly focusing on delivering better investment returns. At the same time, these investors face increasing complexity and regulatory expectations coupled with the needs to upgrade technology and manage costs while still focusing on product or geographic expansion. To address these challenges, they want solutions that add value across the front, middle and back-office. We believe that the combination of State Street and Charles River will create an unparalleled platform for our client that uniquely positions us as the first ever global front, middle and back-office solution providers in the industry. Importantly, our platform will be interoperable, meaning that will connect and exchange data with other industry platforms and providers as well as the client's proprietary systems. Charles River provides leading investment management software solutions to institutional asset managers, insurers, pension funds and wealth managers with a single investment platform for improved decision making, better risk management and greater efficiency while lowering costs. Building on our digital efforts, Charles River capabilities also include a comprehensive suite of advanced data management services. In addition the strategic benefits I just mentioned and Charles River's leading position in the industry, we believe the transaction is financially compelling. We expect to recognize significant cost and revenue synergies that will drive attractive long-term financial returns for State Street shareholders. In addition, the transaction generates an internal rate of return of approximately 14% with cost synergies only and greater than 28% with full costs in revenue synergies, excluding our cost of capital -- exceeding our cost of capital. Moving to Slide 4. Let me spend some time further highlighting Charles River\u2019s business model. As I mentioned, Charles River is a leading provider of investment management software solutions, and importantly, the acquisition provides a leading front office platform and builds on our digitization efforts. Charles River\u2019s capabilities also include a comprehensive suite of advanced data management services. Charles River has more than 300 clients, many of whom are also State Street clients with an aggregate asset under management of over $25 trillion. Revenue was $311 million in 2017 and notably 85% of Charles River's revenue base is recurring, providing a stable revenue stream, which is not dependent on market levels. On the bottom right of the slide, you can see Charles River\u2019s broad client base and business segments. Charles River's reach by market segment in region is highly aligned with our target markets. We\u2019ll also allowing opportunity to both expand share of wallet as well as the potential to add new clients. Notably, the acquisition will also enable us to meaningfully address the large adjacent revenue pool of the wealth advisor market. Let me briefly highlight how the acquisition enables us to create an integrated front to back platform by combining State Street's data and analytics and those are Charles River and third party providers. On Page 5, you can see what we mean by an integrated platform that optimizes the front, middle and back office. I\u2019m often asked about our front, middle and back office capabilities. I think this slide helps bring those categories to life. On the left side of the slide you can see key activities within the front, middle and back office. Charles River's core front office capabilities for the investment management industry include portfolio modeling, construction and analysis, trade management and execution, order generation and pre-trade compliance aimed at an approximately $8 billion front office market. Charles River\u2019s capabilities expanded to the middle office comprised of functions such as risk monitoring, client reporting, and post-trade support areas that complement our existing middle office offerings. As you\u2019re well aware, State Street\u2019s front, middle and leading back office competencies begin with data and analysis. It include middle office functions such as investment accounting as well as core back office functions of custody fund administration and fund accounting. On the far right of the slide, you can see that the acquisition will create a powerful new combination. Charles River enables State Street to further expand meaningfully into the front office and ultimately deliver an integrated front to back office platform, a compelling proposition to help those client's rationalize front office systems, enhance investment and risk management, extract meaningful insights from data and access additional sources of liquidity. With that, let me turn it over to Eric to further highlight why the acquisition is a compelling strategic opportunity. Eric? Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Jay. Let me review the deal terms and go into some detail on the points that Jay just highlighted. As you can see on Slide 6, the purchase price is $2.6 billion. This will be financed by sustaining buybacks from 2Q to 4Q '18, which is worth $950 million and the balance will be financed with roughly two thirds common equity and a third preferred stock. We will look to offset the preferred by a similarly size redemption is more expenses preferred in late 2019. Lastly, we expect the transition to close by 4Q '18. We are paying an attractive price for our premier front-office franchise. The PE with just cost synergies is 14 times and with full synergies is 10.5 times. The IRR in the transaction, which is a good benchmark on how we think about deploying capital, is about 14% with just cost synergies alone. This exceeds our cost of equity, which makes us confident an attractive use of capital. With full cost in revenue synergies the IRR is over 20%. The financial metrics of this transaction are attractive because we're bringing together two leading companies with highly complementary product offerings focused on exactly the same top-tier client base. So first, we expect Charles River to help accelerate State Street's annual fee growth by 75 to 125 basis points as we deliver on revenue synergies worth $80 million of EBIT by 2021, which I will detail out in a moment. Notably, Charles River's significant recurring revenue streams adds to and diversifies our current servicing fee revenue. Second, we planned to create efficiencies that will ramp up overtime, which results in cost synergies of $60 million in 2021. EPS accretion is also expected within 2 years. Moving to Slide 7, our combined client base will provide a natural opportunity to gain share of wallet among State Street and Charles River's existing clients, leveraging our platforms and delivering several additional services. To level set here at State Street we'll ready to serve about 75% or 155 of the top 220 institutional asset managers where we have senior relationships with CEOs, CIOs, COOs and business heads. Only half of the 155 are served by Charles River today as we detailed in the summary note at the bottom of the page. So let me outline several areas of opportunity. First, we can help Charles River to grow their client base by leveraging our 155 top tier relationships, which could significantly increase their penetration of our top clients. Second, we have the ability to further expand the existing relationships with more than 70 shared top-tier clients, which provide us with a unique opportunity to rollout a true front, middle and back-office platforms. No other custody bank can do this. Third, with this combination, we have the opportunity to operate in State Street platform to mid-sized institutions that represent the additional 45% of global asset management outside the top 220 institutions. Lastly, another exciting opportunity is to scale Charles River's established presence in the high-growth wealth management in private banking space. Here we can also leverage Charles River's Wealth Management solution to expand State Street's costing and accounting services into this attractive segment. Turning to Slide 8, let me provide a bit more details on how we will execute on these opportunities and the expected revenue in cost synergies as a result of the enhanced platform. By 2021, we are targeting annual revenue synergies to deliver EBIT of $75 million to $85 million and annual cost synergies of $55 million to $65 million. On the left side of the slide, you can see the components of the targeted revenue synergies. We have outlined these opportunities across five key categories each of which has a specific execution plan. $70 million to $75 million of the expected revenue synergies are driven by upgrading about 10 Charles River clients from client-sold software to the State Street Cloud and introducing Charles River to 10 to 15 State Street clients. We expect $55 million to $60 million of synergies to expanding our core, middle and back office services into Charles River\u2019s existing base of top-tier and midsized clients. Approximately $70 million of revenue synergies are driven by expanding State Street data and analytic offerings. Gaining significant front office capabilities here supports our current front office data offerings allowing us to accelerate the growth of our global exchange business. This is particularly powerful for our joint clients. $35 million to $40 million will be achieved by integrating State Street\u2019s premier trading platforms FX Connect, Currenex, Fund Connect into the part of our client investment workflows with Charles River\u2019s platform, driving increased transaction volumes and trading fee revenues. And another $30 million to $35 million by penetrating the wealth management segment, which I just described. For each of these revenue opportunities, we conservatively assume product delivery cost base on fully loaded margins. Moving to the right of the slide, there are three main drivers contributing to the target $55 million to $65 million of cost synergies. First, we expect to drive operational efficiencies by streamlining existing custody, accounting and middle office operations lowering unit costs by $35 million. Second, Charles River enables State Street's retire legacy systems to achieve an additional $10 million to $15 million savings. And lastly, we expect $10 million to $15 million in expense savings related to the implementation of Charles River\u2019s front office solutions within SSGA. This is a sort of benefit that many clients will see. And we've detailed this opportunity in the appendix. All of the savings can be realized from State Street\u2019s existing cost base. Turning to Slide 9. Let me wrap up by highlighting the strategic and financial points to support the value that Charles River provides the State Street's businesses and shareholders. Overall, this transaction represents a significant milestone in our technology transformation, which creates a first ever front, middle, back office solutions and generates attractive financial returns. We are expanding into an $8 billion revenue pool, which is fragmented and underserved today. We expect to accelerate State Street's fee revenue growth as we round out asset management and asset services with a third nature of business. We expect EPS accretion within 2 years of the acquisition supported by various specific revenue and cost synergies. And while times accretion is a bit outside our traditional financial envelope, the intrinsic value and IRR are consulate above the cost of capital with cost synergies alone. Let me now turn it back over to Jay and we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Eric. And Lisa, we are now open for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So question on Charles River deals. With Eze Castle and Bloomberg being other big independent players, I\u2019m curious on why timing is now for vertical integration or I don\u2019t know vertical is the right word, but the integration of front-to-middle-to-back. And then I\u2019m curious on how pricing will work? Will Charles River continue to charge explicitly or will this being woven into the overall State Street relationship pricing? Jay Hooley : Yes, Glenn, this is Jay. Let me start that. I might ask Ron to comment as well. There is a clear trend, and it\u2019s not a new trend in the world of front, middle, back to create more integration. You mentioned Eze and Bloomberg and BlackRock. We work with BlackRock on a similar solution where we were integrating front, middle and back office. Investment managers are under considerable pressure to get more efficient to gain greater access to data, to do more things for the single touch. So I think this front, middle, back integration is clearly the wave of the future. And up till now, it's been it's all fragmented with the custodians going into the middle office, but not all the way into the front office, you got some front office players working with middle and back-office players. So I think it's very clearly the direction of travel in this industry. And it will come together probably overtime even more so. I think it's also true that we mentioned the word interoperability, which is we have a series of clients and now with Charles River we have a combined series of clients that we can better link together the three components of middle, front and back office. But we also will continue to work with Bloomberg and we've got a significant partnership with BlackRock and Aladdin, where we're the largest custodian in integrating the lab provider and service. So it's going to happen in different forms. One last point I would mention is that one of the things that led us to Charles River was the State Street Global Advisors who a couple of years ago was looking to rationalize their front-office, which is something that most firms are in some form of doing. And landed on Charles River and that's what led us to Charles River. And SSGA will be one of the places where we'll integrate and where we'll control the front, middle and back-office to create a streamline interface, which will not only create efficiencies, free of data, but give us access to the front-office for the first time for some of our liquidity products and trading products. Now, would you add anything to that Ron? Ronald O'Hanley: Sure, Glenn. This is Ron. What I would add to Jay's comments are that, in terms of your question on timing, it's a combination of pull from clients and where we are in our own digital and data journey. On that pull from clients, you need to be very well aware of this. Large asset managers and large asset owners that act like asset managers are operating with very complicated both technology and operations stacks. And there is a strong desire to simplify, a strong desire to get more straightforward processing and a strong desire to make better use of data in a timely way, which leads to the second point in timing. As you know we've been on this road now for a while with Beacon and there's a lot of things that Beacon is driving. But one of the things that it's driving is our ability to take client data and present it back to the clients in a highly usable form whether to reinjected back into the investment process for analytics et cetera. So it's this data-enabled platform that will work with Charles River, but as importantly as Jay said we'll interoperate with other providers because what that means not all investment managers are going to want the same thing, but the one thing they do want is some kind of platform that enables them to work with their providers of choice and not have to deal with the number of reconciliations. Jay Hooley : And Glenn, let me just pick up the second question which was about pricing. We will keep Charles River as a standalone entity their uptake. There's a convenience of their local. They're right at the street from us. And it will continue to be Charles River, a State Street company. And in fact, we will combine some of our existing capabilities largely in the GX world into Charles River to make sure that from a pricing standpoint that is for the state and set of capabilities, which will have distinctive pricing separate from our middle and back office capabilities. Glenn Schorr : One last one, Eric. What cost of capital used in the IRR calculation? Eric Aboaf : Just typical 10% to be conservative, so we think that\u2019s appropriate for our business and then the other important part of the model of the IRR is always professional growth rate, which we tagged at 4%, which I think is overall on the low end of the range. But we thought, when we do these kinds of deals, we need to do it conservatively. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Question for you just as around the capital side of things here, Eric. I was just wondering if you could walk us through. What happens to capital ratios on a pro forma basis at closing? And just wondering you\u2019re moving off the buyback in the 950 for this year. Why the decision to issue rather than just not buyback going forward in terms of saving that extra capital? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure. The capital ratios are actually embedded in our CCAR submission. So you can actually take the controls as a pro forma. Obviously, I think we came in a little better in the second quarter than expected and that\u2019ll flow through. When we, you can imagine this deal has been in process for a series of months and quarters that predated our CCAR submission. So as we were gearing up for the April, the early April submission of CCAR, this was a strong possibility but by no means assure. And so what we felt we should do Ken is to submitted as one of those strategic changes that is the specific form in the Fed filings for that. And effectively do it on auto call a capital ratio neutral basis. And so that\u2019s why you see to spend buyback plus issues some amount of common equity plus top-up with preferred to get the $2.6 billion. On a Tier 1 ratio basis is the neutral -- on a leverage ratio basis it'll be neutral, on a set one ratio basis it'll be down by roughly about 50 basis points literally because of the preferred piece of the stack. Ken Usdin : And then just a choice between issuing versus just not buying back into next year CCAR, just -- how do you, what\u2019s the economics of that decision? Eric Aboaf : It\u2019s not dramatically different. There\u2019s a little bit of question, underwriter fees and discount when you go out to the market. On the other hand, we felt like it\u2019s important to get on with this acquisition and to bring it together by the end of the year. And to be honest, we wanted to -- we\u2019re also signaling that we\u2019re confident in our earnings stream and our go forward earnings stream. And so while we temporarily suspend the buyback this past quarter and then two more quarters, we're fully committed to continue to return capital to shareholders on a go forward basis. Ken Usdin : Okay. And I\u2019ll just one more on the capital front middle and I\u2019ll stand aside. Just on coming back to CCAR this year and the counterparty number, which was candid like you guys have to go back and just look through that more. Can you tell us about the backend forth about that? What do you think was in the results? What do you have to do now? What is it mean if anything as you go forward? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, on the counterparty condition, I think the first observation which is make -- which I think the Fed made in its summary is they clearly felt comfortable enough with our capital planning processes, our management processes, our risk processes, our business processes to give us non-objection. So I think the kind of the strategic clarity is there. And in fact this was also embedded in this mission was an acquisition. And so they felt, I think, you have to ask them obviously, but it's our understanding is they signal with their actions which were quite positive. They have asked us to do some more work on the counterparty loss paths. We've obviously been doing that since we've seen in January, so that's not new. We've started by adding more measurement and scenarios to our kind of pool of our arsenal of monitoring mechanisms we're sharing that with the Fed. And I think we'll refine the exact deliverables that we have over the next month or two and then execute on those in line with their expectations. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hey good morning guys. A couple of more deal related questions. I guess the first one on Charles River, pretty robust operating income growth over the last couple of years. It looks like 11% CAGR. Can you guys talk a little bit about what do you contemplate for their growth to be on a standalone basis in your kind of accretion math through 2020? And then secondly, maybe sentimented on just the nature of the contracts they have with clients kind of like what's the average length? And is there anything of the contracts related to change of control that could lead them to negotiate, so just kind of thinking for any sort of revenue attrition you might have on the back of this. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Alex, it's Eric. Let me start on this one. So as you've observed and we showed in the deck, we had nice top-line revenue growth, which obviously was a sweet part of our interest in them as a franchise. They are kind of leading an established franchise but they have nice growth dynamics. And that's largely because they operate in a fragmented space, right, a typical, call it $500 billion institutional asset manager may have 15 or 20 systems and subsystems and providers in everything from portfolio constructions, the compliance, the straight quarter optimization and routing to risk measurement. So it's a space that in our minds is open to strong growth by a leading player. And that's why we chose Charles River as we've been watching and scanning this space. If you then take that and say, well, how do we think about the revenue growth synergies? Revenue synergies, we feel deliver about $80 million of EBIT over the first three years and that comes from about $270 million of top-line revenue. And then obviously we try to be conservative with the cost to serve. If you go to the buckets of revenue synergies on Page 8 that we've provided and kind of take through them, I guess, maybe the way I would answer your questions the first bucket and the last bucket are really the on Bluefin revenue synergies, so together about $100 million. And second, third and fourth of the middle buckets are really about the -- on State Street revenues. And so if you think about it that way what we\u2019re effectively doing is taking Charles River, it\u2019s got a revenue growth rate, at least based on the history, of about 7% a year. We\u2019re effectively doubling that to about 14% based on the kind of on Bluefin or on Charles River assumptions. Jay Hooley : Alex, the thing, this is Jay. A couple of things I\u2019d add to that is, there were very few if any client termination clauses in the contracts. That\u2019s the legal side of it. I\u2019d say the non-legal side of it is, as you might expect, these are disruptive things if you wanted to change and unwind. So we think there\u2019s more than ample of time not only with the introduction of State Street as a significant provider of resources to Charles River and with knowledge of most of these clients anyway to not only secure what we have but to expand upon it. Alex Blostein : And then just another clean up question. When it comes to synergies, I think in the deck, you guys gave 2020 run rate numbers for revenues and costs came from a timing perspective. How quickly do you guys expect how to come in? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it\u2019s Eric. We didn't go into details of that because obviously it\u2019s going to play out overtime. What I tell you is the synergies ramp up, it\u2019s not completely linear and on the other hand it\u2019s not a hockey stick either. Obviously the first year it takes a little time to get things going, in the second year we expect a real significant chunk of expenses. So that tends to lead a little bit relative to what I might describe is a linear trend line. Revenues will go the other way early year's bills then they build on subsequent years. So hopefully that\u2019s enough just to help with the modeling. Operator : Your next question comes to from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Quick question here on -- as a follow-up Ken\u2019s question on the common. Deal close is expected in 4Q, but do you have any timing for when you expect to issue this common and preferred and what you\u2019d expect the cost of preferred would be? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it\u2019s Eric. I think because we\u2019re now in this open period here, I think the larger would resist if I ask them to name a day, a week, a month. So I think we\u2019ll be on the market in Q4. It's an obviously, we\u2019re watching markets to find a good opportunity. On the preferred, I think you could probably take some of the current yields and some of the new preferred issued by other similarly sized banks or you can look at some of ours that are out there and currently some of the required yields. We do think that the market is favorable relative to some of our historic; perhaps, we've got some that are callable now. We have some that become callable over the next year and obviously we\u2019d be inclined to call the more expensive ones there. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that. And then thinking about one more here on the deal. The rise on revenue synergies is one that financial investors usually don't greet with open arms. So could you give us maybe a little bit more color on how you intend to insulate Charles River from maybe some of the pricing dynamics that we typically see in the trust bank world? How do you intend to allow for -- is the idea here that end-to-end will allow for greater insulation on the trust bank side? And how is it that you -- where do you expect the relationship to be owned if you're coming in front to back? Is now the ownership going to shift from the back office on the client side to the front office? Do you have any visibility on that? Thanks. Jay Hooley : Let me start that one Brian, this is Jay. I would start with the point I made earlier which is while State Street is acquiring Charles River. Charles River as an entity will continue to exist as an independent entity with the connection with State Street. And in fact as I mentioned, we're going to push more of the product capability this front-office leading into Charles River. So the first thing is clear separation. I think the Charles River has a series of relationships where State Street is not involved. And then State Street and Charles River have a number of -- a large number of clients where we jointly provide services. And I think we'll sought through to determine where the better relationship is. I would say generally, you'd lean more towards the front-office. And investment management firms, well, if those relationships are different the front-office tends to carry a little bit more weight. And one of the things that beyond the front, middle, back connection, which I think we all understand, I think one of the things that I think will provide upside to this deal overtime is gaining access to the front-office platform world. Some of the new innovations that we've created in our markets business around peer-to-peer lending, access to one button touch, access to specials and securities lending, to the extent that we can stream those all the way through on a highly automated basis. It's going to be differentiated. So I think the relationships will go through one-by-one determine where the lead is, but my leaning is towards the front-office from the standpoint of where the lead relationship would be. Ron or Eric, would you add anything to that? Ronald O'Hanley: Well, the only thing I would add to that is that, I think it's important to remember the pricing was all about value delivered. And there is euro familiar as anybody with the challenges that investment managers are facing. And to the extent to which this platform is delivering value enabling them to not only cover costs but to streamline and improve their own investment process. We don't see this necessarily being subject to the same kind of commodities like pricing pressure that you see in other areas. Brennan Hawken : Yes, I appreciate that Ron. It's just I wonder about once it's all under the same roof keeping it separated, but seems like you guys are going to try to keep separate at least initially. That's at least where it seems to me. Ronald O'Hanley: Correct. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks. And then how about we take a refreshment twist to actually the results here this quarter? Deposit costs ticked up a bit. It looks like 13 basis points for the total deposit base. I believe it\u2019s roughly two thirds for you guys, deposits that are in U.S. dollar. So is there any noise in that, Eric? And how much of that should we attribute to the U.S. dollar deposits? And am I right in the two thirds number? Eric Aboaf : I think the -- just to go outright, I think, deposit rates came up as if they continue to raise rates. I think these are well within the bounds of our expectations. The U.S. interest bearing deposit data was just a snitch over 50%, which we think at this point in the rate cycle, was makes a good bit of sense. We need to share some of the benefits of the industry environment with our clients. We need to keep it, sells as well to continue to build our returns. I think we\u2019re seeing good activity with clients on the balance sheet. And so, we\u2019re very well engaged with them. And I guess the other metric to keep an eye on is the non-interest bearing deposits. And we continue to see the slow rotation, but that continues to move more slowly than our internal model. So I think all-in-all, a good quarter on interest-bearing deposits given we\u2019re in the middle of the cycle. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect NII to continue to build from here. Brennan Hawken : I\u2019m sorry, Eric. Could you walk me to the math on that just over 50% because the 13-basis-point increase would -- I would assume applies just to the U.S. dollar deposit. So I would think that based upon that the math would drive that deposit ratio -- that deposit data higher for the U.S. deposit? Isn't that right or is there some other noise that\u2019s in 13 bps? Eric Aboaf : There\u2019s more to that. So if you and others actually go through the average interest rate earning balance sheet in our financial supplemented Page 7 for those, but deep into this. I\u2019d actually take a look at U.S. versus non-U.S. This is a domiciled view but it\u2019s directionally right. So I focus on the U.S. rate, which went from 28 basis points to 37 basis points. If you actually have all the internal data, which effectively here the data on that was effectively 50% for U.S. interest bearing deposits. Just remember the non-U.S. domiciled line has the FX swap costs in there, right, because we\u2019ve now -- in that line with footnoted at the bottom of page. And so you kind of have to -- if you want to start with that, you got to back those out and then split it U.S. non-U.S. But I just go to the U.S. line because it\u2019s the simple and more direct approach and we\u2019re off of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Mike Carrier : Eric, just maybe one on the core business first. Just on the asset servicing fees, it seems like sequentially it became a little weaker, I know you had the international and their currencies weight on it. But just wanted to understand maybe for the quarter like the timing of both -- like the BlackRock and Vanguard assets, like how much was that in there and just trying to get you maybe more of a run rate. I know that\u2019s tough with the markets in the FX, but just maybe anything that kind of weight on that besides the beta? Eric Aboaf : Sure. It\u2019s -- let me just kind of give it to you sort of broadly and then try to be as specific as possible that provides so that we\u2019ve historically felt. So I'm not appropriate to go client-by-client, win-by-win, transition-by-transition, but let me see if I can be helpful here. I think I was trying to be clear that the quarter-on-quarter change in servicing fee revenue, which is down about $20 million, was a mix of market effects and this transition of BlackRock, which we had announced, I think over a year ago. And there is always a mix of other factors, right. There is kind of underlying product mix, there is client flows, there is a better shift between the U.S. and EM and vice versa, and there is always a set of new business and business flowing through. I think just for this time and I'll probably not be terribly attempted to do this every quarter, but the effect of the BlackRock transition for this quarter was about half of the $20 million and I think that can kind of be at the least the starting point if you think about the results. Mike Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more on the Charles River acquisition. So on the revenue, on synergies, like strategically or conceptually that can make sense. Just wondering like when you come up with those revenue opportunities, how much of those revenues are like new for the client, meaning new services versus how much are they currently using another provider? And when you make that assumption at the potentially shift into the Phase 3. What is that like maybe the pricing assumption? You mean you have to be more competitive to kind of allure them away from another provider. And then I don't think and this will be a huge issue just given like Charles River's client base, but from a concentration issue, when you're doing the back-to-middle-front-office, do you run into any of those issues similar to, I mean it's very different, but just similar to like the BlackRock, your move in terms of some of these assets? Jay Hooley : Hey, Mike, this is Jay. I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Eric. Your first question which is, are these new services that they're not currently employing today? I would say largely they're not. They're using either someone else's platform or someone else's custodian or the trading with some other counterparties. So most of the synergies on the State Street side, which are almost two thirds of the revenue synergies, are areas where they've got a counterparty today who have some sense of changing out of middle-office or back-office provider of State Street becomes like a custodian or State Street has part of the custody work. And we can show a more integrated value proposition as we've seen with some consolidation that's likely that we'll see more of that. I think to the extent that we can stream trading and lending and other credit activity from the front all the way through the back, which doesn\u2019t exists today, but will exist once we get in and wire that together. They're trading with other counterparties they'll be compelled I think to trade more with State Street given the simplicity of execution and lowering of risks. So I think a lot of this one is being done today somewhere else. And the transition and the lift it would cause one to make a change depends on the different services but it's not extraordinary in any of those different areas. Eric Aboaf : And let me just add, it's Eric. I think if you go through the synergies, I think we tried to put some real detail on Page 8a. I think there is really a nice mix of different tax fix here. And that's why I like as a CFO, because then we\u2019ll be able to execute and measure progress on every one of them. So take the first one, scaling the Charles River front-office solutions. Some of that is taking their existing clients and moving them into our cloud and that\u2019s software as a service. And so, that\u2019s just -- there\u2019s an old way to do it in a new way. And we\u2019re going to be able to accelerate that because we give Charles River kind of an institutional credibility, right that they may not have had, right, when you\u2019re out there offering software to large asset managers. Those large asset managers want another, you\u2019ll be here for decades and decades and they\u2019ll get the next releases and so forth. So that\u2019s part of the way this works. And then there\u2019s a series of these where they have other providers, they tend to be smaller. I mentioned for the typical $500 billion asset manager is still often 20 providers, but there\u2019s a range, it could be 25 or 30. And it tends not to be a price sell because this is a software service, there\u2019s implementation, there\u2019s functionality. And if you think about the CIOs and front office portfolio managers, their expectations are quite high. And I think this relative to some of the other services in the market. This is kind of front office capability, functionalities, the narrowing performance attribution where folks want the functionality, and I think, are willing to pay a fair price. And so, I think this is one where we\u2019ve taken those kinds of risks into account in the synergy models but are quite comfortable. The one other thing that I\u2019ve mentioned because we haven\u2019t talked about it that much is that we have put a global franchise here and Charles River has a nice U.S. franchise, I think, it developing European and Asia franchise. And if you think again, the institutional brand and reputational backing that we can bring to them as we help scale that international expansion is another part. I\u2019ve not kind of overlaid that, but there is an overlay behind it in the execution plans against these synergies that really have a progression that as I\u2019ve built out in Europe and Asia. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe just to start off with the Charles River, so just looking at that in the front-office pool that you\u2019ve identified about $8 billion and Charles River share that looks like around with the $311 million, just under 4%. And then looking at the revenue synergies that you\u2019ve outlined some of that obviously is State Street revenue. But you still only imply maybe a 5% to 6% market share of that $8 billion pool. So can you talk about, you mentioned obviously and we all know this industry is incredibly fragmented and has historically been driven by sort of traders' decisions in usage of the products. Can you talk about the potential of actually increasing that market share and much more significantly? If you really believe that\u2019s a decision making move to the corporate office of the asset managers where we'll be looking to really synergize this suppose to sort of on the trading course? Ron O'Hanley: Brian, this is Ron. We're -- we want us to be conservative here in terms of how we think about the acquisition and not overstretched. But I think that you actually implied in your question is the answer. There is -- we see this everyday with our clients. There is a real desire to simplify to take the complexity out of the fact even amongst the largest asset managers who by any definition are exceeding what they're thinking about is how do we position ourselves for scale. So I think you're right that overtime particularly assuming that we deliver on this vision of a data-enabled platform that's interoperable with our technology and other technologies that the client might choose to use. We think there is a lot of upside here. I'd also agree with your point that the decisions -- these front-office decisions are moving in many respects at least they're centralizing to the CIO as oppose the individual portfolio manager decisions. And in many cases that's a CEO, CIO and Chief Operations Officer kind of decision that again is around the idea of simplification and long term scalability. Brian Bedell : And the regulatory approvals, who else is -- which do you need -- which regulators need approvals some of this. Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric, just a customary approvals from the Fed. And now there is obviously we've been approved this and include as I mentioned in CCAR and received the non-objection. So that -- I think that's informative. Obviously, we keep the Fed and all of our regulators up to speed any particular activity. This is clearly one that we've been discussing with them since at least since the early part of this year if not before that. And we've gone through a definitive agreement. We feel confident that of the value here. We feel confident that we can close in the fourth quarter. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then just to go back on the asset servicing. Thanks for the color on the BlackRock transition. Is it, if I heard you correctly, did you say the BlackRock transition was from an asset perspective halfway done? And then if they also read correctly, I think, you've only got $300 billion left to install of the $1.5 trillion to the $1.2 trillion of the new deals over the last 2 quarters is installed? And is that going to be fully in the run rate for 3Q versus \u2026 Eric Aboaf : Yes. You've got that right. You got that right. Brian Bedell : And since you have a tailwind in 3Q from installations other than you have another half of BlackRock to canal? Eric Aboaf : Yes. And this is where if you remember on our last call. There was a lot of questions and interrogations on who is the client will be now I would have tell you that it's Vanguard. We are quite proud of that win. I think it's quite clear in that call that there is always a range of different services that we offer, right, and both in different regions in the U.S. And so the basis point range on pricing if its custody only versus full vertical stake is quite different. And so I think I did that purposely right to give you a sense that in many cases. And I'm not going to comment on a second client now, but in many cases we start with the custody only offering, because sometimes that's the easiest one in which to start with. And then we -- for many clients, we scale that into accounting or administration or middle office or performance and analytics. And so obviously those are discussions we have on with all clients. We won\u2019t comment on Vanguard in particular. But we\u2019re excited to have them. We think they really were impressed with the automation and technology and so forth, but kind of functionality we\u2019ve brought to the custody over the last few years for Beacon efforts and they have they're on a real growth trajectory, which is also constructive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Geoffrey Elliott : Can you give us some thinking on how you look at M&A as part of your strategy more broadly? I guess the regulatory environments moved on a bit over the last few years, which may be makes it a little bit easier than it would have been a few years ago and GE asset management, which was quite smaller now. But I was kind of curious to see how it fits into the strategy and if this could be in the several transactions we might see over the next few years? Jay Hooley : Jeffrey, this is Jay. Let me start that one and maybe invite Ron to jump in as well. We\u2019ve -- I think we\u2019ve said over the last couple periods that the two areas where we thought, we might be all that advance our strategy through an acquisition was both in asset management where we thought there were some select capabilities if we could acquire would enhance our solutions capabilities. And we specifically characterize those as smallish. That\u2019s still an area where if the right thing came along that might be interesting. And the second area with this area that is really represented by Charles River, which is catapulting into the front office, which we\u2019ve all, we\u2019ve had a desire to do because we think that\u2019s where this business is going. And we made a big move into the front office. And so I wouldn\u2019t see other than maybe some small stuff or I\u2019ll turn it over to Ron because, what even with the rumors of State Street and Charles River coming together, you have a lot of other front office providers that are looking to engage with an interface with us. Not necessarily that we would need to acquire but we would integrate to create more functionality in the front office. So I wouldn\u2019t see anything more big on the front office, maybe some smaller capabilities and probably more likely partnerships. Ron O'Hanley: Yes, Geoffrey. What I would add to Jay\u2019s comments is that from where we sit now, we don\u2019t need to do any M&A. And as we\u2019ve, I think, consistently said we\u2019ve got a business strategy, real growth focus in both the data analytics part of asset servicing as well as an asset management. And I think what you\u2019re seeing here is relatively focused -- in both cases relatively focused acquisitions to basically accelerate a strategy that we\u2019d already talked about. Jay\u2019s last comment there about the platform that we\u2019re creating is very important, because -- and I said it a couple times on this call. Our overall strategy even before we started talking to Charles River, has been about data and about this idea that information and information delivered in an inappropriate way and in an unusual way is the most powerful tool we can provide to the market. And as we build out this platform, which Charles River as a part where it goes way beyond Charles River, firstly, it's enabling clients, enabling us to bring lots of solutions to clients including their own solutions or including the solutions of third parties. And as we rollout more of this platform in perfective, it will be very easy for us to have a conversation with the provider like interest in us. And we don't need to buy it. They can come on the platform, we have to look at the pricing of all that. But it's a platform itself that provides the ability to bring all these things together rather than us having to acquire things to bring it together. Geoffrey Elliott : Thank you. And then maybe just to follow up. You mentioned Charles River is going to stay as a separate entity. Who is going to be running that business? Eric Aboaf : Yes, we will install a Chief Executive into that business somebody who is deeply experienced and running the software companies, the founder, will stay on in a consulting role to help us do the transition given he's got a keen interest in making sure this is successful. Geoffrey Elliott : And you mentioned making keen interest on the part of I guess the fellows are making sure it successful. Is there any kind of announce or anything like that? Could it -- it kind of looks like a cash deal? And I guess what is that kind of tied to each of the fellows to the success of this given they're not getting State Street stocks are not going to participate in the hopeful upside of the shift. Eric Aboaf : Let me separate the founder, who has an interest because he's built this company over 30 years. He feels good about State Street and feels good about State Streets being able to take this to the next level and he's obviously got an interest in that? It's not a financial interest, an emotional interest in it. But as you expect, we have spent a fair amount of time with the team and have put in the appropriate retention schemes to make sure that the core asset that we're buying, which is really intellects embedded and the engineers and the software designers are -- we think they're going to embrace State Street as a theme because we're going to invest in this business. This is about taking it to the next level. Ron, would you add to that? Ron O'Hanley: Yes, what I would have add to that is that the founders here own virtually all the equity. There is very little that he doesn't own. So the ongoing retention here and the work with the team that Jay just described is there is a group of very high performing people are excited about them, they're great engineers. We have worked out a compensation plan that we think will be very attractive to them. And they like everybody else at State Street will share in their success. Eric Aboaf : I think that probably that just one more point, Jeffrey. I mean this is a growth opportunity. I think you see it, hopefully you see it, they'll see it. I think growth in itself is exciting theme for the team at Charles River. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe to talk a little bit about 2019 impact, so maybe before we contemplate synergies if I kind of think about the before gone buyback the issuance, I guess the implied net income you expect for 2018 assume some growth. I guess putting that all together again about 3% EPS or earnings dilution. Is that a fair way to think about the numbers? Or is there anything and obviously building in the amortization in that number? Is that the right way to think about it? And if so, are you expecting to get any synergies in 18 to add to that? Eric Aboaf : Tim, it\u2019s Eric. I think it\u2019s early days on this question. And you\u2019re -- you've just started the modeling, I think, in probably in 2, 3 hours. And you're asking this question. I think you\u2019re approaching it correctly, right. You\u2019re kind of going out. What\u2019s the earnings stream you're going to take the 2017 operating earnings? You got to adjust for some of the 606 adoptions, so you got to get that into the mix, you got to adjust for taxes and then you\u2019ve got to build a growth rate on that. So and I think you, as I covered on one of the earlier questions, there\u2019s some revenues that starts to come in but it tends to ramp up overtime expenses some in year one, I think real nice amount in year 2. So I think you\u2019ve got the pieces right. I think what I would prefer to do just to try to be more helpful is when we get to our October call for third quarter, we can give you a good indication of select quarter EPS or I guess, or kind of earnings contribution from this because by then we\u2019ll have completed the deal. We\u2019ll know the exact timing. We\u2019ll have concluded on all the financials. And then I think we\u2019ll have in a good basis either a back call or the January call. It's something that's give you some ranges for '19. So I think, I\u2019d rather take it in steps, but I think you\u2019ve got some of the components, right. And we\u2019re certainly happy to iterate with you on that basis. Jim Mitchell : And then I think about compensation expense getting to the quarter was down quite a bit ex the charge. Is that a good run rate or was there some true up there for you mentioned incentive comp that we shouldn\u2019t annualize that kind of number that we had saw this quarter? Eric Aboaf : Yes. It\u2019s a clear 2 part answer to that. I think on compensation expenses specifically, we did it just downward a bit for performance related incentives. We feel like we need to deliver on the financial commitments we have. We're I think ahead on Beacon and ahead on NII. And I think we\u2019re conscious of the revenue environment and see operating leverage was neutral in the first quarter bit negative in this quarter. And so we obviously match incentive with results. We think that\u2019s the way to run a company. And so there is a bit of an effect there. I think the best way to give you some indication of expenses is given we\u2019re here in the middle of the year. This is the natural time for us to think about second half expenses versus first half. I think you could take a look at what we reported in our view is. We -- and I think, I said it, we intend to keep second half expenses at about the level first half. You got to just out that that first quarter bump that you get. But that to us is the right level of expenses, but we got to be careful. We don\u2019t know markets are going to go up or down. We don't know what kind of macroeconomic environment that we're likely to operate in. And so we think it's best to be prudent on expenses. Jim Mitchell : Okay. But should we exclude the $77 million in that comparison as well? Eric Aboaf : For the repositioning charge? Jim Mitchell : Right. Eric Aboaf : Yes. We think about that as a specific item. That address some delayering that we feel was -- is important and real valuable to do as we transition into a more global and functionalized operating model, yes. Jim Mitchell : Okay. So you adjust that out. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsey Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Ms. Graseck, your line is open. Betsey Graseck : Yes, thanks. Two questions. One question I'm getting from folks this morning is the build worse by. And I know you decided on buy, but maybe you can give us a sense as to why that made sense versus building something else like this on your own? Ron O'Hanley: Betsey, it's Ron. I would say that we're doing both. We've built out a fair amount over the last several years, built out or brought out actually if I think about it. Lots of what we've done in Data GX. Lots of the markets platform that we built FX Connect, Fund Connect, Currenex which will all be integrated in this platform I've described. It really came down to a decision that we see so much activity here so much pull clients. And as we got to know Charles River through the work that SSGA was doing was that we felt that this would really accelerate us to market and enable us to occupy just more of the space quicker than we couldn't on our own. So it was the classic build versus buying. It was really about timing. Eric Aboaf : And Betsey, part of the answer is the capabilities the software and the products and services, but the other part is excess to 300 clients that are kind of in our sweet spot from a standpoint of asset managers, asset owners. In an addition we pick up access to this wealth advisor segment, which is a new segment for us and it's kind of exciting. Betsey Graseck : Okay. Got it. And then the follow-up question was just on the synergies on Page 8, a couple of them are related to streamlining and cash at synergies out of State Street's middle and back office. So maybe you could help me understand how that works because you're buying someone who is more of a front office operator. So just want to understand that. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Betsey, it's Eric. Let me describe those on Page 8 on the right side there is a series of different synergies. I think at the bottom of the page, right, one of them is just implementing Charles River within SSGA our own asset management is factored in something that we've been considering for over 2 years now. So if you could imagine we actually did product and functionality diligence right with our CIO and PM teams long before we even consider this as an acquisition. So and if you think about SSGA we got $1.3 billion expense base in SSGA. If you look at just technology narrowly defined, it's $100 million. And so we're looking at some consolidation benefits from simplifying that what we have built, which is decent overtime, but not at the level of what we have here, so that's kind of one example. I think when you get to the operational efficiencies at the top, remember, and the systems, remember, we have a set of middle office systems today because we are in the middle office business, and so does Charles River. If you remember the slides that Jay showed earlier on, we\u2019re both in that middle office area. For example, we both have a compliance system that helps with compliance processing. For the -- for asset managers, they have one we have one, a natural ones retired turns out that\u2019s an expensive system to run and to operate. And so just something like that is worth in the $15 million range. So it\u2019s those kinds of overlaps that exist. And then the last is, obviously, as we work on this middle office area, which is full of reconciliations and data flows in comparison as soon as we begin to offer a service that streamline some of that, there\u2019s real costs to take out. And so we\u2019re quite confident on the expense synergies there off of a relatively large base of what we do. And this is -- and it\u2019s also an area we have a lot of experience extracting efficiencies off of. Betsey Graseck : Okay. And the data analytics piece, I know you have been building out your data analyst front end platform. I think you showcase some of that several years back at an Investor Day here in New York. So just wanted to understand if the acquisition means that those efforts then go away or just get layered on to CRD because you don\u2019t need to do that anymore? Is it -- in other words is it, is the acquisition a replacement of your internal efforts for building up data analytics platform or is it adjacent to? Ron O'Hanley: Betsy, this is Ron, I\u2019ll take that. I think it\u2019s a little bit of both in the sense that there\u2019s some capabilities that Charles River brings that are additive. There are some capabilities that didn\u2019t have that with some what we have -- it just rounds out the sweet. And then there are some things that are by the dense back to work together. We can actually build something together that we probably couldn\u2019t build, either one of us could have built on our own. So if you think about going back to Eric\u2019s point on where the front office leads, and so the middle office would be a post trade workflow management. That\u2019s probably a space where Charles River has some tools in it, but now that they\u2019re exposed to our very large middle office business. We can build up even a better tool than they have had or include that matter than anybody else has. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : A couple of questions for you folks. How is Data GX service price buying folks today when you pitch it to your clients? Jay Hooley : I would say it's -- Vivek, this is Jay. Subscription base as a recurring fee associated with add-ons, if you add custodians or expand the base, and then in addition, once you get Data GX, which is the data aggregation layer. And then on top of that, we have a number of analytic platforms that actually apply some analytics to the aggregated data and that has a separate revenue stream, which is all subscription based. All of this is recurring based on usage. Vivek Juneja : So not tied to the rest of the middle back office contracts that you may have? Jay Hooley : Not at all. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Ron, a question for you. I just heard you saying or maybe it was Eric, that for SSGA, your tech spending was $100 million and you're going to say $10 million hereby using CRD. So does this -- are you saying that this would cut front office costs for your clients by about 10%? Is that the right extrapolation? Eric Aboaf : Vivek, it's Eric. I think every client will be different. We've been able to kind of interrogate our own base of expenses. You actually have to when you do the math even on SSGA of $1.3 billion our expense base. There is technology base for $100 million. There is also an operations expense base that's associated with that. And I was trying to just focus on the system just to kind of compartmentalize this and give us an estimate. But I think this could be representative of the value. And obviously, we think a value that way. We think that CEOs and CIOs are going to think about value that way. But remember this is partly an efficiency play for institutions and asset managers because they're all under examination on those fees for in the active space. But it's as much a functionality and what are the benefits and do I get the functionality that I need. And so, our view as we've got a premier property here that can help do both. And that's what makes an attractive for the range of constituents you have. And at least as an example, we think this is in the range of what someone could expect but it would depend on what they have, they build it internally, how fragmented, how many little providers do they have. And so there is probably a range around that. Jay Hooley : And Vivek, I would just add, this is Jay, that, I do think that the cost and the efficiency is important, but if you think about our own synergy model, it's only a third of what the value is. And I think of this as giving states to access to the front office platform world. And the network effect that can be created by having a Charles River through 300 client connected to State Street's liquidity and trading engines. I think it's a pretty powerful concept. And that's just the start, that doesn't include the other relationships and partnerships that will wire into this as Ron referenced earlier. Vivek Juneja : And as a lead time for getting these kinds of follow ups, getting CRD contracts similar to what you have to go through on the rest of your business which can be multi-year process? Jay Hooley : Yes, let me take that. I think it depends is the answer Vivek, this is Jay. CRD is the system that has multiple components. And so when you changing out a software platform that's a careful exercise that has some lead time to it. And I would say that the short to long lead time will be defined by the complexity of the environment. SSGA is a reasonably complex environment both globally across asset classes. And I'd say once that gets lined up that's probably 1 year, 1.5 year kind of implementation cycle with deliveries along the way. It doesn't all the way and it happened in the final day. Vivek Juneja : I guess I was trying to think off, Jay, the whole idea of pitching and winning business, which I know for traditional middle and back office as a multi-year. So that's what I was trying to get a sense of CRD so much similar. Ron O'Hanley: Yes. This is Ron, Vivek. I think that, again, it will be quite client-specific, but if there\u2019s a situation where we're already doing a lot of transformation work with a client and working with them, for example, in moving their middle office, you could see this is being a pretty rapid add-on to that because a lot of the things that you do or if we already have the middle office, a lot of the things that would be required to plug that in, we\u2019d have already done. So I think, if you\u2019re asking one, will the pipeline build fairly quickly? Yes, probably will although to be clear what we're focused on how in the first few months after the close. We want to make sure that they\u2019re continuing to serve their existing clients very well. And then we\u2019ll add to the pipeline has it makes sense. Vivek Juneja : Yes, because I noticed, your compound annual growth is almost 7% to 14%. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of over what period should we expect that to happen? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think certainly over the 3-year time period for that, we have to, we gave you a CAGR on that, right. So the first year it'll be closer to the seven and the year, a little higher. But we think of this as mid-teens growing stream. At least as we are broaden them into our clients whether it\u2019s our U.S. clients, and I showed you the overlap data, which I think is quite striking. We can bring them into half of our top-tier clients where they\u2019ve not been able to get in the door where we know the CEOs and CIOs and then internationally. So it\u2019ll build overtime and our view is it provides a nice stream. But as Ron said, we got to be careful, right. We got a first really invest in current clients, serving them as well and building this business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just one quick question first maybe, I'll take you back to what Vivek just asked. How long one from integration, we will actually go out to clients and say this is our end-to-end solution that we have for you. May I know how you want have deal closed in the fourth quarter, but when can you actually bring that solution to clients? Like what quarter, what year? Jay Hooley : Brian, I would say, this is Jay. I would say we\u2019re working on this already. I think we said it a few times but the fact that SSGA is two years into -- SSGA, obviously, a middle and back office client of State Street and has been working on this for a year, has given us a chance to really understand the connect points and understand the things that can be delivered in a relatively short period of time and those things that will happen overtime. So I think it will evolve. But probably pretty quickly, we\u2019ll be able to show some linkages to the existing Charles River client base and to the State Street client base, which will show some value and it will grow over time. And I think, if you think about not only wiring this together from a State Street's standpoint, but wiring additional capabilities from other firms into this, it\u2019ll just continue to grow. Unidentified Company Representative : Yes, and what I would add to that is, I think the important thing to know about this client base and this segment is that, even those firms that have are starting to outsource the middle office, they haven\u2019t, most actually haven\u2019t put in an integrated solution into their front-office. So this isn't about necessarily displacing somebody else. It's often times what we're displacing is proprietary systems or spread sheets that have been built up overtime. And as we're, given again that we're working with them in the middle office, it's a pretty easy conversation to say here what's contributing to the complexity of your middle office. It has to do with your front-office and what's help you figure this out. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Great. And then maybe just one quick on the financials from the deal, Eric, you mentioned that the CET1 dilution was 50 basis points. But can you help us break that down. I don't know if I recall what the total intangibles were from a deal. I don't know if there would be any RWA impacts from the deal? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, it's Eric. I think the easiest way to think about this is $2.6 billion of goodwill and intangibles, right, and obviously all those are deducted from capital and a regulatory reporting. And so we've developed a fully kind of ratio neutral financing of equity on the other side. So that those -- that could go on intangibles. So if -- Brian, if everything was contemporaneously -- it'd be neutral in Tier 1 capital and leverage capital basis and that would be that deterioration on the set 1 ratio. I think the next part of that is overtime, there is a mix of goodwill and intangibles. The intangibles come through expense base unless the deduction is lower. And then if you can just model it out based on, I think, we've given the intangible split is roughly 800 to 900 over the 10 years. And I think you can just work through on a model how that plays out. And so that will come through our expense base, but the deduction from capital will come out. And that will play through kind of a classic multi-year model, but we can surely help you with offline. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : I apologize if you've asked this question I jumped on late. I understand that you're going to keep Charles River separate, as a separate entity and I'm assuming they're not a bank holding company or any do not have a banking license. Are there any regulatory issues that you have to address with them as you integrate them as part of your bank holding company? Any added costs or anything like that because they're not regulated by the bank regulators today? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it's Eric. Within the financial guidance that we've given you here on revenues or cost to deliver the revenue and the expenses, we've actually factored in what you've usually have to do to take a private company and put it into a public setting. So I think there is a usual work we have to do on the accounting and auditing and financial reporting side for the various implementations that we have. And then we got the same thing on the more bank regulatory side, clearly, it has grown from safety and soundness standpoint and data security and so forth at the level that you'd expect a bank of our size and scope to have until we get back to that. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then the second, I know you've given us some good data about the revenue synergies on Slide 8. And the internal rate of return that you guys calculated and the expectation that this was accretive. With a run rate today of your total revenues of about $12 billion, it seems like, and this happens in other acquisitions for your company and others that these benefits are hard for investors to kind of extract down 2, 3 years down the road to see if it\u2019s really working. Are there any objective measures that you can share with us that we should look at that we can really see that? Yes, this deal was a great deal or no it\u2019s not coming as expected. Aside from what you\u2019ve given us in this slide, since again, they can blended into your regular numbers? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think, Gerard, we\u2019ll be doing exactly you\u2019d like to see, right. Because we need to make sure that we extract the value from this acquisition and it\u2019s not just combined with other activities. Now, like you say, it\u2019s not a perfect science to do that. But our perspective as each one of these, because there are 5 buckets we\u2019ve given you, they\u2019re actually dozen buckets behind that, I think that we'd like to track. But take them by example, the liquidity services that we put against the platform. That comes through and defined revenue streams against defined clients and through specific systems that we need to track, actually just book it on the GL in the right way and that should be something that we can trace back, we need to trace it back just for our own data lineage standpoint. And so that\u2019s the kind of thing we can share. I think wealth management is compartment. I think if you go back to the top of the list, we talked about converting additional clients from the on-premises to cloud application that we will be able to find clients, client counts, what were they, what are they now, what\u2019s under implementation, so with some view of the trajectory. So we\u2019ll do everything we can. We\u2019ll be doing it, anyway, internally, right. And we\u2019ll certainly find ways to share that with you on some kind of regular basis to bring it together. I think if you step back though, at the end of the day, I think we've given guidance as to what we think our underlying growth rate is before the acquisition. We did that in January. And that gave you some sense for how we think of the toxicity and accounting and management businesses, end markets businesses to grow. And our perspective is this can add percentage point on top of that. But we\u2019ll do everything we can to show you with the transparency that\u2019s possible whether we\u2019re achieving it or how we end up at what pace. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jeff Harte with Sandler O'Neill. Jeffery Harte : Good morning, guys. Most things have been covered, but just a couple. Can you talk a little bit about the revenue terms in the front office space now? I mean, is this potentially big offering, but I\u2019m kind of wondering how that compares to your more traditional businesses were from the outside. We kind of still calculate the fees as a percent of assets under custody continuing to decline? Eric Aboaf : I\u2019ll start Jeff and maybe ask Ron to weight in. I think that, if I compare the back, middle and front, I would say the back office pretty mature as far as the set of services and the set of competitors. The middle office, maybe, 40% of that outsourced today. There\u2019s more to go. I\u2019d say the front office is even more immature. And that, and Ron referenced this earlier the front offices are up and running, but the pressure that people have feeling to consolidate systems get that data replaced, all tier proprietary systems caused us need to say the front office is probably has the most explosive growth opportunity in it. We size the market at a billion but I would say from a standpoint of change, churn and growth, the front office has the most attractive growth of those three segments. Bur Ron, what would you think? Ron O'Hanley: I'd agree with that Jay. And Jeff, what I would add is that, if you think about it, many of the kinds of tools and capabilities that we're now able to offer in the data space. They just weren't able to be offered 5, 10 years ago in terms of particularly some of the Big Data analytics and the unstructured data analytics kinds of tools. So you're creating basically -- it's a relatively new market with new offerings. And as Jay noted, in many cases you're taking things that either weren't being done or were being done in a fairly primitive way in the front office and now putting it together in a much more industrial strength kind of data analytics and platform package. Jeffery Harte : Okay. And in client retentions, can you talk bit about, a) how important it is and b) the financial impacts? I mean our retention packages and things like that included in $200 million of acquisition and restructuring costs? Eric Aboaf : Yes, it's Eric. Yes, absolutely. There is about $50 million that we put aside for that kind of that the talent that we're bringing on. And we're we'd like to expand on that talent actually overtime because that's what's going to drive additional growth in the business. So that's the important part of the $200 million that we summarized there. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Eric Aboaf : Thanks, Lisa, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We look forward to providing you an update in October after the third quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks Ilene, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen, we announced our third quarter financial results this morning. Our third quarter and year-to-date results reflect solid performance across our businesses as we continue to win new business and invest in the future, while reducing legacy costs as we advance our digital transformation. Despite a higher than average share count, third quarter earnings included substantial EPS growth and increased return on equity compared to 3Q 2017. Assets under custody and administration rose to record levels of $34 trillion, a 6% increase year-on-year driven by strength in equity markets and new business wins. We achieve new asset servicing mandates of approximately $300 billion during the quarter, driven by two substantial wins of approximately $90 billion each from the large European client and a top insurance and investment management company. Importantly, year-to-date we've now seen a number of sizable new client business wins, totaling $1.8 trillion and our new business pipeline opportunities remain robust across the franchise, giving us continued confidence about the differentiation in the marketplace from the service and solutions standpoint. Assets under management at State Street Global Advisors were at record levels of $2.8 trillion at the end of the third quarter, up 5% year-on-year and 3% sequentially, reflecting strength in equity markets and ETF inflows driven by the continued success of our low cost product launch late last year and institutional inflows. These positive growth trends within our core franchise were partially offset by market and industry headwinds, leading to overall fee revenue increasing only 2% year-over-year. I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive costs out of our core business and adapt quickly to the revenue environment we experienced this quarter. We actively brought down expenses for two successive quarters. Beacon continues to deliver significant savings and we have embarked on new productivity initiatives to achieve greater standardization and globalization of our operations and services. These levers equip us to achieve strong expense control as evidenced by the year-to-date increase in our pre-tax margins while continuing to invest for the future. More importantly, these initiatives enable us to create new data-oriented services and will provide the foundation for the integration of Charles River into the industry's first ever front to back office asset servicing platform from a single provider. Let me take a moment to update you on Charles River Development. As you know the acquisition closed October 1, integration is well underway and initial client reaction has been overwhelmingly positive. Charles River is already creating opportunities among new and existing clients. We have our management team in place and are establishing a client advisory board anchored by OMERS. The Ontario Pension Fund, which is a broad based user of Charles River dating back 11 years. We're encouraged by the early reaction to the acquisition and are confident that will enable us to deepen and grow our client base, while delivering positive results for our shareholders. With that let me turn the call over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Jay and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 4, where you will find our quarterly results as well as a few notable items from prior quarters. As a reminder, 2Q 2018 include a repositioning charge of $77 million and 3Q 2017 included $26 million gain related to the sale of an equity trading platform, as well as 33 million in restructuring costs. I'll also remind you that 3Q 2018 results include the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. This increased both fee and total expense by $70 million year-over-year but is EBIT neutral. Now let me move to Slide 5, where I will review the quarterly results as well as the year-to-date highlights. Third quarter 2018 EPS increased to a $1.87, up 13% relative to a year ago. ROE was 14%, up a full percentage point and pre-tax margin increased half a point as compared to prior year. 3Q 2018 results reflect a disappointing fee revenue environment, largely offset by strength in net interest income and tighter expense control. We achieved positive operating leverage of 80 basis points compared to 3Q 2017. Fee operating leverage, however was negatively impacted by lower than expected fee revenue, which I will touch on shortly. Given the soft fee revenue environment, we intervened on expenses, excluding the impact from revenue recognition and the prior year restructuring charge, we held expense growth to just 1% as compared to last year. Sequentially, we actively flex expenses downwards. Last quarter I told you we would keep second half expenses flat to first half. In 3Q we did just that. Expense control is a key management priority as we navigate the quarterly revenue environment. We are carefully investing in product differentiation that continues to drive new business wins while reducing legacy costs. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered solid results. EPS increased 24% and ROE increased approximately two percentage points. We achieved positive operating leverage of 2.3 percentage points supported by positive momentum in NII and 4% year-to-date servicing fee growth. Pre-tax margin increased approximately 1.5 percentage points, further demonstrating our focus on managing expenses. Now, let me turn to Slide 6 to review AUCA and AUM performance, which increase on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. AUCA increased 6% from 3Q 2017 to 34 trillion. Growth was primarily driven by U.S. market appreciation and several large client installations, partially offset by the previously announced BlackRock transition. In Global Advisors or asset management business, AUM increased 5% from 3Q 2017, driven by strength in U.S. equity markets and new business from ETF mandate's, only partially offset by lower net flows within the institutional and cash segments. Please turn to Slide 7 where I will review 3Q 2018 fee revenue as compared to 3Q 2017. Total fee revenue increased 2%, reflecting higher equity markets and trading activity, as well as the benefit related to revenue recognition. Servicing fee revenue was lower compared to 3Q 2017, as well as compared to 2Q 2018, although it was up 4% on a year-to-date basis. 3Q results reflect the previously announced BlackRock transition, which was worth an additional 20 million this quarter, as well as challenging industry conditions. Most important global economic uncertainty has driven investors to the sidelines, causing significant outflows and lower activity across the bulk of the asset management industry. We have also seen some fee pressure and two to three quarters of fund outflows in both the U.S. and Europe, which together creates a downdraft on the industry servicing fees. In emerging markets which typically represent higher per dollar servicing fees were negative both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. That said, net new business was strong again this quarter and year-to-date servicing fees are up 4% as I mentioned. Now, let me briefly touch on the other fee revenue lines related to 3Q 2017. Management fees increased 13% benefiting from global equity markets, as well as $50 million related to the new revenue recognition standard. Trading services revenues increased 11%, primarily due to higher FX client volumes. Securities finance fees decreased driven by some balance sheet optimization that is now complete. This provides a base of for which to grow these revenues in line with our balance sheet expansion as I've previously mentioned. Processing fees decreased from 3Q 2017, reflecting a prior year gain partially offset by higher software fees. Moving to Slide 8, NII was up 11% and NIM increased 13 basis points on a fully tax equivalent basis relative to 3Q 2017. NII benefited from higher U.S. interest rates and continued discipline liability pricing, partially offset by continuing mix shift towards HQLA securities in the investment portfolio. NIM increased due to higher NII and a smaller interest earning base due to deposit volume volatility. Deposit betas for the U.S. interest-bearing accounts were relatively unchanged from last quarter, though we expect betas to continue to edge higher in future quarters in line with industry trends. Now, I will turn to Slide 9 to highlight our intense focus on expense discipline, which continued into the third quarter. 3Q 2018 expenses were well controlled relative to 3Q 2017 increasing 3%. Excluding approximately 70 million associated with revenue recognition and a prior year restructuring cost, expenses were up less than 1% from a year ago quarter as we continue to actively manage the cost base. The 1% increase in expenses was due to investments in costs for new business, as well as higher trading volumes, partially offset by Beacon phase. Sequentially, expenses decreased 4% from 2Q, which included the second quarter $7 million repositioning charge. Excluding the charge, expenses were flat, further demonstrating our ability to flex the cost base to the current revenue environment. As I mentioned, this is a second quarter in a row of sequential underlying expense reduction. During 2Q 2018, we reduced incentive compensation. This quarter we reduced vendor and discretionary spend. Quickly, from a line item perspective and relative to 3Q 2017, compensation and employee benefits increased just 1%, reflecting cost for our new business and annual merit increases, partially offset by Beacon savings and new contractor, vendor initiatives, information systems increased, reflecting Beacon-related investments as well as additional investments to support new business growth. Transaction processing cost increased due to the impact of the new revenue recognition standard, offset by sub-custodian savings this quarter. Occupancy costs were down as a result of the continued progress in optimizing our global footprint. And excluding the $38 million impact of revenue recognition, other expenses decreased 3%, reflecting lower discretionary spent such as travel expenses and Beacon-related savings. Turning to Slide 10, let me briefly highlight what actions we have successfully taken to manage expenses relative to the revenue landscape over the last several quarters. On the top of the slide you can see that we achieved $65 million in net Beacon sales this quarter, through our efforts to optimize the core servicing business, transform our IT infrastructure and gain efficiencies within the corporate functions and SSGA. Notably, we are on track to complete Beacon by early 2019, significantly ahead of our original year-end 2020 target. We continue to invest towards a highly digitized environment, including robotics and machine learning, which are driving innovation and cost savings for us and our clients. In addition, as you can see in the bottom panel, we just rolled out a series of new expense initiatives in light of current industry conditions that are affecting quarterly revenues. These total $40 million just this quarter. And additional actions are planned in the fourth quarter. Moving to Slide 11, let me touch on our balance sheet. The size of our investment portfolio remained flat sequentially and well positioned given the rate environment. Our capital ratios increased measurably from 2Q 2018, as a result of our pre-funding related to the Charles River acquisition which we completed on October 1, as well as earnings retention. As a reminder, in late July we issued approximate $1.1 billion of common stock and in September successfully issued $500 million of preferred stock, while temporarily suspending buyback. We fully intend to resume our common stock repurchases in 1Q 2019 and expect to return $600 million to shareholders through 2Q 2019. We also completed the necessary adjustments for our management processes and believe that we are well prepared for CCAR 2019. Moving to Slide 12, let me summarize. Our 3Q 2018 results reflect a continued fund focused on managing expenses in response to the current quarterly revenue environment. The 11% increase in net interest income compared to 3Q 2017 offset in-part the softness in servicing fee revenues I described. Notably, 3Q 2018 pre-tax margin increased to 29.4%, supported by the strength in NII and disciplined expense management. Year-to-date results also reflect solid progress from the 2017 period. We announced new business wins of $1.8 trillion of custodial assets. EPS increased 24% and ROE improved buy almost 2 percentage points or 13.8%. NII increased 17%, reflecting higher U.S. interest rates and our success in managing liability pricing. Calibrating expenses, the revenue generated positive operating leverage of 2.3 percentage points. Let me briefly touch on our 4Q 2018 outlook, which currently excludes the recently completed Charles River acquisition. We expect 4Q 2018 servicing fee revenue to be flattish to 3Q assuming continuing industry conditions and stable market levels. We expect continued sequential NII growth though this always depends on market rates and betas. We expect total expenses only slightly above 3Q levels, but consistent with our expectations to keep second half of 2018 expenses flat to first half excluding the seasonal deferred incentive ramp and repositioning as we actively manage expenses relative to the revenue landscape. As I said these estimates do not yet include acquisition of Charles River that we completed earlier this month. So let me give you some color on that, before I turn the call back to Jay. Although it is early days we're very excited about the opportunities to deliver to our clients the first-ever front-to-back office asset servicing solutions on a single provider. During fourth quarter, we will be giving guidance on revenues and expenses from the Charles River acquisition at an upcoming conference. In 2019, we look forward to providing regular updates to investors and how we are progressing against the revenue and expense synergies that we can communicated on the July earnings call. Now let me hand the call back to Jay. Jay Hooley : Thanks Eric. And Laura we're now - if you would open-up the call to questions we are available. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : A couple of quick ones on the securities portfolio I see, A) the duration extends a little bit I think; B) the yield on the securities book was flat, and C) it now has $1 billion unrealized loss position which I think it's just expansion of the mortgage book but could you mind commenting on those three things? Eric Aboaf : Maybe in reverse order, the OCI position is just one that moves in firstly with rates and so as we have seen the upward rate environment that comes through as a mark on the balance sheet. I think it's within good set of balance of that's - that was to be expected. In terms of the investment portfolio, I think as we described in first quarter and second quarter we continue to remix that portfolio. We have been gently shifting out of credit and into sort of more classic HQLA securities. Though some movements of that this quarter between ABS and Muni's and so forth which resulted in relatively flat yield. The big piece that you have to remember is that we've added and continued to add international foreign debt securities, right German bonds and British gills and that kind of high-grade sovereign. As we do that we do less of the FX swaps back to the U.S. And so our FX swap cost actually came down by nearly $35 million this quarter. And so what you actually see is you see relatively stable yields in the portfolio in aggregate. But if you look down on the interest-bearing liability line for non-U.S. domicile deposits, you see reduced interest expense because we have less of that FX swaps. So just keep in mind that that the FX played through both on the investment portfolios, on the asset side and the liability side as yet read through. Glenn Schorr : And then there's the further migration at of non-U.S. deposits and it looks like U.S. deposits are up. It also, there is a big drop in the yield paid in the non-U.S. deposits. So is that you purposely migrating those deposits via pricing? Eric Aboaf : No. This has less to do with rate than just the movement of the domicile from deposits. If you remember, we like many banks had had deposits in the Cayman branches and other, what I'll call offshore but U.S. related areas. Those were always, those were typically U.S. dollar deposits but were classified by the regulatory reporting standards as non U.S. domiciled. So we effectively did is we've closed down that program, it's no longer necessary. It's one of those legacy programs that we and other banks have had. So what's happened is the U.S. deposits which are paid, U.S. interest rates which tend to be higher than foreign deposits interest rates have actually moved out of the non-U.S. mining so the U.S. line which is what brings the non-U.S. line down sequentially and then it just blends into U.S. line. At this point we have made I think two steps of a change of about I want to say almost $20 billion that we have moved. It's now - those moves are completed. And so on a go-forward basis the account should be a little cleaner for you to read through. Operator : Our next question is from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : First question just wanted to follow up Eric on the fourth quarter indication on servicing fees. You had indicated that you expected them to be flat with this third quarter. So I guess the question is, is that based upon the current quarter-to-date action that we see in some of the markets because there is some been some continued EM weakness and I know that's a headwind for you. So does it consider those dynamics? And do you just think that it will be offset by improved volume trends? Or can you give us a little bit more there please? Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think when you look quarter-to-quarter it's always - it's a set of small moves and rounding. So we continue to see negative flows in all the public data, whether it's EM but also in the other international markets which will be a bit of a headwind. We've got nearly all of the BlackRock transaction out. We've got I said 10 in the 1Q to 2Q 2020 from 2Q to 3Q. We got $5 more, so that will get to a $35 million run rate so that's nearly finished up. And then - there\u2019s some installations coming through as the pipeline plays out. And then the open question will be what happens to market levels because you know how that plays through our fee structure. So we think it's going to be flattish. I think there is - it's rough estimate for now and kind of an assemblage of those - the composites of those move. Brennan Hawken : So it does consider some of that weakness thank you for clarifying that. Second question being, you previously had indicated an expectation of the fee operating leverage, I want to say that the bottom end of the range was positive 75 bps for the full year. I don't think you included those comments in your prepared remarks. Is there an update to that outlook? How should we think about that? I'm guessing it would be pretty hard to reach that kind of fee operating leverage for the full year, given the first nine months trend? Eric Aboaf : Yes Brendan, it's Eric. And I think you've called it right. I gave outlook here. I needed to give outlook either on the flip quarter basis or on a full year basis. And obviously, you guys can model out the other piece either way. But I'd just do it for our fourth quarter, just to give you the direct information. I think if you put together the composites of 1Q plus 2Q plus 3Q, yet in my fourth quarter you'll see that we have good line of sight to many of the targets that we gave in January, but I think fee operating leverage, as you described, will - it's not going to be one of them on a full year basis. That said, we are very focused on controlling what we can control and you've seen us, I think, intervene pretty significantly on expenses and we'll continue to do that as we navigate through the quarterly revenue environment. And that's probably an area, expenses in particular, where I think we will have outperformed our intentions for the year. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Eric, can you talk a little bit about - you mentioned that in second quarter you had trimmed back on the incentive comp and then this quarter you made the additional changes to $40 million. I guess, how do we - can you help us understand, given the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook, how do we understand where you are in terms of incentive comp overall? Like, is it truing up relative to where the revenues have come from through, part of your fourth quarter outlook for flat expenses? How do you just generally think about, say, you've done in the past, or it's trued up at the end of the year for disappointing revenue trajectory? So just maybe you can hover through some of the moving pieces of how you expect that flat expenses in the fourth to be coming from? Eric Aboaf : So Ken, let me first describe how we and I think other banks address incentive compensation. Right? At the beginning of the year, we have estimates of where we're going to deliver in terms of revenues and expenses and other NII and total earnings and EPS. As we move through the year, right, we check to see how we are trending against those expectations. First quarter was a good quarter, generally, and there was no need to make any adjustments. And second quarter, right, as we saw that step down around flows and those industry conditions that have started to permeate through the P&L, we came to the clear realization that we weren't going to deliver at least for the first half year. And as a result, we did a year-to-date catch up on incentive compensation. And that was where $40 million, $45 million in terms of reduction in that quarter. This quarter, we've kind of kept that at the adjusted pace. So - but obviously, without the catch up, so the quarters are lumpy. And then in fourth quarter, we'll assess again where we are. But as I said, I think, we have delivered on a number of our objectives and targets that we set out for ourselves and made public, but not all of them. And every one of those targets count. In terms of line of sight into fourth quarter we - there is kind of a comp benefits and a non-comp and benefits of part two to that. Merits already paid through on comp and benefits. I think incentive compensation we kind of have some line of sight to between this quarter, but we need to kind of see how fourth quarter plays out. As you described headcount is important in particular. You remember, in second quarter we took some decisive actions and drove some management delayering right that was a result of the organizational globalization and streamlining that we took upon ourselves to do potential, and so some of that will start to play out as a benefit into fourth quarter. So that's kind of a number of puts and takes for fourth quarter if we think about the comp and benefits line. And then the non-comp and benefits is every vendor and third party spend and discretionary line. We know how we've done this quarter, we have - we reforecast and think about the actions we have taken or intend to take and that gives us some line of sight which is why we said fourth quarter would be up slightly from third quarter. But we think well controlled and deliver nicely in a year-on-year basis. Ken Usdin : And then second one, just you mention in the slides sec bending business has been changed a little bit due to some of your balance sheet optimization. Can you just talk us through, are you through with that balance sheet optimization? And would you expect sec lending to kind of have formed a base from here? Thanks a lot. Eric Aboaf : Yes we are through with the adjustments we needed to make in the sec lending business. That one includes the Classic Agency lending and Enhanced Custody. There has been a number of regulatory rules including CCAR that affect those businesses. We had a condition upon our - of that - we had the conditional approval under CCAR. We did I think some very good work around the analysis and the reporting and the management of counter parties which did include the securities lending area. We now feel like we're complete on those. We have confidence. We are as a result well prepared for CCAR. And when we think about the work we have done, we actually feel like we have also begun to deploy the kinds of future actions or actions today and actions that we can continue in the future that can give us lift and headroom. And so we have implemented a set of additional diversification from the very largest counterparties, the next group, sometimes its U.S. international, sometimes international to U.S. We have done netting and novations that help compress the book in some ways, so you don't have the large puts and takes, but you've got netted down exposure. And then what we've done as effectively systematize many of those tools because those are kind of action tools and we've systemized those in many cases on a day-by-day and even intraday basis. And that gives us confidence that we've been able to now create headroom of which we can grow sec lending on a go-forward basis. Certainly in line with the balance sheet but our intention is that that is a continued growth area. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the expense opportunities that you see in may be in the next quarter if you can't do it specifically but over the next year or so? And not only your own benefits from Beacon that you have been generating but what do you expect to get from CRD? Jay Hooley : Betsy, this is Jay. Let me start that what Eric would pick up. You mentioned beacon and I think that's a good place to start, because a lot of the expense actions that Eric just reference a few minutes ago are kind of tactical expense actions. I think that for strategically as we have gone through Beacon and its predecessor ITOT the people we go, the better the opportunity looks. We are standardizing activity connecting processes together eliminating human touch we do see reconciliations all of which have multiple benefits. The one you're asking about is the cost benefit. And we'll expire Beacon formerly next year but those opportunities will by no means expire. I mean there are multiyear opportunities to continue to drive greater efficiencies in this core operations around custody accounting globally and you will recall at the back-end of 2017. We reorganize the business so that we're in a better position to take advantage of systematically going at we call it a straight through processing really to reduce the human labor content and the core activities that we conduct. And we've got a long way to go before we get that to a place where we're straight through and it will have huge benefits to clients, it will have huge benefits to the cost line. So there\u2019s plenty to do. Ron O'Hanley: Betsy, this is Ron. Let me just add a little bit to what Jay said. Because I think for all the things that we've accomplished to-date, I would say that there is a second order that we can get out of it and let me be specific here. So we've been on this big push to put in place end-to-end processing and that's been enabled by a lot of the automation and changes we've done in Beacon. But there is more that can be done there. I mean, as we do some we find more. As we've stood up, and strengthen our global hubs in India, Hangzhou and Poland they've matured. And they've gotten to the point where it's less about just taking in bits of work and more about taking in whole processes. So that would be one. The second order and third order out of this is we've talked earlier about the de-layering. I would say that we're going \u2013 that we're moving into the point where we can do major flattening of the organization as you actually move these processes together. And then lastly, much of the Beacon journey and the technology journey has been about standardizing when we can. The historic core of our client base has been large asset managers. And in many cases in the past that has driven us to customization. We've now learned and what we continue to learn how to standardize as much as possible and move less to customize and more to configure and that in itself will provide more opportunities. So we see ongoing opportunities to reduce expenses without actually in fact impairing client service, but at the same time improving client service. Betsy Graseck : And how far away do you think you are from fully digital assets capability? Jay Hooley : Let me take that Betsy because this is a journey and you can think of the glass as half full because there continues to be opportunities literally in every area. As we've globalize the business and think about somewhat Jay described as straight through processing. Those kinds of opportunities exist that are level of say accounting or custody but they also exist deep down - custody, for example, you can break down into bank loan processing, securities processing, derivative processing. And every one of those in our minds we have \u2013 we continue to find more areas as we fully globalize the organization. And so it's hard to say whether we\u2019re in the third inning or the seventh inning. We're Red Sox fans up here so it's a - there's always the temptation to do that. But the truth is there continues to be real substantial opportunities and as we go deeper and deeper and more and more globally through the organization. Operator : Our next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So I was hoping we could peel back the onion a little bit on what's going on in servicing fees and understanding the quarter-to-quarter dynamic is - could be pretty lumpy. But Eric you mentioned fee pressure a bit more specifically I guess in your prepared remarks. So I was wondering whether or not you guys are seeing acceleration in fee pressure within servicing from some of the asset management clients? If so kind of what's changed in the last kind of six months? And then because the active management have seen outflows for a long time so kind of what's driving incremental fee pressure? And more importantly I guess as you think about State Street servicing fees organic growth over the next kind of 12 to 24 months, what should we be thinking about taking to - into account the fee dynamics as well as kind of your comments about the pipeline? Jay Hooley : Alex this is Jay. Let me start and Eric and probably Ron will run away and miss an important question. Now, I think the - at the very broadest level there's derisking, which really begin in the second quarter. Broad-based risking has only continued. And the way that it affects us is we talk about outflows but out - the mutual funds have been outflow - outflowing in the U.S. for a long time I'd say that step down we saw was in Europe where we have a large business mostly in the offshore centers. Last year in first quarter we had very robust inflows that went to neutral and I think that's probably a factor of Brexit and Italy and all the commotion that's going on in Europe. So that was kind of a new factor and we are - because of our success over there probably disproportionately affect I'd say broadly the EM pressure is kind of the second thing that has really put pressure on us. All that combined created lower transaction fees. So it's mostly around the broad-based derisking that has those two or three tributary factors that go with it. And I'd say Europe with the a little bit emphasis. I think the - so that's - none of that\u2019s particularly good news. I would say if there was a silver lining at all is that in news we all see this, our clients are under considerable pressure. And that can play out in couple of ways with us. It puts pressure on our fees that we charge our clients. But in the overall scheme of things our fees aren't going to solve our client issues so relatively deminimis. So it really opens up the opportunity which is why we continue to stress the new business pipeline, the differentiation, the middle-office data GX more recently Charles River. Because our clients are continuing to come to us on an accelerated way to say help us out. Take over the middle-office help us solve the data problem. The response to Charles River was over-the-top. I mean, our clients get what's going on in the need to consolidate front-to-back processing, to extract data. So I would say all of these guys weigh in, but in the broadest context, it's the derisking and all of the things that flow from that. And the reaction from our clients is some pressure but also help us out. Ron O'Hanley: Yes, what I would add to that this is Ron. Just to maybe a little bit more specificity on the flows in Europe. Mutual funds are still quite popular relative to ETFs. And Jay noted that net flows went from positive to basically neutral, but it's worth looking at the underlying component for kind of what was the in versus what was the out. With that derisking the breakout was emerging market as Jay noted and that's just a higher fee per asset for us. So that just hurts disproportionately. At some point these things reverse. We're not here to predict when, but when that does reverse, obviously we should benefit from the opposite. In terms of the client discussions that Jay talked about, client discussions for several years now have moved much away from conversations between us and the head of ops to heavily strategic conversations between us and the CEO and the CIO. And those have just accelerated for all the reasons that Jay said. And I think it's at the point now where virtually every asset management firm that hasn't done something - and by the way most haven't right. Most haven't outsourced their middle-office, most haven't moved to a platform like Charles River or Latent are talking about doing that. What Charles River has enabled us to do is just to broaden that conversation, but we're already having it. And I - we're very optimistic that this will turn into more and stronger new business as we go forward simply because our clients challenges while imposing certainly some fee pressure on us but also our future opportunities. Alex Blostein : And I guess my second question Eric maybe around NIR. So I heard you guys still expect growth sequential in the fourth quarter, maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in balance sheet trends so far in Q4? I know the ending deposits were lower and then could move around of course. So what are you seeing with respect to deposits so far in the fourth quarter? And I guess longer term as we think about the trajectory for stationary deposits in the mix interest non-interest bearing how should we think about that for next kind of 12 to 24 months? Eric Aboaf : Sure, it's Eric. The deposits have been - they've just been bouncing around at about this level here and we show around $160 billion. You get - it's hard to predict the month-by-month or even near the first two weeks of a quarter because we do get these very large spikes. Remember as one of the top custodians just think about the amount of transactions that flow through our pipes. And you do see that in the end of period balance sheet relative to the average. We did have the seasonal lightness and deposits in that August time period. We heard that in the - at some of the conferences that didn't put us off. It kind of came back as expected in September. So we have these ebbs and flows and so it's hard to divine kind of for coming quarter or coming year based on those. What I would tell you is part of the reason that we felt good about our deposits and obviously we've got to see what happens with quantitative easing and fed balancing trends and so forth is we've been very engaged with our clients on deposits over the better part of the year if not year and half. And part of that is it's a natural way for them to pay us, right, or for us to serve them. And if you remember deposits is just one of the offerings we make right. While we think of it as a set of liquidity solutions we offer to our clients. Sometimes deposit, sometimes repos, sometimes money market sweeps. And each one of those has a value to our deposits and offering that cascade is actually one of the more sophisticated discussions that we've been having with our clients over the past year or so. Anyway that's a little bit color more than anything else Alex, but we feel like we've got healthy amounts of deposits. We feel like there is relative stability there. We feel like we're sharing in the economics of appropriately where clients, earn more, we earn more as the fed rates float up upwards. And to be honest, we're continuing to turn our attention to Britain, to Europe, to Asia because there are big pools of deposits there, and we like to see prevailing interest rates rising in some of those geographies. And if they can't, that could be another opportunity for us in the coming quarter or coming quarters, I should say or coming years. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : May be just to go back on to the on servicing side, maybe I just wanted different angle on that. Obviously, we see the fee rate coming down, but it sounds like it's - as your saying, it's due to that mix away from EM and European mutual funds. I know to the extent that assets do shift towards passive an ETF. It's a lower -- it's a much lower fee. But I think Jay you've also said in the past the probability of those assets is comparable to mutual funds. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about if we can just continue to see pressure on the asset mix there and we see those fee rates come down, where do we see the offset on the expense line? Does that come through sort of right away or does that take some time to work its way through Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. Let me start on that. I think you've got the right couple buckets of drivers on fee rates right. The first is the mix in particular EM and even Europe is at a higher rate than the U.S. And then active funds are at a higher rate than passive. So, both of those play through. I think the other thing that is playing through in the fee rate is literally our -- the two of the largest transitions ever here. With BlackRock floating out, that was an old fee rate contract and had a stack of different products and services in their collective funds and that's obviously transitioning out. As we bring on Vanguard, we've been quite clear that we've started with the most core of the core products which is custody, right. And obviously, we always have discussions with large clients about bringing on other parts of the stack, but custody is one piece of that stack. And so we\u2019re kind of you're seeing the offset of a stack of services versus a one service star on trillion plus in assets. So that's the other piece that's just coming through in the quarter-on-quarter. But I think in general you have the right view. So its around mix of assets, it's around mix of underlying of fund and fund types and that's playing out. And in terms of the expensive, our perspective is the reason why we're focused on margin and reason why we're focused on operating leverage and we can - operating leverage fully or fees or their different ways to - and all the ways matter, right. We're focused on driving down our cost and increasing efficiency every year, because we know that's what this business requires. And our view is if we can do that smartly and with the - in ways that help our clients, right that can be good for them and good for us. Brian Bedell : And can you just remind me of the servicing wins to be installed in the fourth quarter and you're not including any wins that you\u2019ll be getting the fourth quarter what would that - what would the servicing installation pipeline look like coming into 2019? Eric Aboaf : We've got that in the press release servicing business to be installed with that 465 billion. You'll see that's been - that's I think - it's quite a nice level if I go back over the last eight or nine quarters that tends to be above the level which we run, which is part of the reason why we have some confidence not only in the pipeline but some of what we see in terms of revenues in the in the coming quarters. Brian Bedell : But the 465 is for the fourth quarter or is it into next year? Eric Aboaf : That's into next year right so sometimes clients come on quite quickly. If you remember the Vanguard kind of custodial client play through quickly and that was because it was simpler to put on the 465 will come through over several quarters. And obviously, what we're working on now is the pipeline and pushing through closing that pipeline, so we add more as we install more and that's just the natural cadence of the sales and then installation activity. Brian Bedell : And I just listened to the last part of your fee operating leverage comments to your prior question. Can you just repeat that what you're expectations for fee operating leverage for the full year is now with the weaker fees? Eric Aboaf : Yes I said I didn't go through in detail right. I wanted to be helpful at the end of my prepared remarks and I gave you my fourth quarter outlook by area including fees. I think you can easily now calculate estimate of all of our metrics including fee operating leverage if you just add up the first three quarters on a parachute in an estimate of fourth quarter and I think what you'll see is I think we had five main targets out there as part of our January guidance. I think we've hit many of those but not all of them and I think fee operating leverage is one that where we won't achieve what we intended. But on others, like expenses with Beacon, we started off with an intention to save $150 million this year. We're at - we've said we're confident we can do to $200 million. We've actually already to $180 million after three quarters so we have some - we have quite a bit of confidence there. And then you saw we deployed another $40 million of more tactical expense reductions just this quarter, right to add to the expense management efforts. So I'd say it's - there are number of these that we're going to hit on. Some were ultimately deliver on and others that we may not, but we're focused on navigating through this environment. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Mike Carrier : First one, just one more on the servicing side and more on the outlook, when you look at the priceline, at any context or color, on the mix of that meaning is it on the passive side, the traditional alternatives, just the assumptions. And Eric maybe just, we think about fee rates and products whether we're in risking or if we eventually get to a rerisking environment. What's the divergence on fee rates across the products that can shift things around both on the positive and negative side? Ron O'Hanley: Mike, its Ron here. Let me talk about the outlook. I think the outlook is quite strong as we've said for the reasons that we've talked about it as much because of the pain that our clients are suffering. So the nature of the outlook is less about active versus passive because typically it's what we get reflects with the underlying asset manager itself is managing. But what I would say is that the outlook more often than not - the discussion is more often than not include as you'd expect custody and fund accounting, but quite frequently the middle office. And as we look back on many of the large deals we've done, roughly half of them have been middle office plus custody and accounting. And I think that reflects just the nature of these large and medium sized asset management firms saying this isn't just about am I going to shave a little bit of fee and move it over to another custodian, but more who is able to help me improve my operating model. And so that set of discussions is rich. The pipeline is strong or all the discussions are going to result in a priceline, probably not, but I think just from the sheer amount of activity we're encouraged by the outlook for the pipeline. Eric Aboaf : And Mike let me just give you some of the kind of ranges on the fee rate. Our overall fee rate it takes servicing fees divide by AUCA is about 1.6 basis points. But the range is actually quite large within that, if you think about all there because of their complexity and the spoke nature can be five, six, seven, eight bps and that's the industry standard. ETF\u2019s are at the other edge of that can be well below - therefore half of it. But just there's a wide range mutual fund, collective funds, institutional retail are all quite different. And then the European offshore centers versus onshore centers because of the tax and accounting complexity, have you know offshore tends to be at a higher rate than onshore and offshore has been where we've had much of the flows in Europe right through the Luxembourg vehicles and the Irish vehicles which is what actually went negative in the second quarter, was dead flat in third quarter. So those are some of the - some of the maybe the ranges and the drivers and it's even when I work through and try to give guidance on something like servicing fee for fourth quarter, I mean, there's a number of different considerations and which is why the results can move even over the course of a couple of months. Mike Carrier : And then Eric, just real quick on tax was little lower I don't know if you mentioned that but just on the outlook. And then on the expenses, you guys mentioned were you on Beacon and then you mentioned the $40 million and just wanted to get some clarity on is that an addition? And when you see these like revenue pressures like where are you guys in terms of the expense base being maybe more variable versus in the past? Eric Aboaf : Let me add to those in order first on taxes then on expenses. On taxes, we had some discrete items, but the largest one was a true up on the year-end 2017 net tax package. If you remember, we had a charge in the fourth quarter of $150 million. There's a lot of information that's come through some puts and takes that but we had more, more benefits than otherwise as we trued-up on depreciation R&D in some of the many nuances that you remember we're not -- we're not finalized or had come through on the rulemaking and so that true up was worth about 3.5 points on the tax rate roughly. And I think was obviously a positive this quarter. On expenses, I think you know we think about the expense opportunities as we covered earlier at a number of different levels, right. There is enormous amount of continued opportunity as we continue through Beacon and standardized and simplified and we do that at multiple levels. And sometimes, it's in the processing shop, sometimes it's in the IT shop. So there's a whole set of, I'll call it more process engineering that we continue to do there as we \u2013 as we continue from the learning's from Beacon into the next phase. I think the management delayering and simplification as Ron described is an area of continued opportunity. And I get that the fixed costs that we've got to take out fixed costs not just variable costs as we drive down the productivity curve. And then I think the areas of third-party or non-compensation's stands as you know, if our \u2013 if our clients the asset managers are under pressure and they're asking us to see how we can do a bit better for them and giving us more business as an offset. We're going back to our vendors and say look you've got to look upstream as well, and help us deliver better for our clients. And so, we're working actively whether it's you know market data vendors, custodial vendor, contractor vendors, IT vendors, I mean it just go through the long list. And I'd say, every one of those are our vendors, but they are partners to us and they need to help us deliver what we need to on our on our productivity journey. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : If you could help me with disconnect that I have. The first part of the decade, statutory claim victory for business OP and IT transformation. The second part of a decade is claiming success for Project Beacon which is about done. Today's press release says, quote solid performance but year-to-date pre-tax margin. It looks like its worst in class, the same as it was in 2011. You highlight some recent derisking and certainly EM hurts but for most the decade you had a lot of risk going and a lot of higher stock market. So three questions, number one, you alluded to new expense efforts. Will there be a new expense program in 2019 or in the next few years ahead? And again it's getting all the saving from Project Beacon but not showing deposit of leverage, not showing the improvement in pre-tax margin. So I guess the hope for expectation be a new expense program would lead what for the pre-tax margin? Number two, how do you guys think about governance, because we hear Jay saying things that are good solid performance, and he is the outgoing CEO. And then Ron you are the new CEO taking over next year and there seems to be a little gap, and this is one of the longest CEO transition in a while, so if you can comment on governance? And three, in terms of a strategic pivot, you highlighted Charles River partly through pivot strategically to stage three, think about a larger strategic pivot perhaps even a combination with a brokerage firm, bank or asset manager you had to deal yesterday. So what are your thoughts about expenses, governance and acquisitions? Thanks. Jay Hooley : Mike, why don't I start that on expenses. So your specific question is, are we planning to employ a new expense program either at the end of this year in 2019? And the answer is at this point, I don't think we need to, because there is intense focus on expenses now and much of the programs you cited in the past have provided \u2013 one, they provided savings; two, they provided foundation for the next one. And I look forward and the rest of us look forward and see lots of opportunity to continue to manage our expenses, and to do that in concert with improving our product and improving outcomes for clients. So, I just don't see that we actually have to announce a separate program because I would argue that that's what we're doing. The other thing, Mike, we want to be clear on here and I think we've said this in our materials is we do continue to invest. And we're investing one to continue to get more of that expense out and to make sure it's enduring expense reduction, so that it's not just belt-tightening, but that in fact we're actually getting end-to-end processing in place that we're actually getting real automation that we're getting kind of full usage out of the global hubs. And to continue to improve our offering to clients. So, I mean the easy way out of this would be I supposed to just stop investing, but we don't see that as an option given what we're trying to do to maintain competitive superiority. Eric Aboaf : Mike's, it's Eric. I'd just also emphasize that we did ITOT as multi-year program over three or four years. We've done Beacon over three are four years and have completed sooner. I think we're quite comfortable now that we have the tools I described the levels to a different expense levers. And that's naturally can be folded into an annual program and we have every intention as we've discussed this here among the three of us that in January is a natural time to tell here is how much we plan on taking out of the expense base here the areas in which we'll be doing that and here's what to expect in the coming year. And then use that as the cadence by which as we give guidance, we give guidance on revenues, on operating leverage, on NII to cover what our intentions are in a very practical and specific way on expenses. So I think you can plan on that in our January call. In terms of the metrics, I think -- I do think it's worth stepping back to the metrics. And I like how you do it over half a decade, a decade and I know you're senior of this industry for even longer. But ROE, right hit 14% this quarter, up almost two points on a year-to-date basis right? And that's ROE, that's not return on tangible common equity extra goodwill that gets reported by many of our peers, which in our case is 19%. But like classic ROE 14% for the quarter for year-to-date. Margin which I think you've got a look at both the gap margin because we do more tax advantage investing than other peers, but if you wanted to do on a normalized basis, it's in the 31% range is I think pretty healthy. And clearly, we don't have an anonymous lending book like others do which tends to make margins even wider. But I think we're quite comfortable with the margins that we have in the 30% range on a -- 31% range on an operating basis. And you'll see our GAAP margins continue to build. So I think we are very focused on driving expenses that are calibrated to revenues and we have a good strong way to continue to do that. Jay Hooley : So, Mike, let me - this is Jay I think that was the first question. Let me pick up the second and then reach to the third. The Ron and my transition is going quite well at the end of the year. I will phase out and become Chairman and Ron will take over the CEO role. And he is well-equipped, but I think this year has given us both good transition time with clients, employees and more recently shareholders. Let me go to your CRD question. I think that we still like the space. The space being the trust and custody business because we think it has global expansion possibilities. We think that it will still grow as asset still grow, as they go from government to retirement. So the secular macro picture I think still looks pretty good to us. Having said that, this business over many decades is been a business of evolution and custodians, if you call us custodians continuing to evolve to find points of differentiation. And so - and I think we have been leaders in that whether it's been finding the international opportunity whether it was finding the ETF opportunity, whether it was being first of the hedge fund opportunity. More recently moving into the middle-office where we now have a $10 trillion plus scale business that's bridging into that data GX angle. And the next big frontier is the front-office and not just the front-office but connecting the front-office to back office. And you'd only have to be some of these conversations to realize that when you have CEOs across the table and we\u2019ll now acknowledge this that this business has been built up overtime with huge inefficiencies in multiple systems. And they now view State Street as not only having the foresight to be there first but having the fortitude to build this front middle back-office business that will help them compete in the next decade. So I think that your point of is there more to do? Is there more dramatics to do? I think the big dramatic we just did, which is to launch into the front-office. I think that to do is to net all these things together and I think that will define how this business looks into the future. Ron O'Hanley: Yes, what I would add to that Mike is that in terms of does that necessarily mean that we are going to be force to do more acquisitions or to do kind of dramatic types of corporate actions like you saw yesterday with Invesco and Oppenheimer. We don't see that need right now. With Charles River and the platform that we're building and our organic activities, we feel like we've got what we need. We can build out organically to the extent to which there is something that make sense to augment our capabilities and have the financial criteria that we would like to see will do that but we don't \u2013 we're not here saying what was us we need an acquisition. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just asking it this way on the expense question, do you think that going forward you can generate positive the operating leverage relative to organic growth? Eric Aboaf : Jim it's Eric. I think we'll have to positive fee operating leverage. It's certainly a good objective to have organic growth is hard to I think analytically \u2013 like we have to clarify the terms, because remember how this business model works that will build up over years on servicing fees, right. There is a piece of servicing fee revenues that comes from market appreciation. There's a piece that comes typically from flows and the client activity and that actually has gone negative this quarter. There is a piece from net new business and share shift as we continue to consolidate or we move up value chain and there\u2019s always a little bit of pricing that we worked through. So there's a set of four elements. And I think our view is and \u2013 there is four elements on the fee side and then there are deposits now. And I think the deposit conversation continues to become more important because of the positions our clients are in and in ways to even remunerate us for some of the services that we provide. So I think overtime as we \u2013 we want to drive expenses down and expenses cannot grow faster than total revenues. I think that's just a fact, right. Our margins need to continue to float upwards and that's our \u2013 we have \u2013 we're all \u2013 that's going to be a very clear bar. I think there will be time-to-time where we focus on the operating leverage when we might be getting unusual benefit from NII because of the rates tailwind or when we have a downdraft in rates because you want to kind of peel that a part. But I think in more normalized times, we probably do want to focus on total operating leverage, but there is -- I'm one of those folks who believe that every measure has a purpose and a place and we should keep an eye on all of them. Jay Hooley : Jim, I would just add to Eric's point on your organic growth question is that the other factor is consolidation amongst custodians and that continues to happen. And for the most part, we tend to - tended to be the beneficiary in that as clients are moved from multiple custodians through either to one or towards one. Jim Mitchell : And maybe a follow-up Eric on just the other expense line that dropped I think $45 million sequentially, is there anything unusual in there? Or is that just Beacon savings that might become somewhat sustainable going forward? I know you highlighted the expenses in the fourth quarter only up slightly. So is that a reason or a new kind of run rate to think about in other or how do anything unusual in there? Eric Aboaf : Yes that one bounces around a little bit. It bounces around quite a bit and there is a series of different elements there. So I just be careful about that one and I try to use kind of multi quarter view of that. There are big lumpy items like professional fees which moves around by $10 million because those been both IT and non-IT. And some of the regulatory initiatives there are large items like insurance and that -- including the FDIC insurance with a substance coming in and out and so forth. There are TNE flows through that line. And As I mentioned that one was particularly well-controlled this quarter. There is litigation that kind of -- that bumps through that line and that can make it move. That actually wasn't significant this quarter, but can make it move. So there is I think it's a one that's always going to be lumpy, but our view is there are 15 kind of sublines there at the first quarter and we've got initiatives in each of those 15. And one where there is a significant amount of I'll call non-comp and benefit spend that we can and will control. Operator : Our next question is from Geoffrey Elliott of Autonomous. Geoffrey Elliott : You mentioned EM quite a few times as one of the drivers of pressure on servicing fees. I wonder if you could do anything to help quantify that help us in future, have a better feeling for how weakness in EM or strength EM is going to feed through into that line? Eric Aboaf : Geoff, its Eric. I've been wrestling with your question because in -- I think just like you'd like see it better, I'd like to find ways to disclose it better. I think if you think about our disclosures, we have good disclosures on what happens when markets appreciate or depreciate and how that affects servicing fees. And part of your question makes me think can I turn that into a disclosure on emerging markets versus developed markets. So I'm just kind of thinking it through as yet the question. I think there's a related set of disclosures that we make verbally and on our supply decks, but maybe you are encouraging us to see if we can quantify. But if flows are negative in U.S. active funds or flows are negative in emerging markets by x or sufficiently different from the average, right. How much could that mean in terms of impact on service fee growth or decline? I mean, I think that's the kind of question you're asking. So I don't have a prospective answer for you. We have that deep in our analytics. Let me just take it on as an option you see, if we can add more overtime. Because I think what you're looking for is the kind of the first order approximation of how these different trends impact us. And we'll do some work to see, if we can get some more out there and some rules of thumb knowing that fix as we've talked about today creates an enormous kind of fuzziness over those rules of thumb. But let's - we'll add a little bit of context and thought there for you. Geoffrey Elliott : I think that just kind of helps get away from the mechanical S&P up and MSCI World up, asset servicing fees must be up as well. And then second one on Charles River you mentioned you're going to give some more color around expectations for that at a conference later in the quarter. What are you kind of waiting for? What are you still putting together before you can come out with those numbers on how CRD is going to impact you for? Jay Hooley : So the biggest change that you have to do besides just integrating Charles River into our systems and our close process and so forth. And we've owned it now for 18 days is we have to complete the work on the accounting 606 implementation of revenue recognition. If you recall, we as a bank did that January one of this year as did most of the other banks and asset managers and it was quite significant to them. We literally have to do that with Charles River which means you literally have pull every contract and go through every contract. Bucket it between on-premises versus cloud each of those has term or doesn't have term and how much term. There is an upfront revenue recognition. In some cases, there is an overtime in others. And so it's literally contracts - it's a manual exercise and the teams been intensely working through that. At that point, I'll be able to give you an estimate of fourth quarter revenues but I'd like to do that once and well for you. We have a rough estimates and we've had them for since the spring and summer. But I'd like to be honest, to finish that work, I'd like to close October and maybe November results under GAAP standards as opposed to private company more cash accounting that's often been done and then, share that with you. So that's the work. We've got a couple of opportunities. Certainly, by December, we'll the first week or two in December, we'll certainly do that for you. And our intention is to share with you here is the GAAP revenue estimates or range for fourth quarter here's the expenses and EBIT. And here are probably some of the metrics that will be tracking for you, right. So this is one of those where there's a pipeline, there's a beyond a pipeline, there is a set of booked - contractually booked activity. And then there is an installation period and then it turns into revenue and so it will come back with the some of the leading indicators as well. So that will be - but will do that very proactively and we'll do that obviously during the latter part of the fall here, so that everyone is well prepared as we go into the end of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start off with a question on the securities portfolio. The duration is expanded for each of the past few quarters. The most recent one it was at 3.3 years. If I look at the peers set, they're actually running a little bit below too. And I'm just wondering given the market expectation for multiple rate hikes, flatter yield curve what's really driving the decision to extend the duration at this point in time? And maybe as it is just quick follow-up, how we should think about the impact that we'll have on the pace of asset yield expansion in the context of the mix of the next versus portions of the book? Eric Aboaf : Steve, it's Eric. There's lots that goes into the design of investment portfolio and I'd share with you a bit - a couple of bits of context. The first is, now we've always run a very short portfolio here in particular because it was a large opportunity in rising rates at the shorthand. And you've seen that that's been quite remunerative for us and continues to be quarter-after-quarter. So what you're seeing us do is I think effectively just starting to balance out the portfolio as rates get higher, right, because as rates went from near zero to north of 200 basis points at the front-end and north of 300 basis points in the back-end, right. At some point we have to as bankers all begin to prevent and say, when do I want lock in some of the duration? I don't want to do all in one day or one month or one quarter, but I do want to take advantage of that curve because that curve has current earnings benefits on one hand and it's an anticipation of at some point the fed stops raising rates maybe we a couple of years from now go through another business cycle and rates come down. And when rates come down you do want to have that duration in place. So look at a context on we are kind of -- we are still -- I think still I think we're still relatively short from an interest rate sensitivity perspective. And remember we have more fixed-rate deposits in most of our peers so we tend to need more fixed-rate asset. So you got to keep that in mind as you benchmark us with some of the other universals or regionals in particular. And there is question of navigating through the cycle. I think to summarize that we're actually quite pleased with the performance of the portfolio the performance of NII and NIM. And we continue to seek good upside even with this duration every rate hike is probably worth almost $10 million a quarter in the coming quarters with this level of investment positioning, and so both good earnings and good upside in our minds. Steven Chubak : And just one follow-up for me on some of the non-interest bearing deposit commentary from earlier. You alluded to stability in that deposit base of around 160 but the non-interest bearing deposits at least end-to-end decline 20%. I know there's a lot of volatility around the end-of-period balance sheet, but just given that the share magnitude of the decline I was hoping you could speak to what drove that acceleration at the end of the quarter? And maybe what's the reasonable expectation for non-interest bearing deposits in 4Q, just so we can comfortable that that pace of decline should not continue? Eric Aboaf : Let me, kind of, tackle that from a couple of different perspectives. The first is I think the average deposits have been in this kind of 160-ish range in aggregate. I think what we have seen on a year-over-year basis than a quarter-over-quarter basis we've seen it for us and every bank has seen it. It continued I'll call it rotation out of non-interest bearing into interest bearing. And on a quarter-to-quarter basis that is 5%, so literally 2 billion of 35 billion rotates out and that from a non-interest bearing into interest bearing and that's just I think what is completely to be expected given where we are in the interest rate cycle. And I think you've seen other banks that show that. You've seen some show actually a faster rotation than that. I think we\u2019re quite comfortable with the pace of this rotation. What's hard to perfectly forecast is what's the future pace of that\u2019s going to be day and will it level off? I think we all believe it will level off at some point, because there are different segments who hold non-interest bearing deposits. In particular a number of the hedge funds are all terminated providers for whom we do servicing, they tend to hold non-interest bearing deposits with us probably because those are less valuable for us and other banks under the regulatory rules, and probably because that's the way to pay us for our services. And some of that is probably relatively sticky for the duration and through cycle. So, other parts of that 35 billion of non-interest bearing deposits that will just continue to gently rotate through. And what I tell you is we keep modeling it and the rotation keeps being a little less than expected. And well that doesn't provide certainty to the future it gives us some indication that the pattern here is a pattern that we can just use as a way to forecast from. So anyway hopefully that's enough color. I think deposits in particular because we're at this higher rate of portion and the cycle, right. We're trying to get higher rate finally, which is nice to see in the U. S. and because of the fed, the reversals fed easing, and the reversal of the fed done, it's always hard to forecast. And so we're just navigating through carefully and working very closely with our clients quarter-to-quarter to serve them in this function. Steven Chubak : Just very quick follow-up. I know that you mentioned that it's difficult to forecast the deposit trajectory, but since the correlation is so high between your deposits and industry-wide excess reserves, do you feel that the reasonable proxy that we could track while also contemplating some organic growth? Eric Aboaf : I think you couldn't. I think that I have less confidence in the direct correlation to be in excess reserves in our deposits. Why? Because our deposits are the remaining kind of frictional deposits by enlarge that exists as the custodian where you got the asset manager or the pension fund or the asset owner who moved a lot of fund back and forth. They need some frictional deposits with you, so that they don't draw on their overdraft lines which they tend to be low to do. So they use it as a way to you would balance keep some funds in a checking account. And I think we've pushed off most of what I've described excess deposits that might directly correlate to the reserve. What I tried to do from a deposit forecasting perspective to be honest I look at the Fed deposit report. There is the HA report that come out weekly and then the monthly version of those. And I think there is overall deposits the banking system that were proxy for overall deposits in the banking system. Those have been inching up it was at 4% 5% for a little while. Now it's closer to 2%, 3% a year right now sometimes 1%. So that's a good proxy. And I think the question is we certainly want to grow deposits at that rate. With assets in their custody growing and new business wins part of the discussion that we're having now I think more than we've ever had before is hey as you're bring custody assets what deposits are you going to bring with you? How do you make sure that you keep right amount of deposit with us? How do we serve you well with those deposits or with repo or some of the other end? So I think as you see assets under custody grow, there should be deposits that come with those and that's another part of the modeling that I do. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had one question. When you look at that servicing fee and I do appreciate the additional color that you gave us this quarter. But ever since Project Beacon's been launched you've had nothing but pretty much linear trend down on your asset servicing fee rate. I mean - and I get that there are some categories that do have higher fee rate, but I mean when you think about the legacy of book of business that you have why is -- why should we just not assume that that just continues to reprice lower over time? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. Just first order though remember that since we launched Beacon right we've had a run-up in market and equity market levels right appreciation. Just think of in 2017 equity markets spike nicely 20% depending on what the time period. During that period remember what happens is then we disclosed in our queue that you don't have a linear effect on servicing fees. We described 10% up in equity markets or 10% up in fixed income markets increases servicing fee revenue between 1% and 3%. So, automatically as markets appreciate, our fee rate by definition will flow downwards right just because they aren't linear right? The fees are not linear with markets like they are in the more classic asset management industry. So I think in appreciating markets you're always going to get sum floating down. I think the -- that's kind of first order effect. The second order affects are what are interesting which is what else happens, next happens there's a little bit of fee discussions with clients, but there is more services that we continue to add as well whether it's middle-office or all for someone who we just do mutual funds and so on and so forth. And so there is a series of other effects. And then if you recall, as well, as you have ETF dominating flows in the U.S. in particular. Right? And the outflows, right, we've had, what, now two or three years of inflows into ETF and out of actives in the U.S. Right? That has a downward pressure on our fee rate as well. So, anyway, I think, there are two dominant ones. One is just market appreciation affects the math and the - kind of the swing to ETFs in the U.S. affects the math. And then there are a number of other pieces that we - that we'll influence at quarter to quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Couple of questions. Just shifting gears a little bit to asset management fees, seeing then that fee growth has also been a little bit slower than AUM growth. Any comments on pricing trends there? Ron O'Hanley: Vivek, this is Ron. You're seeing in terms of asset management fees. You're seeing what I would describe as a pressure and in some cases accelerating pressure on asset management fees. A lot of our business, as you know, is either index or quantitative. And particularly on the index side, institutional index has been \u2013 quite a bit of fee pressure there. Investors are looking for everything they can to reduce their fees. So, yes, the pressure remains. We expect it to continue to be there. But at some level it's almost got to moderate, because you're approaching a point where people are going to \u2013 institutions are going to just start turning away from the business. Vivek Juneja : So, Ron, you don't think you're going to have to match your former institution's zero fee rate pricing on any of your ETFs? Ron O'Hanley: No, it's a longer question. I believe that if you look at the rationale for why the fidelities and others are contemplating this, they're using it really more in the context of a retail environment and using it as a way to attract customers in. And also using - typically they're using those vehicles as building blocks for a bigger kind of retail SMA. So I think it's not quite as comparable to what our business is here, but your point, Vivek, is a good one and that the overall kind of fee pressure, it's another factor. Jay Hooley : And one of the things we do continue to do right. We've got the ETF business. We also have the OCIO business. And I think part of the trends we're seeing is, there is some fee pressure on more of the legacy institutional activity. And on the other hand, if some of the barbelling and expansion of some of that OCIO business does provide some offset to that and we're also seeing that. I think, year-to-date our fee rate was relatively flat in asset management and that's - those are effects. Those kind of veiling effects are - you can see in the numbers. Vivek Juneja : And did you - normally in the third quarter, do you not see some seasonal benefit from performance fees? It didn't seem like we saw that this quarter. Am I missing something? Jay Hooley : It depends by - we're fairly global and so it depends, kind of, on quarter-on-quarter market levels and then fund-by-fund. But remember emerging markets were down and equity is good quarter. International was down as well with only the U.S. it's kind of back here at home where it feels good, so I think there wasn\u2019t the average to be relatively neutral this quarter. Vivek Juneja : And one more if I may on the servicing fees items, I'm sure you're getting a long call on that. But just while we're all on the topic over the - this is going back over the years, Jay, you've always talked about middle office business, providing new stickiness, which generally translates into also helping somewhat the pricing erosion. We haven't seen that obviously. I think we don't need to go into that. But given that trend, given everything that's going on, is there a reason why the CRD offering doesn't just become another free offering overtime? Just given what we've seen over now a decade in this industry? Jay Hooley : I think its - Vivek this is Jay. I think the front-office and CRD is different. It's at the central nervous system of these asset management firms. it's a conversation with a different level of clientele than we\u2019ve dealt with in the typical back-office, middle-office services, so I don't think it's the same. I think that the value that we see inherent in the front-office is the obvious piece, which is to create connectivity and efficiency through the middle and back, but the bigger value is we view this front-office initiative as not just the software platform, but rather a platform that can network other investments capabilities whether it's liquidity or other things into it. So, I think it's a different conversation with a different clientele and has a different value proposition. Ron O'Hanley: I'd add to that, Vivek. I think that it - these are not commodities that we're talking about here. What we're talking about is working with fund managers or asset owners that act like fund managers and how do we help them add value to their investment process, how do we help them simplify their overall operation and lower their costs, so there\u2019s a real value element tied to this that I think will enable us to keep the pricing discussion quite separate. Operator : Our final question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Eric, you touched on a moment ago the revenues and the servicing fees with markets going up or down, the range 1% to 3% of how they are impacted. Can you exclude the net interest income revenue for a moment and just look at your total fee revenue, what percentage of total fee revenue is linked to the value of assets under custody or management. Years ago, I know it was much higher, it\u2019s lower today but where does this sit today? Eric Aboaf : If you think about total fee revenue is where you've got servicing fees, management fees, FX fees, securities, finance fees. I think we start to get impacted by the large numbers on the averages. And so I think the disclosure we tend to do is the three in 10 out of equities, the one in 10 for fixed income. It's hard to kind of on a every quarter basis be precise about that, right? So if markets go up, but FX volatility goes down. I've got FX fees going in the opposite direction. So I'm - while it's true on average, right, which is how the disclosures are clearly made, I think the market sensitivity is a tough one to pin down to be honest. I think what we can say confidently is that most of our fees, right, are market sensitive, but they are sometimes market sensitive to market levels, to market volatility and to market flows, right? And so, as a result, if the first question is what percentage of our fees are market sensitive? I'd say, most of them are. If you'd say, well, what part of market sensitivity level flow or volatility? I'd say, it's a mix of those three and different mix of each of those three for each of the different fee lines that we report. Gerard Cassidy : And then another follow-up question. I'm glad you've called out the ROE number that you guys reported since I think many investors point to the ROE as a good indication of evaluation on a price to book basis. So when I go back and look at State Street in the 1990s this company almost always reported ROEs in the high-teens and then we went into the tech boom and they actually got into the mid-20s, then following the tech before the financial crisis, they drifted down into the mid-teens. We had to step down, we all know following the financial crisis with the increased levels of capital that you're all required to carry. So there was a step function down. With your ROE now up around 120 basis points, which is one of the highest that State Street has achieved over that time period. Is it really just a matter of leverage that the ROEs are just never going to be able to get back up to high teens or is it no it's not leverage it's the structural pricing issue. And if you have to get pricing back maybe we'll see higher ROEs? Eric Aboaf : I think, Gerard, it's Eric. Let me start on that. I think I don't have the luxury that you have of being in the business for as many decades, but for the decade and half that I've been in this business both here and then as part of the universal bank, I think the single biggest change pre-crisis to post-crisis is the capital requirements and the capital requirements cover, what you'd expect a little bit of market risk, a little bit of credit risk and operational risk, right, with sort of these the core what we do and those capital requirements are not perfect, right. Many have said they\u2019re imperfect, but they are real and are part of running a bank. I think we used to have processing houses that were not banks, most of them are banks today. And so as a result I think we are in a somewhat different zone than where we might have been a couple of decades ago. That said, if we're reaching to 14% now in ROE, if the following question you might ask as well, is there is more upside, I do think there is more upside because I think there is upside in margin, there is upside in what we do for our clients, there is upside kind of balance sheet optimization and management and so we have expectations. I think that margins will flowed up and ROE flowed up and I think what the destination maybe, it's hard to - I think that one is still open but we see upside maybe just not what maybe not what you\u2019ve may have recalled from the 90s. Gerard Cassidy : And Eric you might ask Jay about the role of our back in the 1990s. Those are always good meetings we had. Jay Hooley : Thanks, Gerard. Laura, does that conclude the questions? Operator : Yes, we have no further questions, sir. Jay Hooley : All right. Thank you and thank everybody else for your attention this morning. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. With that, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Good morning, everyone. As you know, this is my first opportunity to address you since becoming State Street\u2019s CEO at the start of 2019.  Let me turn to slide 3. We announced our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial results this morning and I want to start by providing some context in terms of the overall environment, addressing our performance and then importantly, focus the bulk of my comments outlining what we\u2019re going to do differently going forward. Market dynamics are changing for our clients. The shift from active to passive means thinner fees as well as more competition amongst managers who are increasingly challenged to outperform their peers and consequently face lower volumes and thinner fees themselves.  The resulting margin compression for investment managers has led them to increase pressure on their providers. Asset owners, facing inadequate returns, are similarly pressuring providers to do more for less. In turn, these same clients need better technology and streamlined operations to increase their ability to generate alpha more efficiently and reduce operating costs.  Given these headwinds for our clients, we are adapting strategically to become increasingly more competitive, offer greater functionality and be the essential partner to our clients. I have made it clear to my colleagues at State Street and want to make it clear to you, we want to better drive our own destiny and more effectively manage our exposure to market headwinds. That means change, real change that I will talk about today and in the year ahead. Year-over-year, our revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by strong performance in net interest income and FX trading as well as the contribution from the recently acquired Charles River development business. We are encouraged by the continued interest we are seeing in CRD with a total of 98 client engagements since announcing the deal. These positive trends were offset by unfavorable market conditions, including the significantly down markets during the fourth quarter and ongoing fee compression, which impacted our servicing fee revenues. Assets under custody and administration decreased quarter-over-quarter, reflecting lower equity market levels and client transitions. Fourth quarter new servicing business wins were 140 billion.  Additionally, at quarter end, AUCA yet to be installed totaled approximately 385 billion. At 1.9 trillion for the full year of 2018, we experienced a record level of new servicing wins. State Street Global Advisors was also impacted by the market environment as our business has a disproportionate exposure to equity markets and other risk on asset classes, such as high yield. Assets under management decreased quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by weaker equity markets as well as institutional and cash outflows, partially offset by ETF net inflows.  While SSGA results are not yet where we would like them to be, we have been working to diversify our business mix, leverage relationships across State Street and fill in offerings as we take advantage of the shift from products to solutions. These offerings include asset allocation, exposure management and outsourced CIO as well as demand for a range of ETF products. For example, this quarter, we saw good organic growth in our European ETFs and our low cost US ETFs and remain confident that our strategy of targeted growth in areas such as ETFs, OCIO and other multi asset solutions and ESG, just to name a few, will drive future growth. Regarding our overall bottom line performance simply put, we need to and can do better. That means reigniting servicing fee growth in a sustainable way, reducing costs across our organization and building upon the advances that we have made in digitization and automation. Collectively, this means being faster and smarter about how we deliver solutions that solve our client's greatest challenges. Our capital position is strong. Moreover, we are optimistic the balance sheet repositioning actions completed during 2018 better position us for the 2019 CCAR cycle, supporting stronger levels of capital return for our shareholders. In light of our recent results and ongoing industry dynamics, we are taking immediate action on expenses to ensure that we become a more efficient organization for our clients and shareholders alike. I have implemented a firm wide hiring freeze for all non-critical roles. We are rolling out a rigorous new performance management system and are structurally compressing and reducing the senior management pyramid by 15%, while improving spans and reducing layers across the bank by 25% to create a more agile and accountable organization.  These actions are enabled by the beacon work and the consolidation of work into our global hubs. Thus, we are confident in our ability to execute quickly. In fact, initial reductions have already occurred. Additionally, we are focused on addressing inefficiencies across our entire expense base and have launched a new cost savings program that will continue through 2019 to reduce structural expenses, while also enabling us to invest in the business appropriately. As part of that program, which Eric will cover shortly, we recorded a 223 million pretax repositioning charge, the benefits from which we expect to fully realize within 12 to 15 months. Let me turn to slide 4. Slide 4 outlines my vision for State Street. We intend to be the leading asset servicer, asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world\u2019s capital. This vision will be driven by five strategic priorities.  One, we will increase core fee growth by becoming an essential partner to our clients, gaining share of wallet and building enduring institutional relationships. The issues faced by our clients have moved services, technology and operations to the C suite agenda. Thus, we are upgrading our client coverage model to meet these needs. These changes, including new senior leadership, are already underway. Two, we must deploy the industry's leading front to back asset servicing platform as a technology driven scale provider. Three, we will continue to innovate to grow diversified revenue streams, including new markets and NII opportunities. Four, we must generate structural expense saves by automating key processes to reduce unit costs and by leveraging our global hubs and scale among other initiatives. And five, become a more high performing organization through flattening our structure, increasing the speed of decision making and evolving our employees\u2019 skill base around our technology and data priorities. Executing against the strategic vision will require concerted action and select investments, which I'm driving forward across the business. At the same time, we need to do more to improve performance in the short term, which is evidenced by our actions announced today. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and 2018 results, I'd like to take a moment on slide 5 to discuss notable items and how they impacted our financials. In 4Q 18, we recognized 223 million of pretax repositioning costs, consisting of severance and real estate write offs. This charge is in response to the challenging industry conditions and includes the organizational streamlining and de-layering actions that Ron announced last month. I'll have more to say on how we are tackling expenses later in the presentation, including details in our new 350 million expense initiative announced today. In addition, we also had 24 million of acquisition restructuring costs related primarily to Charles River, which was below our original estimate, 24 million related to the sale of a small alternative servicing business in the Channel Islands and 50 million of legal and related costs. In total, we recognized notable items of 321 million pretax or $0.64 a share. On page 6, we show our GAAP results in the top two panels as well as our results ex the notable items I just described for those of you who want to see some of our underlying trends. On this basis, we didn't achieve our fee operating leverage goal, but we did deliver a positive operating leverage overall in 2018. Now, moving to slide 7, 4Q18 EPS of $1.04 was down 44% quarter-on-quarter, but up 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of our 4Q18 repositioning charge and the 4Q17 tax reform costs. For the full year 2018, our GAAP EPS of $6.40 was up 22% over 2017. Looking at 4Q18, return on equity was down 6.5 percentage points sequentially, primarily related to the quarter's notable expense items. For the full year 2018, ROE was up 1.6 percentage points from full year 2017. Overall, we saw growth in both EPS and ROE on a full year basis, driven by NII growth through active balance sheet management and higher interest rates, FX trading, where we continue to gain share, the acquisition of CRD and lower taxes. We are however disappointed by our performance in several of our fee businesses and I'll describe the drivers and our additional actions on the next few pages.  Turning to slide 8, our end of period AUCA and AUM levels were significantly impacted by the sharp sell-off in equity markets during the end of the fourth quarter as well as the cumulative effect of industry flows in the past year. As you know and as we have summarized on the right side of this page, global equity markets were down 6% to 17% in 2018, after posting double digit gains in 2017. At the same time, cumulative industry flows were dramatically down after significant inflows during last year and client transaction activity was muted, as investors sat on the sidelines. As a result, we saw AUCA levels fall 7% quarter-on-quarter and 5% year-on-year, while AUM levels fell 11% and 10% respectively. Moving to slide 9, I want to spend some time unpacking total revenues, which were up 1% quarter-on-quarter and up 5% year-on-year. Servicing fees, shown in the dark blue piece of the stacked bar on the left side of the page were down 4% quarter-on-quarter and 7% year-on-year. Let me give you some color. On both the sequential quarter and year-over-year basis, we had a 2 to 3 point reduction in servicing fees due to falling global equity markets. In addition, we've recently been seeing industry pricing pressure of about 1 percentage point per quarter over the last year.  The cumulative effect has caused a material year-on-year downdraft in servicing fees. And we also had one previously disclosed client transition, which was worth about 2 percentage points year-on-year, which was offset by net new business and client activity. To put these numbers in context, the long term appreciation in equity markets has typically lifted servicing fees on average by about 2 percentage points annually over the last 5 years. Positive client flows and client transactional activity have added another 2 percentage points annually and net new business has also generated 2 percentage points of annual growth, all of which have been partially offset by typical pricing headwinds of just under 2 percentage points annually.  This year has been particularly challenging though, since we've seen twice the average historical pricing headwinds. Without the tailwind of market appreciation nor client flows and activity that are inherent in our pricing structure. We have thus undertaken meaningful initiatives to combat these headwinds, such as upgrading our client coverage program and strengthening pricing discipline through our new pricing governance process. And since we need to focus on what we can control, we are even more resolute that we need to actively manage our expense base lower, which I'll discuss further in a few minutes. Turning to slide 10, let me briefly discuss our other fee revenues. Beginning with management fees, 4Q revenue was up 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by revenue recognition adoption, but down 7% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower equity markets as well as net outflows in our equity focused institutional business. SSGA continues to focus on expanding our relationships and product categories that offer higher margin. 4Q FX trading services saw continued strong performance, up 19% year-over-year, driven by higher FX volumes and volatility. We continue to differentiate our FX offerings with clients, driven by the breadth and depth of our capabilities.  4Q securities finance revenues were down 6% quarter-on-quarter and 18% year-on-year, reflecting lower assets on loan and lower spreads as clients de-leverage and industry demand fell. I would note that the business continues to evolve after the CCAR related counterparty adjustments. We've navigated these changes quite smoothly in FX, but continue to work through the effects in agency lending. Finally, we saw a significant step up in processing fees with the addition of CRD for the first time in our fourth quarter financials. We continue to be excited by the acquisition, we're pleased with its performance and remain confident in our previously announced revenue and cost synergies. As you can see, on the lower right of the slide, CRD saw net new bookings of 14 million for 4Q18. We have announcer our new client advisory board and delivered higher than expected fourth quarter revenues of 121 million on 39 million of expenses. We also incurred 18 million of amortization costs and 24 million of acquisition costs associated with CRD this past quarter. While CRD is enjoying real momentum, I would caution you against simply annualizing these 4Q results, given the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue accounting reporting standard. Now on to slide 11, we saw continued NII growth and NIM expansion during the fourth quarter. Our NII was up 4% quarter-on-quarter due to the Fed hikes we saw in September and December as well as a one-time benefit of approximately 6 million from hedging activities. 4Q NII was up 13% year-on-year, driven by higher US interest rates and discipline liability pricing, while NIM expanded 7 basis points quarter-on-quarter and 17 basis points year-on-year. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our average level deposits remained fairly steady and our betas remained similar to last quarter at just over 50%. We were also pleased to see an increase in our lending activity during the quarter. All of this bodes well for a full year 2019. Now turning to expenses, as we indicated earlier in the call, we are extraordinarily focused on managing expenses in this challenging revenue environment. I'll start by summarizing our expenses on an underlying basis, excluding notable items in Charles River and then discuss our efforts during 3Q and 4Q to keep our second half expenses flat to the first half on that basis. I'll then summarize the new expense savings program we just announced today. Beginning on slide 12, you can see that our underlying basis 4Q18 expenses were up 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, driven largely by the year-over-year adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard as well as technology investments. From a line item perspective, and relative to 4Q17, comp and employee benefits were well controlled, increasing just 1%, reflecting technology contractor and annual merit increases, partially offset by beacon savings and lower performance based incentive compensation, given our disappointing results. Information systems increased reflecting infrastructure enhancements as well as additional investments to support growth. Transaction processing costs were down as we renegotiated sub-custodian savings for a second quarter in a row. Occupancy costs were down as a result of continued progress in optimizing our global footprint. Now turning the slide 13, as the extent of the challenging revenue conditions became clear last spring, we committed to actually managing our quarterly expenses, so as to keep second half expenses flat to first half on an underlying basis. As you see on the left side of this page, we deliver on this commitment, but we know we need to do more. On the right side of the page, we summarize the progress in our Beacon savings, which totaled 245 million in 2018 as well as additional tactical actions and savings, which included a down payment on our 2019 program. These savings include the start of management de-layering, contracts under savings, the renegotiation of certain sub-custodial relationships and better control of discretionary spending. Now to slide 14, in light of our current macroeconomic and industry conditions impacting revenues, we have launched a significant new expense savings program. In total, this program is designed to achieve 350 million of in year expense savings during 2019 or approximately 4% of our expense base, which is larger than our previous efforts. On the right side of the page, you'll see the two major categories we've identified, resource discipline and process engineering and automation, with expected savings of approximately 160 million and 190 million respectively. Resource discipline includes a previously announced 15% reduction in senior management, the rollout of a more rigorous performance management system to better control headcount and further vendor management savings and the continued tackling of our real estate footprint. Process engineering and automation benefits are expected to include the reduction of approximately 6% of our workforce or 1500 roles in high cost locations. Staffing assessments were recently done as part of our shift to a more globalized model and we are now able to take further advantage of automation, and standardized processes and lower cost per person.  We also intend to streamline three operational hubs and two joint ventures as well as continue the drive towards common technology platforms and the retirement of legacy applications. The initiation of certain portions of this program results in the 4Q repositioning charge that I mentioned, which we described in the left side of the page. Even though this charge is good payback, we know we need to reduce the size of these charges going forward, which is why we've rolled out a new performance management system and headcount control. Moving to slide 15, our capital ratios ended the year, similar to those of a year ago with tier 1 leverage of 7.2% and a standardized set 1 of 11.5%. We also undertook certain balance sheet and counterparty actions in the fourth quarter to be better positioned for the 2019 CCAR process. As you see on the left side of the page, we shifted the investment portfolio during 4Q to further increase the percentage of HQLA securities and adjusted the held to maturity holdings, thus reducing the associated AOCI volatility to our capital under stress. This portfolio rebalancing, including turning over about 10% of the book and is not expected to have a negative impact on further NII growth. Lastly and consistent with our previous announcement, we will resume share repurchases this month and intend to repurchase up to 600 million through June 30, 2019. Turning now to slide 16, I'd like to focus on our 2019 outlook. Before I start though, I'd like to first share some of the assumptions, underlying our current views. At a macro level, we are assuming continued, albeit slowing global growth. Market interest rates forward and only  a modest uplift from equity markets, but with continued volatility, which will keep investor flows muted and transactional activity light. I would note that this operating environment is materially worse today than it was just 45 days ago when I presented at the Goldman Conference. Since then, we've seen a significant selloff in equity markets for the year end 2018 with the US equity indices down almost 10% in December versus the first two months of the fourth quarter. This sell off has put a material drag on our quarterly fee revenue run rate since it is geared off of the 2018 year end step off of AUCA and AUM levels. And over the same period, the rates picture has markedly changed too, with the consensus moving from two Fed hikes in 2019 to nearly none. Amidst this uncertain revenue environment, we will be laser focused on expenses. As you can see in the walk, we believe we can achieve approximately 4% in productivity saves, driven by our larger than usual 2019 expense program, which includes both resource discipline and process re-engineering improvements, partially offset by an approximately 3% of ongoing business and necessary IT investments. This should yield a net 1% reduction in 2019 total underlying cost, aside from the full year effect of CRD and notable items. In addition, given the severe market environment, we currently expect to reduce expenses 2 percentage points from 4Q18 to 1Q19, excluding seasonally deferred compensation via our recent hiring freeze and senior management exits. While material percentage of our revenues informed by markets and not in our control, we can control expenses. We will intervene further if necessary. Turning to fee revenue, with the December market selloff and increased volatility, there is a scenario where 1Q19 total fee revenue could be down quarter-on-quarter by 3 to 4 percentage points, driven by known factors including the market step off, the higher than historical pricing headwinds and the fiscal effects of lumpy revenues in CRD and trading. And because of the year end 2018 step off, even with a modest linear uptick in equity markets during 2019, we could see this 1Q fee revenue as our quarterly run rate for several quarters. At this point, we\u2019re operating the company under this scenario and we see sustained market uplift or further retreat, however, this picture could change. For example, in terms of market sensitivity, a 5 percentage point instantaneous uplift in markets is worth about 25 million per quarter to our servicing fee revenue with a lag of half a quarter. In regards to NII, we expect to see low to mid-single digit growth for the year. For 1Q, we expect a downtick, which would be fully accounted for by two fewer days and the absence of the 4Q episodic hedging benefits I mentioned earlier. Taxes should be in the 15% to 16% range for the year, though we expect 1Q19 to be higher at 18%. And finally, given the balance sheet repositioning undertaken in the fourth quarter, we are optimistic that we are better positioned for the 2019 CCAR process, subject of course to the Federal Reserve scenarios and associated approvals. Depending upon the specific CCAR scenarios, we would expect to target a total payout of over 80% for the upcoming CCAR cycle. Finally to slide 17, in summary, full year 2018 was a mixed year. We had a solid start to the year with record new servicing wins of 1.9 trillion, which reflects our distinct servicing capabilities. Revenues started strong, but we had a difficult second half, given our exposure to weaker equity markets and challenging industry conditions. We continue to distinguish ourselves in FX trading as well as how we've effectively driven NII growth, as we've engaged with clients. All told, EPS increased 22% and ROE increased 1.6 percentage points. On the capital front, we are better positioned for the 2019 CCAR cycle and one of our top priorities is to return substantial capital to shareholders this year. Finally, as I outlined a few moments ago, we are taking immediate action to adjust our expense base for this new revenue environment and we're confident the actions we announced today position us well to reduce our 2019 underlying expense base, relative to last year. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Further comment on the pricing, because I think we all get that the market drops and so fee start out lower. That's, I don't think a surprise at this point. The worst pricing, what I'm curious about is, how it manifests itself, in other words, I think you used the phrase this year, I mean, this year is like 2 weeks old. So are we talking about each new contract that comes up as it comes up and it kind of rolls over like the next five years, I just wanted to get -- understand a little bit more about what's new about the -- because pricing has gone down like the last 30 years straight? Ron O'Hanley: This is Ron. Let me start on that and then Eric will probably want to say something on it. The way pricing works in there or historically has worked in this business and particularly for us since our business is disproportionately for asset managers is that when you reprice, there are some assumptions built in around market and as importantly around flows. I mean, if you serve asset managers, you get the business and then over time it accumulates. We've gone through -- the industry has gone through a very large number of repricings for all the reasons that I've outlined earlier in terms of the pressure that clients are under and those same assumptions, at least on our part have been applied and I assume on everybody else\u2019s part.  We had a year of very sharp down market and as importantly no flows. So between the volume of pricing and the fact that the usual kind of assumptions haven't yet played out, that's what's led to one, our results, particularly towards the latter half of 2018 and second for our outlook. Now, it's obviously -- we have to, as part of the pricing discipline that we've talked about, we\u2019re rethinking these assumptions in terms of market and how much, if at all, to rely on flows, but that's really what we're referring to here. Do you want to add anything? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Glenn, I\u2019ll just add that historically we've seen pricing headwinds for decades in this business, just part of the underlying assumptions or some pricing headwinds offset by flows and activity and market appreciation, as well the structure the contracts are set up and those have historically been in the 1.5% to 2% range. Literally, over the last half decade, we've gone back a decade and we've got that history. We've seen closer to 4% headwinds this year.  And if we think about the coming year, we expect about the same. That said, we've been renegotiating our contracts, right, and extending term. We've been putting in place some clarity around expectations on volumes and market levels and so forth. And while we're a bit more than halfway through those contract negotiations, the negotiations happen, then the fee changes occur and then we actually have to live through that. So we're just a bit below the majority of what we are going to need to live through and that's just part of what we have to navigate.  I will say that the fee headwinds tend to hit a little more in the earlier part of the year than the latter part, just because of the kind of calendarization. And so that's incorporated in our forecast. The net is that, at the end of the day, this is part of our industry. We feel like this is a wave, it's a larger wave than we've seen in the past and -- than usual \u2013 and we think there will be some reversion to the mean. But that said, it strengthens our resolve that we've got to work on expenses. We've got to take expenses out, we've got improved productivity and we've got to adjust our cost structure to be in line with what the revenues are that we can earn. Glenn Schorr : That actually leads to just my other follow-up is, if you could talk about the timing and ramping of, say, both the cost save program, because it's more headcount than comp focused and then also, while we're at it, the timing and ramping of the one, but not yet funded pipeline, because those could be partial offsets as well obviously. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Let me start on the expense side, because that's, I've been putting a lot of my time personally with Ron and the management team on that and I think you saw in my prepared remarks, I gave you a sense of what we expect to do in terms of expenses for the year on an underlying basis, down 1% and because we've been intervening month by month and quarter by quarter, we expect total expense to be down on an underlying basis by about 2 percentage points from 4Q to 1Q. But we're trying to just adjust and that just comes in stepwise the increments.  I think at the same time, there are some ramping of some of the ongoing investments that we need to do and so that's what -- that's what will get the lines to meet at about that 1% down for the year. But, we're trying to peel off expenses, we've got a relatively fixed cost base, so we've got to take it down in steps and at the same time, we got to do it carefully, so that we continue to serve our clients well and deliver the services in the highest quality manner. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, Eric, I was wondering if you could help us flush out the point you made about not run rating CRD? And can you help us understand just what your expected contribution would be, if possible, both on the revenue side for more of a full year \u201819 basis and also on the cost side? I think what you've given us is the underlying on the expense, but it would be helpful if you could give us a sense of how you're thinking about the CRD adds? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Let me describe CRD in a little more detail and I think we provided the fourth quarter P&L here on page 10 of the materials. Think about it this way, revenues have a seasonality in CRD, because of the kind of natural calendarization that happens in sales, in a software oriented business and I think you'll see that in most of the software business that you or some of your colleagues may cover. We disclosed that we -- that the fourth quarter is typically 30% to 35% of full year revenues, that's a rough amount. It will vary a bit, but that's probably at least something to start with and so part of the guidance I gave on total fees for 4Q to 1Q includes the natural downtick that you\u2019d see after that fourth quarter seasonal position. And I think you can kind of build models off of that. In terms of expenses, these are first quarterly expenses, what we are doing in CRD is all the things you'd expect and we've described, right, we're tackling those 80 or 90 engagement -- client engagements. We've begun to build out the sales force further that was part of our intention. We've added and we're adding product engineers for installation, because that tends to be the bottleneck, not just sales, but actually the ability to install and to install in a timely manner. So the expenses for CRD will ramp during the year as we integrate. That's all part of the accretion dilution analysis that -- and commitments we made. And so I think you've got to assume some ramp that would be representative of what you might do, were you to run a software company, where you are trying to effectively double the revenue growth rate, because that is the underlying goal. Remember, the original -- the growth rate in this business historically over the last four or five years has been about 7% top line. The kind of on Charles River synergies should take that through a series of different actions to double that and so we need to invest in the earlier quarters and years to deliver on that. Ken Usdin : And then if I just take that back up to the top of the house, I think the comments you gave us on the fees were on an all-inclusive basis, so if I think about what you just added on the CRD, what's your concept of just -- and I know it's harder, given your opening comments, but just the ability to deliver positive operating leverage and given the tougher market environment and some of the pricing points and how are you going to -- how you're trying to balance that, can you do positive fee operating leverage with this outlook or is it just going to be one of those, hey, we've got to make it through this and then the longer term, we come back to it as the market improves? Eric Aboaf : Ken, it's more the latter to be honest, right. I've been real clear about the change in the market environment just over the last month and a half, right, whether it's equity market levels, whether it's even lower flows, I think, December long term outflows between US and Europe were, just in December were $100 billion negative. Through November of the year, they weren't even $200 billion negative. So this -- and then we have all the geopolitical and macroeconomic and trade questions. And so that makes us feel that we should be conservative and careful in how we run the company. And as a result, I think what we've done here as part of our prepared remarks is be real clear about what we can do and should be doing on expenses. We are -- we think there's a ranges, I think there's a range of scenarios on revenues and what I'd rather do is just give you good visibility into the coming quarter or quarters on revenue as I get that and then a real commitment on the expenses and just be in touch as developments change. Ron O'Hanley: Ken, what I would add to that is that we believe we need to manage the company with this somewhat muted outlook. There's so much uncertainty out there in terms of the macro environment, what it means for markets and what it means for investor flows. Having said that, we continue to be very encouraged by the client activity that we see, some of it Charles River driven, some of it driven simply by our increase in service quality and the drive for clients to think about more consolidation, but we really do understand that those macro effects can actually overwhelm anything that we might do and then I am actually confident we will do on the revenue side, so it makes sense for us to manage the company on the expense basis with that muted outlook. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken of UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just want to try to think about this in the context of the medium term targets that you guys laid out in early December. I believe the targets included a 10% to 15% GAAP EPS and it was my understanding that that was the one medium term metric that actually intended to apply for each year, it would apply to actually 2019. So number one, now that we know what GAAP EPS for \u201818 is at 6.40, I want to make sure that that is still intact and then maybe help me understand how to get there, because to think about adding in CRD operating expenses of 160 and amortization and such to the expense guide that you give in the deck, with net of the cuts you\u2019re making and then also layering in, Eric, your reference to some sustained fee rate pressure, which seems like we had stability in 4Q, but maybe you're indicating that that was -- that's temporary and we should think about some further fee rate pressure from here, so maybe, I might not be thinking about correctly, hopefully you can provide some clarity? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. Let me take that. We made some very clear commitments for the medium term across a series of different financial elements from capital return to reigniting revenue growth, EPS and so forth. I thinks in the last month and a half, as I said in my prepared remarks, the environment has really changed for this year 2019 and whether it's the equity markets off 10%, whether it's long term flows racking, one of the worst months of the last few years, whether it's a geopolitical and economic environment, getting -- taking another step down or sideways, we now think there is a wider range of revenue scenarios than I think we consciously had in mind in early December, as we put up those medium term targets a bit.  So I think from my perspective is we are going to hold to the medium term targets, I think the 2019 year itself is going to be a more challenging one. And at this point, what I\u2019d not like to do is be too optimistic. I think a year ago, in this call, we were a bit too optimistic, as the environment changed and didn't react quickly enough and I think our perspective is, we've got to take a more conservative perspective here and update you as it comes, but I think 2019 will be more challenging than we had expected just a couple of months ago. Brennan Hawken : Good to know that my math isn't totally way off. And then thinking about the deposit cost front for my follow up. You guys continued to show a 50% beta, which is encouraging. Looks like the likelihood of a further rate hike has deteriorated. So, can you walk us through maybe how we should think about deposit cost pressure and your expectations for deposit costs in a 2019, where we don't see further increases in short term rates, could we still continue to see upward pressure on that deposit cost and what are your expectations there. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Brennan. Deposit costs and betas will continue to float upwards. I think we've been, 2 years ago, early on, we were in the 20% range for beta as we moved into the 30% to 35% range for a while. This year, we\u2019re right smack in the middle of the 50%, 55% range and we certainly expect that during the year that will continue to tick up and we've seen that in other firms and so that's inherent in our forecast. We think it will jump up to very, very high levels, not, we don't have any indication that that would be the case and so we just expect to continue grind up our betas and continued modest transition from non-interest bearing into interest bearing. I think one of the things that gives us confidence in the NII outlook of low single digits to mid-single digits is that, just by virtue of the 4Q step off, right, we build off of that during the course of the year, as we've expanded our coverage program, one of the earliest efforts that Ron and I started, I'd say it was probably about a year ago was actually client engagement on deposits, right, the full suite of what they need to do with their cash and that in our minds has actually really solidified the deposit gathering with our clients and gives us some capability to put the right amount of volume of deposits on our balance sheet.  And so what we would like to do this year and obviously subject to ebbs and flows in the market is to not only hold deposits steady, but see if we can drive them up somewhat because that would be part of how we deploy the balance sheet in a positive way. And if we can do that plus get some of that high quality lending that the 40x leverage fund needs or the private equity capital call lending that they need, that would also be a positive. So, there are a couple of different dimensions there that we're working on to drive some growth in this coming year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So I was hoping we can double click on some of the things we talked about here in more detail. So I guess starting with fee pressure, I guess, one, I guess what gives you guys confidence that the pressure will normalize beyond 2019, so sort of why doesn't the 4% annual drag doesn't continue beyond that period? And if you guys could provide a little bit of color in terms of customer segments in particular, client types, geographies, things like that to help us get a better flavor of where the pain points are? Ron O'Hanley: Alex, this is Ron. I think that where I begin on that is that the -- much of the pricing discussions have occurred and started in earnest with the combination of the ongoing pressure on the big active managers or managers in general, but certainly the big active managers, while at the same time, markets were running up and clients were seeing that State Street and [indiscernible] gathering more revenues for doing really the same things. So it led to what we would view as an accelerated amount and a heightened amount of fee discussions. As Eric outlined though, as we've gone into this period, one, we've moved and pretty much insisted upon term for our pricing. So in other words, to make it a little less variable than it's been in the past and second, in most cases, we\u2019ve actually gathered more business as part of the pricing discussion. So the reason why we feel confident that it will abate, it's never going to go away, but that it will abate is, one, as Eric noted I think, we're through about, just over 50% of our clients in terms of discussions on this. A little bit more than that and for the ones that we've done it, we've extended term and gotten more business. So that's why we would feel that this is a bit of a cyclical low here, but feel confident that it should improve. Eric Aboaf : Alex, it\u2019s Eric. I\u2019d just also say that this is obviously a phenomenon that started in the US, the US asset managers were under more pressure sooner and earlier, right, because of the flows of active to passive. We've had now similar discussions in Europe. There we think it's not to be quite as difficult, partly because the kind of the ETF mutual fund differential isn't as sizable, but we'll see. So it's affecting primarily the asset managers as a segment that\u2019s seeing where those are most intense and a little less so some of the other pension or in insurance type companies. That said, we have had run ups in the marketplace and oftentimes, these fee negotiations become more intense after run ups in the marketplace. Why? Because if you just think about yourself being an asset manager, right, you're paying us fees that are scaled to market levels, markets appreciate, you look at your bill, your bill is going up and your natural inclination will be, well, let me go and talk to my bill provider about how can I get some of that back. And so we have seen, as we've gone back for half a decade, a decade or more, some connection between run up in markets followed by more severe adjustments in pricing. And so I think if we get some normalization to kind of more steady growth in markets, we think we'll get some reversion of the mean, whether this 4% level goes back to the 1.5% to 2%, we'll see, whether it goes back to somewhere between them, we'll see and obviously as we see more, we'll share more with you. Alex Blostein : And then my second question was around securities lending, looking at $120 million run rate this quarter, can you help break out what's kind of still enhanced custody versus traditional agency model and again assuming environment stays roughly the same, is this sort of the low at 120 run rate or you guys are still working through how to reposition the enhanced custody business for CCAR? I thought you said earlier in the call that that\u2019s still a bit ongoing, so I'm just trying to get a better sense of what the jumping off point is? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. At this point, the revenues in securities lending are, let\u2019s see, about 120 for the quarter. It's roughly 60-40, 55-45, classic agency lending versus enhanced custody. So it's kind of in that \u2013 and in that range. I think there are two things going on right now in this area and it's really around the agency area. I think we've seen some stability, reasonable stability in enhanced custody. But on the classic agency lending, we've seen some real market, with markets levels falling, you have just assets on -- loans are lower. We've seen de-leveraging by some of the hedge funds who need to borrow.  So there's less demand out there and as a result, spreads have come down as well. And I think the question is, what happens, one question is what happens to market levels and demand in first quarter. And if you remember, we ended December, I think, at close to 10% below S&P levels for October-November. We've had a little bit of a bounce back, but if that persists, we're still likely to have a lower average, highly likely to have a lower average first quarter than fourth quarter and so that's going to create some dampening measures on demand and you still have some hedge funds continue to de-leverage. So there's clearly a market demand element here that makes us feel careful about the 4Q to 1Q and is embedded in my sequential fee guidance.  I think the other part is the counterparty work that we've had to do with CCAR does have more of an effect on sec lending and while I think we've been through most of it, I don't think we've been through all of it in the agency space, which is kind of just a little more than half of sec lending. In FX, I think we've done a terrific job in diversifying counter parties, innovating, doing compression trades, right, the tools are quite vast and the number of counter parties out there are quite significant and the team has really turned on a dime to kind of adjust their processes.  In agency lending, it's much more concentrated business. There is fewer kind of transaction types available to us and so it's something we're working through and need a little bit of time on. That said, I would tell you agency lending and securities lending and enhanced custody continue to be an area of innovation for us. The question is, how can you structure trades in various approaches to actually refine and actually connect counter parties as opposed to always be the intermediary and still earn a fee and effectively add innovation in what's been a historically unchanged marketplace. So more to come on that and we'll certainly talk more over the coming quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Eric, just to follow up on that. Could you give us a sense of, if you ran through your new positioning on last year CCAR, how much it would have changed the results? Ron O'Hanley: I\u2019m chuckling Betsy because that's the question we \u2013 our capital team would like to ask the Fed, right, that's the -- how do the models work. I'd tell you this that on the investment portfolio we and I think the other large banks have done quite a bit of work on the mark to market effect and how the mark to market on the OCI positions could be modeled and we've now got 5, 6, I think we've got 6 or more data points, their data points with changing portfolios.  So, how much is it worth, I think we've got a range of estimates. I think the reason we felt comfortable saying that we're optimistic about our capital position is if you think about it, if we have earnings of what it's been the 2.5 billion, 3 billion a year, we know how much we like to return and we know what every 10 percentage points of those earnings are in terms of capital return and so if 10 percentage points of capital return at $300 million, right, we have some sense for how much you\u2019d have to adjust the mark to market impact to create another 10 percentage points or 20 percentage points of return and that's kind of the math we've done. So I don't really want to be in a position to predict AOCI impacts on our portfolio. We could all do rough estimates, but that's how we've thought about it and that's maybe the kind of the quantitative context I'd share with you. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately, the Fed has talked about proposing CCAR stress tests, it's only run on RWAs and not on leverage ratios, have you thought through what that could mean for you. Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. I think we've done the modeling of that. I think there's been a fair amount of outside in modeling and right now, I think tier 1 leverage is our finding constraint and under the stress test. The difference between a tier 1 leverage binding constraint versus an RWA binding constraint, while it's not perfectly discernable, rough estimates, $1 billion range, maybe a 1.5 billion, but it kind of depends on exactly how the test is run, what the timing is of the various market factors and so forth, but that has some real material benefit and I think we are optimistic that with [indiscernible] having passed and the Fed working on the implementation of that and some of the Vice Chairman\u2019s comments that there is some real movement is just a matter of time and hopefully months, not quarter is when we hear more, but it\u2019s an important positive for us. Betsy Graseck : And then just a little bigger picture, I know you've talked a bit about, if then scenarios on revenues and expenses and I guess I'm just trying to understand if you have a more muted revenue outlook, Ron, maybe you could just give us a sense as to, do you have to invest to get further cost saves or do you feel like there still is opportunity because I know you did a big restructuring here. And I'm just trying to understand, is further potential expense opportunities really incremental or is there more that you can chop? Ron O'Hanley: So what we've done is going after the expenses that one we just should go after and second, what we believe we need to go after, given what you're hearing from us is a cautious outlook going forward. If your question is, is there more to go after, of course there is and we've got -- we've noted a comprehensive program in place that we actually expect to be able to drive more. We also have the work that's been done in the past that I can't emphasize enough in terms of Beacon, the work that's underway in terms of consolidating our delivery and all of our operations and those efforts will continue to pay off in 2019 and beyond. And then finally, to the extent to which we saw an environment that was even worse than the cautious one that you're hearing from us, we'd obviously start to look at things like the pattern of investment. I mean, that's the last thing we'll go after because we do believe that it's important. What we have what we think is a sensible investment program, adjusted to the opportunities and market realities, but if we had to, we\u2019d look at that again too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Maybe I'll just start with expenses and then move on to revenue growth question. So first, just on expenses, just to clarify for 2019. I'm getting basically to about an 8.6 billion core expense run rate and what you exclude from that is the CRD amortization and any CRD acquisition related expenses. But it would also include delivery costs to achieve the revenue synergies that you outlined when you did the deal, which would be some portion of that 180 to 200 and maybe if you can \u2013 Eric, if you can talk about how you're looking at those delivery costs for 2019 and then the trajectory of expenses going into 2020, given that we're potentially guiding down on expenses and saves as the year? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. Let me try to do this from a couple of different directions. I think page 16 of the deck is probably a helpful starting point, because we kind of define the underlying 2018 expenses as you know that\u2019s ex CRD and so forth. And then where we expect those to end at the end of \u201919. I think you do need to take -- put CRD in there. First quarter, scale it up and I think while we will be investing, I'd ask you to think through how quickly can you invest well in a business, right, there's little bit of a bounding limit there and if you're at a $40 million run rate in 4Q, it just -- think about, I think, there's a range, but I think you can quickly come to what's reasonable versus an unreasonable set of expense growth rate off of that level.  So I think you can work off of that. You do have to factor in the intangible amortization, which we've defined there and then the acquisition and restructuring costs will also flow through. I think this quarter is a good example of what a run rate should be on a quarterly basis, but we\u2019ll obviously take those as they come, in line with the actions we\u2019ve take and the appropriate accounting. So those are the pieces, happy to work with you and IR team to take a look at how you're modeling it out and take things from there. Brian Bedell : Okay. We\u2019ll do that offline. And then just on the revenue side, maybe Ron, if you could just characterize how those conversations are going, you mentioned the 98 client engagements with Charles River customers and if you could give some perspective, maybe some refresh perspective on the trajectory of revenue synergies, appreciate that that\u2019s a 2021 goal, but if you could sort of give us a sense of how optimistic you are on winning new business from the game plan of talking with the CRD clients and the concept that you mentioned at the outset of the pressure that asset managers are facing and whether they're very receptive to the partnering concept? Ron O'Hanley: So, let me start with the question on optimism. We're very optimistic about achieving, if not exceeding those revenue synergy goals. The nature of the conversations, let me give you some sense of those. Some of them are simply that the CRD clients, they like the new owner, the new owner is in private equity, so they see stability and there's just more CRD activity happening, more movement from shrink-wrap to cloud, all of which is good from a revenue and profitability perspective from CRD.  There's also a series of client -- a series of client conversations where it may be a State Street client with no CRD presence or a CRD client that sees the value of having more of their activities with State Street and CRD together and the attraction of those of course is a simplification of the internal operations and operating stack and technology stack. And then there's a set of conversations that we, in all honesty, hadn't expected to be having, which is clients, where we either don't serve them now or we serve them in a minimal way or even in a couple of cases where there was a competitive bidding situation and we lost typically for price that are all being looked at again. So it's pervasive, it's comprehensive and it's driven by all these -- all these things we talk about in the marketplace, which are real negatives to short term revenues, but we think are real positives to seeing more business consolidate with us and us having, in the end, a much higher share of the wallet. Brian Bedell : And do you think you can -- based on those conversations achieve those revenue synergies in a potentially linear fashion over the next three years or is it more hockey stick towards 20 and 21? Ron O'Hanley: It's a little bit too early to tell on whether the pattern is going to change, Brian, because these are pretty comprehensive discussions. You try and move them along as fast as you can, but they take time, because you're really talking about a once in a generation change in these firms in terms of how they're going to run their business. So right now, we're sticking to the timeframe, but I would emphasize that we're highly confident in achieving the amount. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mike Carrier : Good morning, so first question. Just on expenses, I guess I want to kind of step away from the expense program and the 350, but just thinking about sort of the core business, maybe like what has been done to make the cost structure maybe more variable, just given some of the uncertainties that you have on the revenue side, some of the pricing trends that you're seeing and basically, if it's -- the revenue is going to be tough to predict, I'm just trying to gauge, when we think about some of the lines like comp, transaction, other, like how much of that is variable that can kind of ebb and flow with the revenue backdrop versus what's fixed or more structural. Eric Aboaf : Mike, it's Eric. Let me start on that one because the nature of our business has actually become, in terms of expenses, more fixed than variable and partly that is, as we automate, as we put more capital work and labor and we need to make that shift be even more dramatic to be honest and, I think, as Ron describes, we feel good about some of the investments we've made in some of the automation, but I don't think we've sufficiently adjusted the stack of labor that we have against it, but our business is actually becoming more fixed than variable over time.  And I think that means two things. I think that means from an expense program and programmatic standpoint, we need to find ways to take out step level, kind of step function expenses off of -- out of our expense base, so as we automate we need to take labor out, as we work with vendors, we need to find ways to adjust downwards, as we get larger and they get larger and we force the scale benefits to accrue to both parties. So that's part of what we just need to do because of the nature of how this business has evolved, relative to where it was as a highly manual, highly variable business, 10, 20, 30 years ago. I think the second perspective that we've developed as a senior team here is because it's more fixed than variable, we actually need to find ways that in good times, we create more margin expansion and more leverage because in truth, while we have an ability to take some step wise and step function reductions in the expenses, in difficult times, it's hard to adjust the level that we would like, given that revenues could move as much as they are moving up or down.  And so I think our historic belief that we should run with operating leverage of maybe a point in good times, I think that's not really something that makes sense as we step back and think about how this business has been operated, it may have made sense in the past, but that's something that we need to change. And so we first need to work through this particular market environment, but that gives you at least some context as to how we're thinking about this going forward as well. Ron O'Hanley: Mike I want to add to Eric's last point there because I think part of the challenge that we're facing now is that in the past, the costs have been too variable, as the business has grown and it's not that there were people have been through it, we had these distributed operations and we just weren't achieving scale benefits as rapidly as we should have, as we could have been. With the work that's been done over the last year, not just Beacon, but this consolidation of our operations into this global delivery group and the creation and running of these hubs, that is the goal is to achieve much better scale benefits and as a consequence, we should be able to deliver what Eric's talking about in terms of in good times, actually more operating leverage than we have in the past. Mike Carrier : And then just a quick follow up. You guys mentioned some of the pricing challenges across most of the asset servicing or asset management industry versus CNF, but when you think about some of the other products, services that you're offering, where are you seeing the areas where you're not seeing maybe the same level of pressure, there's more maybe growth opportunity that you can allocate resources to? Eric Aboaf : Mike, it\u2019s Eric. I think the answer to your question really is around the product stack that we offer. If you think about it, custody for example is the most commoditized of our products. Then there's accounting, then there's funded administration, the prospectus creation, then there is middle office, where I think we've actually gotten to be better about how we and smarter about how we price and operate that business. So as you move up the product stack, I think we see and actually more recently with some of the new SEC reporting requirements and so forth, we've seen more pricing power and I think in fact in terms of something like CRD or software, there's actually effectively inflation escalators in contracts because of the nature of that business and of that industry.  So part of this is kind of where you are in the stack, which actually I think encourages us to continue to pivot and make sure that when we're offering custody, we also do accounting. When we do accounting, we also do administration and so on and so forth. And so that's maybe a little bit of flavor as to where you have strength. I think the other places we have found that where we have clients that are moving in different directions, de-leveraging or what have you and as their books adjust downwards, we have gone back and said, look, we need to adjust pricing accordingly and in particular, in the hedge fund space, that's been an important part of the back and forth.  And then lastly I\u2019d tell you the other place that we're working through as pricing is not only as we have price discussions we asked for more wallet and more share of wallet in a much more rigorous and disciplined manner and controlled manner, we've \u2013 Ron and I have put in place with some of our most senior folks, very rigorous processes there, but we've also had very active discussions about being paid for in different ways, being paid for with more deposits left with us than with some of the other players and that's been another area where I think we've found some ability to be paid appropriately for the service we provide. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a follow up on Eric on your outlook on NII and NIM, if the Fed were to stop, I mean, historically State Street has seen leverage once the Fed stops, as assets reprice and deposit betas typically or deposit repricing has stopped pretty quickly, because you have high deposit betas during rate hikes and then you stop, sounds like, you didn't, I guess, reinforce that view. So has something changed or should we -- how do you think about Fed deposit pricing once the Fed stops and given where your securities portfolio yield is, it\u2019s still well below 2%, 2-year Treasury, should we expect your securities yield to grind a little higher over -- once the Fed stops, so just thoughts on NIM. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Let me tackle it from a couple of different directions. I think if the Fed stops now, there are a couple ways that we will get some incremental growth in NII. First, just get the fourth quarter run rate over the earlier quarters will create a full year back to \u201819 relative to \u201918, that's the first piece. The second piece, as you described is that the investment portfolio tractor continues to work upwards and that's worth, we continue to have investment coupons higher than those that are falling off, it\u2019s a little more complicated for our book, because we operate not only in the US geography, but also the international geography, but there is more there. I think third, there is a continued mixing of the portfolio.  We've historically run with a very large kind of a barbell portfolio of credit and treasuries. I think you've seen in some of the changes that we made, the first quarter of \u201818 and then the fourth quarter of \u201918, you've seen we've shifted into more of agency MBS portfolio that gives us some pickup relative to treasuries and then we've also shifted in the foreign sovereigns, it's -- you can see it directly, but out of some of the sovereign versus some of the supers and also and the other types of global government agencies. So we think there is some amount of grind up work. And then I think, the final one, which in some ways is most connected to the business is how do we continue engaging with our clients on cash and how do we actually find ways to create better solutions for them on cash, right. And I think that's where, it's not only their cash position, but it\u2019s their needs for repo, whether it's direct repo or FIC repo, it\u2019s their money market sweeps and so forth. And so each one of those is a very engaged conversation, to the extent that we can drive some amount of volume growth, we feel like backing follow the bottom line and that will just, we can just report on as we see developments. Jim Mitchell : And on the deposit pricing point, do the prices go up still despite no rate hikes? Eric Aboaf : No. I think you get a little bit of the tail end of December, flowing through the first quarter, but you get some relative stability in deposit pricing I think. I think on a direct basis, I think the question is how much competition is there out there in a flat rate environment, I think what happens is what happens to the competition for deposits in the banking system and while we don't directly compete, there is always some spillover effect and so if we get a situation where lending grows relatively quickly for a time period, back to the 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% range and banks need to fund that lending with deposits and there's more deposit competition, then you can see pricing, then you can see pricing go in the favor of clients and against the favor of the banks. I don't think we see that at this point, but we're always watching carefully. Jim Mitchell : And then as a follow up question, just on your revenue, fee revenue forecast, can you just for our modeling purposes, help us understand what market levels you're kind of assuming, I see that in the footnote, you talk about 5% growth from December levels, obviously, right now, we\u2019re up 6% to 8% in the US, depending on which index. What are you assuming in your first and second quarters to give us that kind of fee guidance? Eric Aboaf : At this point, what we've done is, we've started off of the December 31st step off with that for the US and for the international markets as well. I'm a little cautious on a particular quarter, so just that's why I gave some guidance on total fees for 1Q. Because the way our pricing works is some of it's geared to the, literally, the month end. Some of it's geared to daily averages, sometimes it's a 2 point average and so there is a mix and so it was not helpful that you get that December 31st print.  And I think the other part that's going on here is flows and client activity matter, right. I think in my remarks, I describes that flows, because the natural course of business on flows and remember we get because of the size of our business in the US and in EMEA for asset managers, we get about a third of the inflows that you see in the industry, we get that in our books and records, right, in our custodial counts. But those kinds of flows and then the client activity or that transactional activity is material. That's historically been worth 2 percentage points of growth over the course of annually, right. And right now, we're not seeing much of that at all and so that's another reason why we are quite cautious on the first quarter and we've added a little bit of wording around that as well. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : A quick question on the market sensitivity that you gave, you mentioned that a 5% uplift is 25 million in servicing fees. So I mean, if you put that relative to what the 2018 revenues are, it's about 1% revenue uptick for the 5% uplift in the markets. So last quarter when you gave that, it was 10% and it gives you a 3% increase, so a 30% pull through rate. This quarter, now, it's down to a 20% pull through rate. So when you finish all these renegotiations that you have ongoing, how does the market sensitivity look when all said and done, I mean, do you expect it to be another step down for market sensitivity from here? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. I think we gave relatively consistent guidance, so the historical guidance that we\u2019ve given in our -- is around 10% change in equity markets is worth about 3 percentage points. So on a base of $5 billion of servicing fees, right, that's about $150 million. I think what I said earlier today in my prepared remarks is that 5 percentage points, about 10 is worth about 25 a quarter, but you lose part of that first quarter, so you get a little more than 75, you get call it 85 to 90. So you're kind of within the range of that 10% and 3%, which would give you $150 million. The other part of that is you get a little bit of sensitivity on management fees that you also have to work through, so we can go through that with the offline, but just trying to give kind of some ranges there, so that you could do a little bit of estimation. Brian Kleinhanzl : Maybe the general assumption is it should be moving lower, as you're trying to fix -- move to more fixed pricing in the asset servicing business. Eric Aboaf : Well, I think -- just to clarify, what's happened in -- on the cost structure is the cost structure has become more fixed and less variable. That's on the cost side. On the pricing side, I don't think we have really seen shifts at pricing and pricing structures at this point. I mean, at this point, we still have pricing, which has asset levels as the basis, we have some pricing that is around transactional fees and we have some pricing that's fixed, but there's still some real variability baked into our pricing and we don't see that pricing structure as having changed in new contracts that we're negotiating now relative to those that we've had it, it\u2019s for the level pricing has been adjusted downward and what we're trying to do in several different ways is put controls around our internal processes on how those are negotiated, what we get for them, not only in terms of servicing fees and markets and the FX and security lending and deposits, but also who's engaged at what level of seniority in those discussions, because those are in some ways the most important discussions that we should be having at the most senior levels in our counterparties. Brian Kleinhanzl : And I just want to clarify one thing on that fee guidance, as you had mentioned. I mean, you were talking about AUM and AUC, right, before you gave the guidance, but I mean you were talking about total fee revenues being down 3% to 4% in the first quarter from fourth quarter, correct? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. That's correct and that just includes all of our fee categories. Correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hey, Ron. I hear what you're saying, you have a new expense program, merger synergies with Charles River, you're increasing intensity, but here's my question. What assurance can you give that savings will be sustainable and what is your new pretax margin target and before answering, here's what\u2019s in my head. State Street said that it achieved all savings from business ops and IT transformation and almost all the savings from Project Beacon and had a target at the start of the decade to improve the pretax margin from 29% in 2010 to 33%. But over this 8 year period, State Street, not only missed its own pretax margin target, but the pretax margin declined from 29% in 2010 to 28% last year.  So while the pretax margin got worse over 8 years, State Street took victory laps on earnings calls, from press releases and its proxy and Ron, I know this is predates you, but still this is a question to what extent is the board looking after shareholder interests, to what extent would State Street apply clawbacks to the prior CEO's pay. Jay, a Grade A person, you've always treated me well, you guys have given me access, but at some point, don't you have to look at the business and say, well, actually, the targets were not met, but again the question is, what assurance can you give that the new potential savings are sustainable? Thank you. Ron O'Hanley: Mike, I'm not going to spend too much time on what happened in the past, but what happened over that decade in terms of regulatory costs and things like that that may or may not have been in the forecasts or presented, but let me talk about going forward and the assurances here. One, there's been a lot of work done and I keep coming back to Beacon, I keep coming back to what we're doing in terms of consolidated operations that we have not realized the full promise from. We need to accelerate that, but this is not something that we're just thinking about, this is actually work that's underway, has been completed and we need to make sure that we realize the benefits from that.  Two, as we were talking about earlier, the business, as revenues have come on in this firm, costs have gone up almost at the same rate. We have not gotten sufficient scale advantages, because of the work that's been done and frankly because of the way we're going to manage the business going forward, we will capture more scale benefits. Three, the board is very involved in this. We've worked with them on our new performance management and accountability system and there's a very, very close tie, more so than ever between pay and performance. And so we've got incentives aligned across the firm, so I am confident that we will deliver on what we've said here and we need to do that because we understand that firstly, just to be in a position, to be able to service the business that we see coming down the road, we have to achieve all this. Secondly, we recognize that while there are certain things we can control, there's a lot of things we can\u2019t such as markets, such as client flows and things like that, so therefore that's why we need to redouble the efforts around there. So in those periods, like a 2018, that we don't see that same kind of fall off. Mike Mayo : And just a follow up, again, from covering State Street for a while and again this predates you, a lot of comments about the success of these prior programs, when business ops and IT transformation was first launched, it talked about improving scale and you think you'd see the scale benefits in the pretax margin, so with your more fresh view, do you say what should investors think about State Street for the past decade, given the success of these programs, but then the bottom line not really changing as much, what's your more fresh perspective? Ron O'Hanley: I point to two things. One is that I don't think that anybody at the beginning of the last decade anticipated the significance of regulatory cost increase and just what that would be. Second, we have been slow to achieve scale. We have not achieved as much scale at the pace that we should have and that's where we've got laser focused right now. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Can you share with us, when you look at your fee revenue for this quarter, let's call it 2.3 billion, you gave us some color on the servicing fee sensitivity to the markets, but out of the total 2.3 billion, how much is at equity related. Ron mentioned that you've got a disproportionate amount of equity customers in your client base, so what would be a good estimate of that number being tied to equity type customers? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, I\u2019m trying to think if we have a quantitative estimate in our disclosure on that. We do disclose the mix of some of the ACAs in our supplement, the mix of equities in for our asset management business and then obviously our sec lending is a heavy equity based underlying business. So I do think that we have higher equity exposure than kind of the servicing industry in aggregate. I don't know that I have an excellent estimate, because remember even when we custody for funds that are multiple asset funds, there is a wide range. If you do turn to page 9 in our financial supplement, you will see that there is one thought of our $31.6 trillion of assets under custody and we described 18 billion of those being equity based.  So I think that's a good indication on the custodial side and then on the asset management side, we also do the equity cut on page 10. So, it's significant, it's in the -- you can see it's in the 55, 60, 60-ish percentage range and so we are somewhat dependent on equity markets. I think that's why, in good times, we need -- we're going to be able to benefit from that, but we also need to make sure that we are heavily \u2013 that we are always careful on expenses and create that scalable cost base, so that we don't actually add too many costs in good time, so that we can navigate through. But it is certainly part of our business model. Gerard Cassidy : And then to follow up, I think Ron, you touched on the pricing headwinds historically or maybe Eric you brought it up that 1.5% to 2% was something that was common, but it looked like in 2018, it bumped up to 4%, you're looking for something similar in 2019. What's driving that? Is that competitors are just being much more aggressive and they're willing to price products at maybe, leaving a loss as just the way of getting the business and maybe cross selling other products, but what do you think has driven it up to doubling what it used to be? Ron O'Hanley: Gerard, I think it's what we said earlier, the amount I heard these clients are on is quite high. So typical asset manager, whether you're large, medium or small. So there's just inordinate pressure coming from the client base with the number one. Number two, this assumption, particularly when you're pricing an asset management client, that there'll be both market and fees that will over time actually make what looks like an entry level price, that takes an entry level price and may look like it's too thin, kind of make it fall over time as flows and market help out. When that assumption goes away, it just lays bare that the price that you had as an initial price on a sustained basis in fact isn't sustainable. So at least for us, can't speak for the obviously rest of the industry, it has caused us to be much more careful about how we think about this. That in addition to getting more term, so that pricing can change overnight, looking at what other products and as Eric talked about earlier, the product stack as you move up from custody becomes -- it tends to be less, it's not price insensitive, but less and less price sensitive or less and less commodity like, if you will. And looking hard at deposits and then as importantly, making sure that we try and get another part of the wallet or some consolidation out of it and in most cases, we're getting some or all of those kinds of things. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to ask a follow-up question on capital return. Last year, in CCAR, you were about 50 basis points short of that stress tier 1 leverage target. Your capital ratios are flat year on year. Eric, you gave a lot of really helpful color, talking about the actions you've taken to improve your CCAR standing. What I'm wondering is if the Fed stress test assumptions are similar to last year, what gives you that confidence that you can achieve an 80% payout target. Is that \u2013 should we view that more as a medium term target or do you think you can get there in the upcoming tests? Eric Aboaf : It's Eric. We're optimistic about this upcoming task where there's no certainty on it. So, but we're optimistic. I think we're optimistic for two reasons that we have under control and then there's one that we don't, right. The two that we do have are under our control are number one, the shape of the investment portfolio and if you remember, we made adjustments in the first quarter of last year, where we saw the results and how those played through in to CCAR, so we had a good understanding of the kind of the change this and then results in that and then we made some more adjustments to the fourth quarter of this year based on some of those learnings and the other six data points we've had over the last year. The second one is because of the way we've now better understood the counterparty stress test that the Fed runs, right, we've actively intervened in terms of how we actually structure and limit our counterparty exposures across our businesses, whether that's in FX, whether that\u2019s in securities lending and so we've made very conscious choices, some of which have impacted revenue and you've seen that in particular in sec lending to actually adjust our exposure levels. Now, we're trying to transact with our best clients as much as we used to before, but in some cases, we've had to be more calibrated. So we have literally, if we -- if you go down to the trading floor and the risk management team, they\u2019ve literally had new parameters that they've installed that we've been operating at since late summer and early fall.  So both of those give us some confidence that we can -- that we should be able to do better this year. The obvious unknown is the test itself, right, there's the macroeconomic shock, what's in that. There is global market trading bookshop, which has the counterparty piece to it. And then it's everything else in the test, including assumptions for balance sheet growth and so forth. And on those areas, we don't have any new information obviously won't until we see some of that in late this month or early next month and then we see the test come through in June. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just one more follow up for me on capital optimization efforts, you continue to have a significant amount of preferred in your capital stack, certainly well in excess of many of your peers. I was hoping you could speak to your capacity or appetite to maybe redeem some of those preferreds and how we could possibly think about the timing of redemptions and the associated savings? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. I think the way I would describe the capital stack is the capital stack is proportioned relative to how the current rules are written and implemented through CCAR, where the leverage ratios matter and so there's obviously an importance of having press in the stack. If that were to change, we'd obviously reconsider and so that would give us an opportunity to call or to adjust the alternative tier 1 component, which is the press. I do think though as we go into CCAR, our first priority is to return capital to our common equity holders, right. We're quite conscious of the -- of some of our dealer activity in our issuances this past year and we feel like the first priority is to get capital back to our common equity holders, as we go through the CCAR process this year. Steven Chubak : And just one quick follow up relating to that common equity remark, just given the Fed\u2019s willingness to greenlight payouts, north of 100%, the fact that they've clearly indicated that they're to have this binary pass fail outcome, given the context that you're having all the changes that you've made to reposition yourself ahead of CCAR, would you actually look in the near term and maybe exceed that 80% in order to more aggressively mitigate the dilution impact from CRD? Eric Aboaf : We have said that we'd like to and we're optimistic that we can do better than 80%, so that's exactly the intention and intention and hope that we have and I'll just be clear that there is some of both that's necessary for that, but that is what we'd like to be able to deliver this year and we believe we've made some of the adjustments necessary at our end of the -- that are under our own control to effectuate that. So we're -- we'd like to be able to deliver on that, that would be our intention, given what we've -- how we're proceeding. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Geoffrey Elliott : On the fee income guide, just to be clear first of all, the 3% to 4% down points to about 2.2 billion and then annualizing that, we kind of get to an annual run rate of about 8.8, if that was sustained, is that right? Eric Aboaf : Yes, it's Eric. That's right. I mean, that's where we're trying to start with where we are today and we're trying to adjust for the markets, the flows, the limited amount of client transaction activity and then you have the lumpiness from trading, from 4Q to 1Q, right. So, we always want to be careful and appropriately conservative there. And then there's just the 606 effects of Charles River. So we\u2019ve tried to factor all that in to our estimates. And then we've said that, that's a good run rate for several quarters, we'd like that to be just a quarter or two, not very long, but we're trying to be careful here and to be honest, we're trying to be careful about revenues, because we think if we're doing that, then we're going to be even more effective and adroit in interventions on expenses and we think that's what we should demand of ourselves and what you would all expect of us. I think the scenarios on revenue though are very wide to be honest, because there is a range of different market assumptions, flow assumptions and underlying transaction activity. We just have some -- we just have a little more visibility into the first quarter, including the usual adjustments on market flows, macroeconomics and a little bit of pricing, which tends to be a little deeper in the first quarter than the out quarters, just the way the calendar works and so we're just trying to factor that in, but off of that base, I think there's a range of scenarios and we'd obviously like to see more positive ones and if we see those, we've got to set a conference schedule set up in February and March and in May, we'll certainly update for changes. Geoffrey Elliott : It sounds like in the sort of market assumptions that you're showing on slide 16, that could be a run rate that sticks around for a couple of quarters. Is that fair? I just want to make sure that we're understanding it right. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. That could be the case and that's what we're calibrating our expense we\u2019re up to. Operator : Next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Morgan Stanley, I\u2019m sorry, JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. This is Vivek. Thanks. A couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, Eric, on CRD, the operating margin obviously in Q4, because of FAS 606 is a little bit inflated, what, on a full year basis, what would you guide us to as a sort of a more normalized operating margin, before you put in any cost savings or anything else? Eric Aboaf : Vivek, I think we disclosed back in July an operating margin for that business at around 50% on the old ASC basis. I think the way the current year adjusts a bit, you might get for going from 605 to 606, just given the pattern of how -- what they've, how they've done the accounting historically versus now, you get a small uptick in margin from there. I think then the modeling becomes -- has probably two facets going in. One is the investments that we're making in the business and then the revenue ramp up, relative to those investments and that will tend to trend the margin rate down a bit, as we, in the early year, to building the business. Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right, because while you cautioned us on not annualizing the revenues, I\u2019m presuming the costs we can analyze, if we have modeling out CRD separately, right? Yeah. Okay. Different question. You called out in your NIM, one-time benefits from hedging activities, can you quantify that and is how much of that in the fourth quarter? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. In the fourth quarter, it was about $6 million roughly and a little bit comes from some of the dislocation being swap markets, we've taken our swap positions down over the year as you know, but there's always some dislocations towards the, obviously over the holiday season in particular towards the end of the quarter. So we saw a little bit of that. And it was a positive dislocation, because of how the currencies between euro and some of the -- and yen actually played through, so that was a positive. And then on long term debt, you get a little bit of this mark to market adjustment in the underlying accounting as you got rates and credit spreads move a little bit, so about 6 bucks and it will just, which won't reappear in the first quarter. Vivek Juneja : Can I sneak in another one, which as you combined an accounting with FX and brokerage, I know a lot of -- part of brokerage used to have electronic FX trading, the rest of it, things like transition management, have they just diminished to a smaller base or has something else changed? Eric Aboaf : No. I think what we're trying to do is literally simplify the disclosure and if we did something that took helpful materials away, we can certainly revisit, but we had a line that was historically called total trading services, which is both our direct foreign exchange trading plus our, what I'll call, electronic foreign exchange venues. Those were in what was called brokerage and then some of the other kind of fun connect, like our money market, electronic venue, a little bit of transition management and a few other smaller items like portfolio solutions. So we've just, I think, relabeled that total FX trading services, just to give it the kind of the description that's appropriate. I think within that, I'm just scanning through, about 80% percent of those revenues are foreign exchange related, the rest tend to be a little bit of the money market or portfolio solutions type activity. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's call and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you.",

Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks Ilene and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 3, you will see we announced our first quarter financial results this morning. Our results reflect challenging industry conditions including lower average equity market levels relative to 1Q 2018, continued pricing pressure, and lower global industry flows that were somewhat improved from 4Q 2018 but muted compared to the last few years. In light of the current environment, we are driving a culture of execution and productivity as evidenced by the early accomplishments of our expense management program, which I will discuss further shortly. Assets under custody and administration increased 3% relative to the end of fourth quarter of 2018 to $32.6 trillion with new wins in the quarter of $120 billion and assets yet to be installed of $309 billion. At Global Advisors assets under management increased by 12% relative to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 to $2.8 trillion supported by higher period end equity market values and net new inflows of over $70 billion. Turning to slide 4 and before diving a bit deeper on the quarter, I would remind you that our vision is to be the leading asset servicer, asset manager, and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Let me provide a check-in on the progress against the strategic execution priorities underlying this vision which you have heard me outline previously. These priorities are; first, to reignite our servicing fee growth; second, to innovate and grow diversified revenue streams; third, to deploy the industry's leading front-to-back asset servicing platform as a technology-driven scale provider; fourth, to generate substantial expense saves; and fifth, to foster a high-performing and leaner organization focused on execution and productivity. We recognize that industry servicing fee revenue remains under pressure. However, we are taking a multipronged approach to reigniting servicing fee growth and are confident in our ability to grow revenue which we expect to see in a few quarters. Let me mention some of the actions we have underway. First, we are significantly upgrading our client coverage model. Our new client executive program is approximately two-thirds of the way complete led by a combination of new talent and accountable executives. It will deliver a cohesive one State Street experience to our most important clients, which account for more than 50% of our revenue. Second, we have established a new executive deal review committee. This group is evaluating client pricing and business acceptance decisions that have firm-wide applications. And third, we are strategically aligning the company with the most attractive plant segments in the market our fastest-growing large clients, which include global asset managers, asset owners, and insurance firms. We are changing the way we interact with clients renewing our focus on delivering industry-leading client service and innovative new offerings, while driving efficiencies for State Street. In keeping with this proactive approach, I personally have been working with our client service teams to review client account plans and have met with close to 40 client CEOs in my first 90 days as CEO of State Street. Beyond our largest clients, we are capitalizing on our learnings and have plans in place to implement new segment strategies over the next few quarters beginning with the insurance and asset owner segments with the aim of increasing market and wallet share and further diversifying our revenue stream. Next, I would like to concentrate on our priority to deploy the industry's leading front-to-back asset servicing platform. We are already making measurable progress. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately 110 opportunities being actively pursued by our sales teams. Notably, we anticipate announcing a number of client adoptions of the front-to-back platform during 2019 as clients see the strong value proposition enabled by the Charles River State Street combination. We are pleased with the momentum of Charles River's front end offering as evidenced by its strong new bookings and remain confident in achieving our revenue and cost synergy projections announced when we acquired the business last year. Moving on I'd like to discuss our current expense management initiatives. We remain committed to generating expense saves over the medium-term while continuing to invest prudently in our business. Given the challenging operating environment, this past January, we announced an even more ambitious $350 million cost program for 2019 targeting 4% productivity savings driven by resource discipline as well as process reengineering and automation before investing a portion of that in technology including resilience and growth initiatives. To-date, we have already achieved more than 20% of the targeted savings. Disciplined expense management continues to be one of my top priorities. The firm-wide hiring freeze for all non-critical roles outside of CRD that I implemented remains in place. We are now reducing our workforce while structurally compressing the senior management pyramid. These measures have contributed to an overall reduction in underlying expenses by 2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2018. Finally, becoming a higher performing organization is the cornerstone to executing on our vision and successfully achieving our strategic priorities. I am deeply focused on simplifying the organization and ensuring we have the right leadership in order to drive our strategy and achieve results across State Street. To that end I have made a number of changes to our senior management team. Since last December, we have in place a new Chief Operating Officer, a new Head of Global Delivery, a new Head of our Global Clients divisions, as well as a new Head of Global Markets. We also have announced that Francisco Aristeguieta will join State Street and become the CEO for our International business. Francisco is a highly experienced and talented individual who will lead all of our international business activities. These new leaders will drive the change we desire and ensure we have a high probability of executing on our strategic priorities but that will take some time. I'd like to conclude my remarks by highlighting our focus on capital return to our shareholders. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $480 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As we look ahead, we feel that the current repositioning of our balance sheet during 2018 positions us well for CCAR 2019. We remain optimistic that we can achieve a total payout that is substantially better than 80% for this CCAR cycle. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our first quarter 2019 result, I'd like to take a moment on slide five to discuss certain notable items this quarter and how they impacted our financials. On page five we show our GAAP results in the top left panel, as well as certain results ex to notable items on the bottom left panel for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. For 1Q 2019, we recognize a total of $23 million pre-tax and notable items or $0.06 a share, consisting of $9 million of net acquisition and restructuring costs related to Charles River and $14 million of legal and related items. On a period-on-period -- for period-on-period comparisons, recall that we had no notables in 1Q 2018, but did have $321 million pre-tax of notable items equal to $0.64 per share in 4Q 2018. Turning to slide six. We saw a period end AUC/A levels decline 2% year-on-year and increased 3% quarter-on-quarter. AUM levels increased 3% year-on-year and increased 12% quarter-on-quarter. Much of these sequential quarter changes were driven by large double-digit upswings in the end of period global equity markets, which recovered during the first quarter, after closing down sharply in 4Q. Let me remind you, however, that our servicing and management fee revenues are more closely related to daily average market levels. On this basis, global equity markets were down year-on-year and up only slightly quarter-on-quarter. And while we saw a rebound in equity markets recently, the continued economic and market uncertainty has led to lower levels of industry flows and client activity resulting in further headwinds in Q1. Moving to slide seven. Servicing fees were down 12% year-on-year or 10% ex-FX and 3% quarter-on-quarter. During the last year we saw challenging industry conditions persist, as we continue to see the ongoing impact of fee concessions, previously announced client transition, as well as lower client flows and activity and lower global equity markets. We are now executing on a number of initiatives to counterbalance these industry conditions, which we spoke about in February and continue to expand upon. More specifically, we are, number one, rolling out our new client coverage model across a targeted client base. We're focusing on increasing share of wallet given our estimated 35% starting point. Number two, leveraging our CRD client dialogues to drive incremental core servicing fee revenues, something I'll discuss later in my remarks. Number three, concentrating on key market segments like insurance and asset owners where we have a particularly strong proposition to build upon. And number four, realizing the benefits of increasing pricing discipline from our newly formed executive deal review committee, which met five times in Q1 and is currently reviewing approximately 30 transactions. This adds a very senior perspective to our client relationships that has introduced new found pricing rigor, as well as more senior client share of wallet discussions. Given the sales and negotiation cycle, it will take a few quarters until we see these initiatives come through in the P&L. Turning to slide eight. Let me discuss the rest of fee revenues, beginning with management fees. 1Q revenue was down 11% year-on-year, driven by weaker daily average global equity market levels, as well as late 4Q outflows and a product mix shift away from higher fee products. Fees were down 5% quarter-on-quarter, half of which was day count. After a tough December sell off, we saw only a slight sequential lift from the 1% quarter-on-quarter uptake in daily average equity prices. Our asset management business did however see over $70 billion of positive net flows this quarter in the institutional index space and a very nice rebound in cash, which gives us some confidence going into 2Q. FX trading was down 8% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter on lower client volumes and lower-than-average market volatility. Securities finance revenues were down 16% year-on-year, largely reflecting the CCAR related balance sheet repositioning in the second half of 2018 and flattish quarter-on-quarter, as we saw monthly assets and loans dip in December and January and then rebound nicely as clients re-leveraged and new business came in. This bodes well for 2Q. Finally, processing fees and other was up year-on-year, reflecting roughly a $95 million revenue contribution from CRD this quarter, as well as a tax advantaged lease sale and market related adjustments in our asset management employee long-term incentive plan. Moving to slide nine. I wanted to spend some more time talking about CRD, its financial performance and how we're advancing our front-to-back strategy. As you'll see in the top left panel, CRD had another strong quarter in Q1, generating $99 million of revenues on $41 million of operating expenses, resulting in $58 million of pre-tax income. The business also saw $6 million in new client bookings during the quarter. While CRD continues to perform well, I would caution against simply annualizing these 1Q results, given the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue accounting reporting standard. We've also achieved some important milestones this quarter, which we've listed below. These are indicators of success that we've been looking for and we expect more to come. Turning to the upper right panel on this page, we wanted to provide you an update on our active client discussions regarding CRD. As you can see here, our client discussions continue to advance. We're now actively engaging with approximately 110 clients who represent approximately $39 trillion in assets. As we engage, we're finding that some clients are looking for a full front-to-back offering, so that they can benefit by streamlining numerous portfolio management risk, training and compliance systems in their front office and multiple middle and back office systems into one consolidated State Street platform. At the same time, other clients are excited about our powerful interoperable solutions where we actively build automated interface within feeds from our custodial system into leading front office software providers, like Aladdin and Bloomberg. We are committed to both approaches. As anticipated, these client dialogues are resulting in a variety of revenue opportunities and we remain confident in our revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. Turning to slide 10. NII was up 5% year-on-year, while NIM expanded 14 basis points over the same period, both driven by higher U.S. interest rates and disciplined deposit pricing. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, however, and consistent with our expectations, we saw NII decline by 3% and NIM tightened one basis point, as a result of lower client deposits and two fewer days in the quarter. Unpacking our client deposit behavior this quarter, I would note that average total deposits have gently trended lower as our asset manager and asset owner clients are being more discerning. At the same time, we have seen some lumpiness in non-interest bearing balances, which had actually ticked up in 4Q and backed down in 1Q and are now back on their normal multi-year trend line. And as expected, we also saw an upward move in total interest-bearing deposit betas, but the move was consistent with our expectations of steady client behavior, as well as some targeted wholesale deposit gathering initiatives that we consciously initiated. We do have a series of deposit initiatives in flight that should yield growth in the latter half of the year. Now turning to expenses on slide 11. As you're well aware we are extraordinarily focused on managing expenses in this challenging revenue environment and launched a new expense savings program last quarter, designed to generate material and measurable efficiency and productivity gains over the course of this year. I'll start by summarizing our expenses this quarter ex-notables and seasonal expenses so that underlying trends are more readily visible. Year-on-year, our underlying expenses were up 1%, but actually down 2%, excluding CRD. You see that this was a result of a hard work across almost every line of the expense base, comp and benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other. And on a quarter-on-quarter basis, underlying expenses were down nearly 2%. We have bent the cost curve by; number one, implementing a hiring freeze, which has reduced high cost location headcount by 800 in the first quarter, which is 2.5 times the off-boarding rate of 2018; number two, we're almost halfway through the 15% reduction in senior executives; and number three, we've continued to adjust incentive compensation. Now turning to slide 12, you can see how these forceful actions have resulted in a quick start to the 2019 expense savings program. As a reminder, in January we announced an ambitious $350 million expense savings target for this fiscal year, which is more than 4% of our expense base. This includes $160 million that come from resource discipline with the remaining $190 million that come from process reengineering. And we're off to a strong start already achieving approximately $78 million of expense savings, which gives us confidence on delivering the full target amount this year. The resource discipline savings achieved have come primarily from senior management delayering and third-party vendor saves while the process engineering and automation benefits have enabled the reduction in our high-cost location headcount and the ongoing shift to our global hubs. These initiatives yielded a reduction in your company-wide headcount this quarter by approximately 0.5 percentage point, evidenced by the trend chart on the bottom of this page. With this $350 million expense savings program, we can fully fund technology infrastructure and important business growth investments while still delivering a 1% reduction in the total underlying expenses for the year. Moving to slide 13, our capital ratios were relatively consistent quarter-on-quarter with our standardized CET1 at 11.5% and our tier 1 leverage at 7.4%. We resumed common stock repurchases during the first quarter, returning a total of approximately $480 million of capital to shareholders, $300 million of which were share buybacks. As you can see on the left side of the page with the rebalancing of our investment portfolio completed during 4Q 2018, we have continued to increase fixed rate asset so as to limit earnings sensitivity from the downtick in rates. And with these balance sheet and other actions, we believe we are well-positioned for the 2019 CCAR process and are confident we can deliver a total payout ratio substantially above 80% subject to the usual regulatory approvals. Lastly based on recent regularly filings we now anticipate that our 2020 GCIB surcharge will fall from 1.5% to 1%, a development that should provide us with incremental capital management flexibility going forward. Before turning to slide 14, I'd like to cover our 2Q outlook. We expect fee revenues will be flat to up 1% on a sequential quarter basis. At a macro level, we are assuming equity markets consistent with margin levels, which should provide some support to servicing and management fees, net of quarterly pricing pressure and other drivers. We also expect a seasonal uptick in our markets businesses, partially offset by the absence of 1Q gains in processing fees and other. But we also want to be cautious given the low market volatility we're seeing in April year-to-date. In regards to NII for 2Q, we expect to see a decrease of 1% to 2% driven by continued modest rotation out of non-interest bearing deposits into interest bearing and yield curve expectations of lower long rates. In terms of 2Q expenses, we currently expect to see underlying expenses flat to up less than 1% sequentially excluding notable items in first quarter seasonal and deferred comp but driven by merit increases and CRD expansion. That said, we are firmly on track for a full year guidance of underlying expenses down 1%, and we will intervene further if necessary. Taxes should be the same range as this quarter though our full year guidance of 17% of 19% remains. In summary on page 14, 1Q 2019 was a tough quarter as we work to restart fee growth and focus on productivity. The 2% sequential reduction of underlying expenses we achieved 1Q 2019 demonstrated, our ability to manage expenses and achieve the expected net 1% reduction in our underlying full year expenses that we announced earlier this year. As Ron mentioned earlier, we continue to make progress on our strategic priorities. We have undertaken a number of new initiatives to help reignite servicing fee growth while expanding our sales efforts on the back per acquisition of CRD and making real progress on our synergies. We're also seeing productivity saves come through the P&L, evidenced by the $78 million in savings, which is driving down expenses year-on-year across almost all line items and we brought headcount down sequentially. Finally, we resume share repurchase in the first quarter and returned approximately $480 million of capital to shareholders. Given the balance sheet repositioning undertaken this late last year, we're optimistic subject to the usual Federal Reserve approvals that we can deliver a total payout substantially above 80% for the upcoming CCAR cycle. And with that, let me hand the call back over to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] You first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi, good morning everybody. Ron first question for you. I guess, I was hoping to a little bit of a bigger picture. But I was hoping you could compare the fully integrated front-to-back offering of CRD with State Street with your guidance middle and back-office solutions against some of the other platforms. Obviously you guys mentioned Aladdin and Bloomberg. Help us think through the positives and negatives clients need to consider between vertically integrated model of State Street with CRD versus something that's a little bit more open architecture with Aladdin and Bloomberg? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Alex. It's a big question there. Firstly, let me start with your premise in that I don't think it's in either or as we've I think talked about from the beginning, we strongly believe in the need for a front-to-back solution. It's what our clients are demanding as they're trying to deal with the complexity that's built up in their operations and their own cost. They are looking for simplification, which really does drive some kind of a pre-trade to reporting type of solution, recognizing that we're the largest asset servicer for asset managers, and the fact that different clients will want different things and their selling points are different, we've been committed to both a front-to-back platform that as you said if desired by clients could be exclusively State Street products, but at the same time an interoperable and open architecture functioning of that platform driven by data. So, we remain committed to interoperability but ultimately believe that over time what clients will need is something that truly is front-to-back. That it starts, for example, with a single security master file that you're not having to do all sorts of reconciliations along the way. And certainly there are offerings in place that start to get at that, but we do believe that over time that kind of a front-to-back is what will solve clients' issues. Secondly, we are also thinking about this from our own perspective and our own strategic perspective in terms of as we think about where growth will come from and where revenue growth will come from. There's the existing pool of back and middle-office revenues and there's at least as large a pool if not larger of front-office revenues that become available to us to the extent, to which we connect -- we implement this front-to-back solution. And by that, I'm not just talking about order management or risk analytics or those kinds of things but by having this seamless platform, it makes it much easier for example to trade FX, right. To decide what you're going to do in terms of securities lending. So it has benefits for lots of the high margins ancillary revenue offerings that we have. So we step back from it. We're committed to both and the reason why we're committed to both is that the real competition here is not Charles River versus Aladdin or Bloomberg versus Charles River, it's really what most institutions have in place is this plethora of Excel spreadsheets propriety kinds of things a multiplicity of risk analytic tools and it's simplifying that in moving to something that's a more integrated platform. Eric Aboaf : And Alex, it's Eric. I'd just add that from a revenue standpoint when we offer a front-to-back offering, right. We enter and participate in a whole new revenue pool, right. An $8 billion revenue pool in the front office that we can now secure, grow, expand and deliver on. When we offer for other clients who want an interoperable or open architecture system -- a custodian will plug into those front-office systems just like I said in my prepared remarks, whether it's with Aladdin or some of the other front-office providers in that case the custodian doesn't earn materially more in revenues, right. Those revenues are already sitting there in the office system for the front-office provider. So from our perspective the real revenue growth opportunity is to participate on that vertically integrated front-to-back offering, but on the other hand we have clients who want and need that open and interoperable solution and we're delighted to provide that as part of how we work with them, plug-in with them, interface with them as part of what we do as a custodian. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you very much for that. And then the second question Eric for you, just on follow-up around some of the NIR comments you mentioned. So beyond Q2 guidance, I was hoping you can kind of give us some puts and takes as we think about 2019. I know you mentioned growth in deposits in the latter half of the year potentially yielding some positive results, but obviously the interest rate environment has gotten a little worse. So just maybe help us think through the rest of the year on NIR? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think, clearly since January the tone and the market indicators for interest rates has changed right? Back in January, we even thought there was a possibility of an interest rate hike. I think now we're at the front end of the curve now we're talking about the opposite. 10-year rates were in the 275-plus range and now are down 25 basis points, 30 basis points at least. So I think there's a different environment that we find ourselves in. And so as we look out at the year, we think we're going to see a downtick in 2Q. We said -- I said 1% to 2%. I think on a full year basis, we're looking to probably flattish on NII for the full year right? And the way that'll come is that we're going to continue our active efforts to grow our balance sheet. So our investment portfolio will tick-up this quarter. We've got -- our lending business is going to continue to grow. We're going to fund that with some of the initiatives that we're driving on deposits and those together need to offset some of the underlying rotation that we and industry continues to see in deposits from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing. But, I think, we're optimistic we can kind of work through this period of interest rates, but it's clearly a bit different than what we expected at the turn of the year. Alex Blostein : Great. Thanks for all the details on that both questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. First one is on AUC. So it was up, I think as you highlighted 3% quarter-over-quarter. But when we look at historical trends versus what we saw in the markets this quarter it suggested to me that the sequential change should have been higher and maybe even double that. So can you talk about whether or not there were some lost business in the custody side? And what exactly was happening there? It just seems like there was a pretty big dislocation especially versus AUM? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. This quarter we had decouple features working through on the -- on a quarter-on-quarter basis. As you describe the spot equity markets were up. Now remember, we've got a mix of equities, fixed income and alternative assets are not quite as much as say the S&P. We did have also the lingering, probably almost a final piece was on that previously announced transition that we announced last year. And then we had one other middle-office deal, which I'd kind of put in the legacy bucket that was done a long time ago. It was margin-neutral, which doesn't really pay from our standpoint that a client chose to in source and do themselves, and so that had an affect on the quarter end. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then when we think about expenses here, it seems as though the outlook for NII difficult servicing revenue challenging. You guys have laid out the plan to cut expenses and when we look at on a gross basis, it seems pretty solid, but then we're chipping away three quarters of it with reinvestment. So, I guess, my pushback here is to say why not -- what are the thresholds to justify that investment spend? Why not ratchet the bar higher from an IRR perspective for that investment? Why not for self-funding? Why not pick-up the pressure here to try to drive expense growth lower to try to bring down expenses more given how difficult the environment is because it certainly seems as though based on that -- on the AUC side -- and the servicing revenue piece there's just something that's underwhelming here on the revenue side and there -- it seems as though the best place to make up for it is expenses. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Brennan, why don't I start and then Eric, I'm sure will add to it. Firstly, we need to be focused on both in our, but we do know that what we can control more easily is our expenses. So the programs that we announced at the beginning of January is actually an addition to a number of initiatives that we already have underway in terms of continuing to automate our business and continue to make sure the work is being done at the right place, by the right people, at the right time. And that in itself will continue to yield us some expense savings in addition to the program that we announced in early January. In terms of the reinvestments there is a very high bar on this an extremely high bar. We're actually, I mean, if you -- as you do expect there's more demands than what we're willing to fund and what we're willing to fund needs to have a very high bar either in terms of it adds meaningfully to our client value proposition such that we can visibly see the potential for new revenues, lowers our costs, lowers our risk. Much of that reinvestment is in the resilience area which is a heavy focus now not just for ourselves, but for the regulators. So we hear you on this. We're continuing to keep that bar very high, but are also very confident that most if not all of those investments themselves will yield economic improvement for us. Eric? Eric Aboaf : And Brennan, it's Eric. I would just add that we ask ourselves these questions every day right? Because we're trying to navigate through this uncertain environment and we're asking ourselves every day where can we push harder, faster, deeper. And that's part of the management process and that's why you saw us at the very end of the year announce a hiring freeze, take out 15% of the senior executive pyramid, adjust incentive comp, because we know we need to be decisive on some of these areas and will continue to be. And if the -- if our expectations in the top line don't materialize, we're going to have to do more and we're going to have to figure out how and that's just part of, I think, our perspective. I think we do want to balance that there is some need to reinvest in areas like our technology infrastructure and continue to freshen it and make sure that it is second to none out there. And if you think about it, our clients put a lot of stock in what we do and our reputation is our brand as one of the leading custodial -- custodians in the world. And so, we've got to be balanced as well as we think about our position. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, Eric, can I ask you to expand a little bit more on your outlook for fees to be flattish to plus 1% in the second quarter? I think you mentioned the -- obviously, the markets and averages have a really good start. We know about the business wins and we know about seasonality. So can you talk about, I guess, especially the processing and other with the size of that tax gain and then how does CRD trend from here, in terms of just some of the other moving parts, that would only keep it flat to slightly up? I would think that you'd have a better chance of some better growth given the backdrop improvement? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Ken, it's Eric. Let me try kind of in reverse order, because I think it'll help. On processing and other, we had, as I think I described, about 99 -- I'm sorry, $95 million of revenue, which was down from the fourth quarter which we had disclosed. So you can kind of do the comparison and that's just the \u2013 how revenue recognition comes in, in that business. We also had two other factors this quarter. We had a small sale in our LIHTC portfolio. We have LIHTC, we have wind farm tax-advantaged investment, solar, et cetera. There was an opportunity to benefit from an appreciation that we choose to take and that was worth about $7, so maybe worth calling out. I think the other piece that happened in the processing and other lines, it's also where we need to book the mark-to-market adjustments on the underlying trust that support our asset management business, management incentive pools, right? Which are tied to the performance of their funds and that created a positive mark this quarter of just over $10 and a negative mark last quarter, right? Due to the fall in the equity markets of almost $15 million. And so, there is kind of this back and forth going on in processing and other, which we need to account for. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color and context on that line. I think if I go back to the top of the fee schedule, markets will be what they will be in some ways and will be responsive as our clients engage with this. We do expect some seasonal uptick in areas like securities lending and I think we have some confidence there. I think on servicing fees and management fees, we'll get a bit of an uptick from the average daily levels of the global equity markets to help. On the other hand, there is the kind of pricing pressure coming through. And then, I think, we continue to see a -- either a neutral our even a negative contribution for underlying flows and activity, just given the risk off sentiment, the low levels of volatility and those tend to go the other way. So anyway hopefully that's a bit of color as you think about second quarter. Ken Usdin : Yes. And my follow-up on that last point, Eric, would just be, the commentary about flows and low sentiment and activity. Have you seen any change in the underlying? I know the ICI that you show in the press release looks better, but is it just still quiet out there? Or is there a change in just the underlying activity level of the client base in general? And how would you just characterize that? Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Ken, this is Ron. Let me talk about that. I would say that there\u2019s been some improvement in client activity and flows since the fourth quarter, but its way below recent trend. And I think for somewhat obvious reasons, if you think about the amount of uncertainty out there, if you think about Brexit and also if you think about higher interest rates and there being a real alternative. So we did see some improvement in activity, but I think investor confidence remains low and therefore the activity remains muted relative to trend. Eric Aboaf : And, Ken, when you look at the data in a little more detail and you do have it in our press release, to Ron\u2019s point, where you\u2019re seeing it flows into money market funds, into some of the more simpler ETFs, you\u2019re not seeing an underlying active mutual funds, collective funds and that\u2019s probably relatively true both on the institutional and the retail side. So that\u2019s a little bit of a -- what\u2019s driving our carefulness here. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Thanks very much. Just two follow-up questions. I\u2019ll ask them together, because I think it\u2019s easier. But two things you mentioned on the call. One would be, if you could expand a little bit on the series of deposit initiatives that should yield growth in the second half, curious about that. And the other one is a little broader of what things can you do creatively to strategically align with those faster-growing clients like insurance companies and asset owners? Obviously, big clients well broked, curious on what you\u2019re thinking to expand your relationship with them? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it\u2019s Eric. Let me start on deposits and then I think Ron will take the client segment question. On deposits, we\u2019ve had a series of deposit initiatives dating back 18 months or more. I think we\u2019ve seen this gentle trend in clients becoming, I use the word, discerning, right, given the high rate environment and thinking about where they put their fund. And so, we\u2019ve done a lot of work to step back around our share of wallet of their deposits and where they put their cash, right? Think about the cascade. Some of it is on our balance sheet, some of it is on our balance sheet and non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing accounts some of it. We help them sweep to money market funds, some of them we put in repo. Right? There\u2019s a series of different avenues for them. And so, we\u2019ve become increasingly sophisticated, I think, over the last 18, maybe even 24 months, around tactically working with clients, being disciplined on deposit pricing on one hand, on the other hand using pricing functionality and some of those different avenues as places for us to support our clients. So I think to be honest, one of the reasons why we\u2019ve done relatively well in NII and NIM is because we\u2019ve been so practical and tactical and kind of focused on those underlying opportunities. If I build on that, the next round of initiatives with clients builds on this kind of share of wallet information we\u2019ve built up and the kind of the discussions we have with them. And it does a couple of things. It -- we\u2019ve segmented clients more broadly between small, medium large and different characteristics. There are some clients where we may provide some sweep functionality into money market funds that -- where their cash could end up on our balance sheet instead of in sweep accounts and that\u2019s kind of the sort of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at. But it\u2019s for segments and sub-segments of clients and it always has to be worthwhile to our clients and so we\u2019re actively working with a set of segments on that basis. We\u2019re also to be honest doing a little bit of diversification in our deposit base. You saw that in my prepared remarks. I described some wholesale funding that we added, because we wanted diversified set of deposits given the environment and we\u2019ll continue to do that and while that might affect our overall deposit betas, I think what we\u2019re finding is our deposit betas for the underlying client business is relatively stable up through this time. So a series of different initiatives and I think it\u2019s an ongoing part of our business process. But we -- I think we have a good understanding of where and how much and that\u2019s why as clients do become on average, more careful with their deposits, our view is that we should help them, become more careful with us with their deposits and bring more to us and I think there is more there. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Glenn, why don\u2019t I pick up your second question there. As you know State Street\u2019s historic focus and it\u2019s served it well has been on the largest, most sophisticated typically asset managers. And that strategy has served us well. It\u2019s given us capabilities and enabled -- given us capabilities that many don\u2019t have and has enabled us to serve these clients well. What we\u2019re saying is, is that demands for some of those kinds of capabilities that we\u2019ve developed are starting to trickle down into these mainstream asset owner and insurance companies, although let me take them separately. Asset owners, it\u2019s very hard now to find a pension fund that isn\u2019t in some way also an asset manager. Historically, they used to be asset allocators, their needs were simple and the revenue opportunities were relatively modest for them. That\u2019s changing. Some of them are insourcing, sometimes they\u2019re insourcing at the beta end, sometimes are actually insourcing at the very high-end in terms of what they\u2019re doing in privates. So as that sophistication is going up that lends itself to what we do. And we\u2019re taking that offering that we have for the high-end asset manager and tailoring it for those asset owners. Insurance companies are a little bit different. Historically, they have truly bought in an unbundled way, so they\u2019ve separated custody accounting. For example, we are -- we have the number one market share in insurance company accounting, but we\u2019re nowhere near number one in terms of insurance company custody. Again, driven by the need for simplification of their own operations, you\u2019re seeing these things starting to coalesce, so we\u2019re trying to leverage that position we have in accounting to move it into custody and to other services. At the same time, these insurance companies in their quest for yield are becoming more sophisticated in terms of what they\u2019re investing in. So the growth in private credit has given them -- or has created a need for new kinds of custody and accounting for these more elaborate instruments. We\u2019re the number two player in private credit administration and we\u2019re able to leverage that position with these insurance companies. Glenn Schorr : That\u2019s awesome. Thanks for all that color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Michael Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Eric, just a follow-up on the expenses. You reiterated the 1% lower for the year, but you also mentioned the influx bull with the backdrop. So I guess just curious, if you only expect fees to be flat to up 1% in 2Q with the markets rebounding so strong and the net interest income flat for the year, maybe what backdrop would you become maybe more aggressive on reducing the cost base? Because it seems like -- obviously, the markets are rebounded, but the rate backdrop has gotten a bit more challenging since the last call. So just wanted to get your view on what would pull like the expense levers versus the 1% lower? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think Michael we look at a series of different indicators to think through what we should do when. And it\u2019s ultimately a judgment call, but on that longer list is the interest rate environment. Right now we see long rates at 2.40%, 2.50% maybe a touch more, but if they take another discernible step down then we need to reevaluate, same thing if the fed cuts at the front end of the curve. Those are indicators to us that the times are going to be tough and there\u2019s going to be even more of a risk-off environment and that will then mean even less in trading revenues and servicing fees. A downdraft in the equity markets is another one right, if we get a 10% correction and that correction sticks, right? Let\u2019s say we had the December levels. December 31 levels still stick till today, right? That\u2019s another indicator that we\u2019re in a different environment. So I think we\u2019ve seen these cycles before. We\u2019re trying to be careful in navigating small cycle, large cycle secular versus cyclical, but those are the kinds of indicators we\u2019re looking at. And then I think to be honest, on these quarterly calls, we\u2019re going to continue to update our -- confirm or update our guidance on expenses on the conferences that we do during the year. And as that environment adjusts we\u2019ll -- we\u2019re certainly going to keep you well informed of some of our intentions. And I think you\u2019ll see us put the same pressure on ourselves as you are considering, because we wrestle through that every day. And we know we need to deliver at the end of the day earnings and capital back to shareholders. Michael Carrier : All right. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. You both mentioned some of the initiatives in place to improve the growth outlook whether it\u2019s the client coverage teams, the growth in client statements, the price committee. Is the plan, is it working? And when do you expect to start seeing the results? And with that -- because I think the other side of that is some of the pricing negotiations with clients, so maybe an update on just how far along you are now and what that pricing committee like provides in terms of the economic relationship with the clients? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Mike, why don\u2019t I start there? The -- it\u2019s I\u2019ll get to your last point first. In terms of the pricing committee, it\u2019s not that this work wasn\u2019t being done, but it\u2019s being done in a much more intentional way in terms of weighing not just what the fee rate is, but how it gets implemented, to what extent is they\u2019re offsetting new revenues we can gather from the client sometimes consolidation. We\u2019re also very focused on timing, because oftentimes we find ourselves in a spot where the price cuts if you will were occurring well in advance of when new business was coming over. So you\u2019ll start to see the impact of that immediately and sometimes the impact is what we avoided. It\u2019s the dog that didn\u2019t bite, but it\u2019s very important in terms of how we manage the current income statement. In terms of the other, when are we going to see fee growth is I hope you can tell it\u2019s something that we are laser focused on. And there\u2019s a lot of work underway, but these things take time. I would say that the -- with the client executives two-thirds of them are in place, but about half of those new client executives are actually from inside State Street, so they have a little bit of a leg up in terms of familiarity of both with State Street and the clients. So they\u2019re having impact already. The folks from the outside some have started. Some are yet to start. They have a very high quality, so they\u2019ll have impacts. It won\u2019t be just as quick. Over time, they may even have greater impact. But the other thing that we\u2019re focused on is really the \u2013 as we\u2019re driving the sales teams, we\u2019re trying to make sure they take a portfolio approach to this. We\u2019re obviously very interested and as we mentioned earlier have a significant pipeline in terms of front-to-back opportunities, but we also understand and these are major decisions on the part of a client, they take time. The good news about it is once they make the decision, it\u2019s not permanent but it\u2019s a pretty long-term decision because it will be hard to unwind. There\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve talked about that pipeline. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll see several of those actually come to fruition this year. But at the same time, we haven\u2019t lost sight of what our bread and butter is. So if you look at the $120 billion of new business this quarter. And that was classic high-quality new business. 80% of it was competitive. So we won it from somebody else. It\u2019s stuff that can get installed in a reasonable amount of time, certainly for the most part sometime this year. And then lastly, I would focus on we talked about how we\u2019re well on track for our Charles River synergies. The revenue synergies there are things that will have near \u2013 very near-term impacts on us. So a good example of it is, it\u2019s an existing Charles River client, where we\u2019ve now built in functionality where they can do markets business with us where they weren\u2019t doing it before. That has \u2013 easy to install that\u2019s basically flipping a few switches and then as their activity engages that will show on our bottom line. So it\u2019ll \u2013 the point I\u2019m trying to make is it\u2019s a mix of very long-term high-value kinds of business that we\u2019re focused on the core bread-and-butter business, and then finally these Charles River revenue synergies which in the immediate term have been mostly in the markets area. Michael Carrier : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Hello? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. A couple of questions one just digging in on the expense line a little bit. I know you indicated the guide for 2Q flat to up slightly, but then you\u2019ve got the full year guide that stays intact. And I\u2019m just wondering, if you could talk us through a little bit the outlook for 3Q 4Q if the \u2013 because what I\u2019m sensing is that there is a drop-off in the back half of the year. Maybe you could help me understand if that\u2019s right size it and what the drivers are for getting there? Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. I think \u2013 let me frame expenses this way all right? We said down 1% on an underlying basis ex-CRD right because that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s a core expense base of the firm. And on that basis on a year-on-year basis in the first quarter, we were actually down 2%, so I think we\u2019re well on our way to begin to deliver on our down 1% for the year. I think in second quarter, you have the usual. You don\u2019t merits coming through and a little bit of expansion in something like Charles River, but we\u2019ve got saves coming through as well and we\u2019re just trying to offset. I don\u2019t know that those offsets will come every quarter but that\u2019s our intention. So I think we\u2019re off to a good start first quarter on a year-on-year basis and quarter-on-quarter basis. I think if we can hold expenses in the second quarter to the level that I described that\u2019ll be good progress. And then I think third quarter, fourth quarter I\u2019m not giving specific guidance, but I think you can back into that given the kind of 2% down this quarter year-on-year ex-CRD my guide for second quarter. And then I think you can impute the second half of the year and take it from there. Betsy Graseck : Great. Okay. And then maybe we could talk a little bit about the benefit to capital from the G-SIB surcharge going down as well as the eSLR that\u2019s likely to come out from the fed for you guys. Could you give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about managing the balance sheet, optimizing what you do with the callable prefs that might be out there? Eric Aboaf : Yes. The capital there is one that is, I think evolving in a really nice way. I think first, we feel pretty good knock on wood around CCAR and our CCAR potential this year. So more on that in June. I think the development in the CCAR rules though is quite positive for us, right? If the SLR rule goes in as it\u2019s been published in the register that suddenly releases us for the tight constraint on \u2013 through the leverage ratio and depending on how you model it, probably frees up $1 billion, $1.5 billion of capital, which is quite material on our capital base of about $1 billion and I think could \u2013 it\u2019s something that we\u2019d certainly want to actively find ways to return to investors all else equal. I think then if you go forward the G-SIB surcharge down 0.5 points from 1.5% to 1% on our capital base is worth $0.5 billion of capital roughly. Now all that, will intersect with how CCAR is run a year from now or two years from now whether we go to the SCB and so forth. So it\u2019s hard to predict exactly how and when. But I feel like there is certainly $1 billion plus tailwind coming through on capital through these various rule changes and that\u2019s positive. Exactly, how we monetize them first protocol is getting more buybacks or capital directly to our common equity holders. And over time, we\u2019ll also obviously take a look at the rest of the capital stack, but that\u2019s certainly the \u2013 I think the first place to start. Betsy Graseck : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow-up on the asset management side, if I kind of look at the disclosure around AUM across, whether it\u2019s mix across equities fixed income and cash, whether it\u2019s passive versus active it\u2019s pretty \u2013 it\u2019s very similar if not close to being identical to 3Q 2018 levels, but it seems like your guidance on revenues for next quarter it would be quite a bit lower than 3Q. So I\u2019m just trying to unpack maybe what\u2019s going on underneath the surface beyond what you\u2019re disclosing in terms of the fee pressure. Is it just pricing in ETFs? How do we think about the lower-level run rate despite pretty equal AUM? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it\u2019s Eric. There are a couple different factors there that, I think that are \u2013 that are I think flowing through the P&L. And remember, we really have three large asset management businesses within our large complex where we have a cash business, which is quite tied to our sec lending activities and the cash that comes from the assets on loan. And I think you see those assets on loans be lower this year than they were last year as the market has kind of deleveraged and gone into more of a careful structure. And so the follow-on is that there\u2019s less cash for us in our cash business. And that\u2019s important, because that\u2019s historically been a good-yielding product from a fee perspective. I think the -- why we\u2019re confident in a first quarter, second quarter uptick is we\u2019ve seen some real upswings there and some -- and I think that will come back as markets normalize whether they come back and are higher than a year ago, time will tell, and we\u2019ll see as we go through the next couple months. I think the second part of our large asset management business is institutional, where there is an underlying fee pressure. And that\u2019s certainly true as our -- as we provide some of those passive products. Some of that money is flowing out of passive and to be self managed by some of the largest institutions that we\u2019ve historically served around the world. And that\u2019s clearly why we built out that OCIO business and some of the active -- the other active facilities, but there\u2019s a rotation there that is -- that takes time to turn. And I think we\u2019re still in the turning mode and that\u2019s factoring through. ETFs is a -- I think is -- has got a lot of different components. We\u2019re actually quite pleased with the performance of some of our products and some of the channels that we operate in. That low-cost core product is now well on its way to $30 billion, $40 billion of assets under management from a standing start 18 months ago. And that\u2019s where the market is going. And I think the challenge in ETFs is that the market has shifted right to being a highly retail lower-fee product. And so there we are continuing to build out our offering in that space, while also actively driving growth in some of the other areas. High yield is an area of real strength for us. Some of the commodities, like, gold is an area of high strength. And part of what we\u2019re seeing is some of those product areas are in favor or out of favor, and at the same time, we\u2019re working hard on the various channels of distribution, because that\u2019s the other avenue of success there. So I think more to come as we navigate some of the industry shifts in these -- in those three large asset management businesses and we continue to turn that in the right direction. Jim Mitchell : All right. Well, fair enough, but maybe just switching gears on your excess capital comments with the change. It seems like at least last stress test you were constrained as much by other factors besides the SLR. So, just trying to think, is it that you just feel so much more confident given the balance sheet positioning that you\u2019re really constrained in CCAR? Is that a leverage component and that\u2019s going to free-up capital? I\u2019m just want to make sure I understand how much excess capital you think flow actually can be put to work? Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think the -- if you look back at the CCAR not just last year, but the last half decade of CCAR, right? The principal binding constraint for us is the leverage ratio in effect, and how that plays through, right? Because CCAR has those four or five ratios, leverage is one of those and that\u2019s the one in which we hit the -- we have the low point relative to the requirement. So I think what effectively happens with the change in the SLR and the leverage ratio rules is that constraint gets pulled back. And either we end up with exactly -- depending on how it gets written either that our constraint then shifts to that 1 constraint, all right a common equity Tier 1 constraint; or just a much lighter version of a leverage ratio constraint. I think in either case and this is -- it\u2019s hard to be sure until the rules get done and we actually run the stress test and so on and so forth. I think you\u2019ve seen the same modeling that I have seen. That there is a $1 billion plus of capital at stake that will likely be freed up. The question is I think in the details. And I think we\u2019ll see more as the public rulemaking proceeds. As -- we\u2019ll see more as we go through the CCAR results in June. And we\u2019re hopeful that that\u2019s something we can build upon in the second half of the year from a capital return standpoint. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked and answered, but just maybe to come back to the servicing fee line Eric, the guidance on the second quarter of fees flat to up 1%. If we can just maybe unpack the servicing and the asset management side of that. I mean, we do have markets up about 5% to 6% on an average basis, so I assume that would reflects well within your asset management business. But on the servicing side would that imply -- would your guidance imply servicing fees will be flattish or potentially even pressured? And then just to go back for that re-growth of the servicing fees going forward, given the pricing pressure that is persistent versus the new business that you are adding on should we see those fees re-grow in the third quarter significantly? Or do we have pressure for a good part of the year? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it\u2019s Eric. I think let me try to help out in a couple different areas. I think, first, when we said, fee revenues would be flat to up 1%, that\u2019s overall fees, right? So that\u2019s servicing fees, management fees, markets processing and other all added together, right? So I\u2019m trying to give you some broad guidance. And as we know more as the quarter develops, I\u2019m happy to provide a little more detail. So we think of that in aggregate. I was clear that processing and other has a downtick coming, because of some of the events this quarter, and so I think I helped there. I think sec finance is likely to tick up, FX hard to tell given market volatility. And we are, I think, hopeful we\u2019ll see some uptick sequentially on the combination of management and servicing fees, just don\u2019t know how much. I think if you try to work through the underlying math, I think take the S&P. The S&P at March 31, if it just stays at that level through the rest of second quarter, is up roughly 4% on daily average basis versus first quarter. And I\u2019m using my words precisely, just to help you with the math. I think the international indices may not be up that much. And remember, we also have a fixed income base and an alt space and so forth. And so you got to be careful about how much of that you factor in. I think that should provide some positive benefits, but pricing goes the other way and comes in in lumpy manners that we need to see. And then there is the flows and activity. So I think we\u2019re -- we\u2019d like to see -- just like you all we\u2019d like to see some stability if not some uptick in the combination of servicing and management fees. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- the teams on the business side are intensely working on in the sales efforts that -- and the relationship efforts that Ron described are intensely focused on that. And I think we\u2019ll -- we need to take it as it comes. And I think in the interim, we got to be vigilant on expenses, which is why the hiring freeze started in December. It\u2019s still in place. And we\u2019ve got to continue to find ways to drive out costs. And I think we continue to look for more ways, new ways, additional ways because that\u2019s part of what this environment dictates. Q \u2013 Brian Bedell : Yes. That\u2019s fair enough. And then to maybe just the medium-term targets that you have in the appendix, the 10% to 15% EPS growth. I think it\u2019s over three years if I\u2019m not mistaken, if you can clarify that. So that would be 2018 through 2021, but for this year, if we continue to have these revenue headwinds, it looks like at least on a GAAP EPS basis you would most likely be down year-over-year. So just the thought of how you regenerate that EPS growth in the out-years. Is this all from the CRD synergies or from more cost saves I guess? A \u2013 Eric Aboaf : Brian, it\u2019s got to be a broad combination of those actions, right? I mean we\u2019re -- right now we\u2019re living in a different environment than we were in December. On the other hand, as shareholders ourselves and as representatives of what we need to deliver for our shareholders, we know that we need to find ways to drive earnings growth. We need to find ways. And we -- and if that doesn\u2019t come this year, it\u2019s going to come next year. And it\u2019s going to -- got to come the year after that. We got to find ways to return more capital which is why in a slower growth environment or a flat environment that we\u2019re in, we got to find ways to over-deliver on capital. And I think again some of these medium-term targets, we feel confident we should be able to do that and hopefully a good bit more on that front. And at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got to find ways to drive growth in the topline and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, right? Part of the discussion we had on deposits and balance sheet and some of those initiatives part of the client-specific initiatives, on segments, some of the coverage enhancement is all critical to driving that -- to restarting that growth that we need. And the interim, as like -- as Ron said, we got to both drive that growth and take out expenses and operate the firm carefully. Q \u2013 Brian Bedell : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. Thank you. Can you guys share with us -- you talked a bunch about the front-to-back opportunities for you with your clients. And obviously, the Charles River acquisition supports that strategy. How many customers are currently if any have the full front-to-back product set from you folks? And what are some reasonable targets for the end of this year and end of 2020 of how many customers might actually adopt this type of product strategy from you folks? A \u2013 Ron O\u2019Hanley: Gerard, its Ron, I\u2019ll take that. So as we\u2019ve talked about I think from beginning when we first announced the acquisition of Charles River that the front-to-back strategy would be long term. What you\u2019re talking about here when you do this is a fundamental change in the way that the client itself operates. Typically, they\u2019ve got to move off some existing systems. There are typically a panoply of proprietary or small outside things that they have to move off of so these take time. I think that we suggested at -- when we first talked about this that we would expect to start seeing true front-to-back relationships in the 2020 time frame. We\u2019re actually seeing a much faster take-up -- a lot of interest. We report on that every quarter. There\u2019s a 110 active discussions underway. And we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll see more than one occur and get closed and installation beginning this year, but these are massive because they really involve all or most of what a client is doing to move over to our platform. And I say all or most because even if it\u2019s most, it\u2019s still front to back because of the interoperability that I talked about when I was answering Alex\u2019s question at the beginning of the hour here. So that\u2019s how to think about it. It\u2019s occurring. We\u2019re pleased with the pace it\u2019s occurring. The take-up and the interest has been -- we knew it would be there. It\u2019s been better than we anticipated. There\u2019s a lot of people doing a lot of work on this. There\u2019s a lot of discussions underway. And from the team, we\u2019re about one now today. So I think that you\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll be able to be reporting on specific names later this year. Q \u2013 Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then Eric, you touched on in your prepared remarks about the different reasons for the management fee number being impacted with the market conditions and so on. You also identified a mix shift away from higher-margin products by some of your customers. Could you elaborate on that area? A \u2013 Eric Aboaf : Yes Gerard. We\u2019re really seeing the mix shift in two of the three asset management businesses that we operate certainly in ETFs by most, but mostly industry observers would tell you that somewhere between 70%, 80% of the flows into ETFs are now in those low-cost core products. And that\u2019s as opposed to some of the higher-margin products that we\u2019ve historically operated in. And so there is just a shift in the market that\u2019s playing through and our view is we\u2019ve got to compete in both that new low-cost area and also the higher-fee area, but that\u2019s one of the areas where we\u2019re seeing that shift. I think the second one is in institutional. Like all asset managers, we always have some mandates that were priced two, three, four, five, six years ago. And there\u2019s certainly a lot of intense competition on the institutional side and so what we\u2019re seeing is kind of a rotation kind of the back book being priced differently over time from -- in those areas. So some of it is like-to-like product, and that\u2019s something where we need to continue to rebuild our capabilities, whether it\u2019s in fixed income and LTI, whether it\u2019s OCIO, because I think the only way to tackle that is by expanding and introducing some of those other higher fee areas, fee products to offset. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you everybody. I appreciate the insights. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So Eric, why don\u2019t you start-off with a question on capital planning? Just given the strength of the capital position you cited, confidence increasing that payout well above 80%; and the fact that the leverage ratios are expected to be defang, so to speak. Do you anticipate taking some additional capital actions, and specifically retiring some of the higher cost preferred just part of your upcoming submission? Eric Aboaf : Steve, it\u2019s Eric. I think on capital, we\u2019re going to have to think about it in stages, right? So I think as we filed CCAR, at the very beginning of April, we\u2019re still not in a position where we know definitively what\u2019s going to happen to the leverage ratio. That will come later on. So I think in my prepared remarks, and I\u2019ve said consistently that we have confidence in delivering substantially above the 80%. That\u2019s kind of CCAR as we know it today without any rule changes, but that\u2019s because we\u2019ve adjusted our portfolio positions on the investment portfolio. We\u2019ve addressed some of those counterparty topics. And we\u2019ve actually continued to reduce risk, I think in a smart way. So that\u2019s kind of part one. I think part two could be as we see the final legislation come through on leverage ratio that could provide a second opportunity for us on CCAR, but that could be June. It could be July. It could be August. It just takes time, and I think that will be another opportunity. And there\u2019s a third opportunity with the G-SIB surcharge change, but we need to kind of see these play out. And so I think as I think about capital planning, I\u2019m kind of capital planning in phases, so to speak. With CCAR kind of as is as Phase 1, maybe leverage ratio is Phase 2. And -- but not all at the same time. I think then if we go down the path of what part of the capital stack, I think we\u2019d certainly like to start with our common equity holders. I think that\u2019s the most important area for us to return capital to. I think we owe it to our shareholders, and so that\u2019s the first priority. I think we\u2019ll always look at some of the optimizations around prefs and around the rest of the capital stack, and that\u2019ll certainly be in the analysis that we do. And obviously as we get through that analysis and see some of these developments, we\u2019ll certainly refresh our outlook. Steven Chubak : Thanks, Eric. And capital prioritization was quite helpful. Just one follow-up for me on net interest income, a couple of quarters ago, Eric, you challenged the notion that, that balance sheet, excess reserve levels, would ultimately determine the trajectory in deposits, and that we should really focus more on the H.8. And as I look back over the last couple of quarters, H.8 deposits are up about 3%. Your average deposits are down about 3% with more pronounced declines in non-interest bearers. Recognizing that, that\u2019s more of an industry-wide phenomenon, but just with the benefit of hindsight, what factors do you think drove that discrepancy with the H.8? And as we think about the future deposit trajectory, given some of the actions you cited about improving deposit gathering in the back half, are you still confident that that\u2019s a reliable proxy that investors should track? Or how should we think about what\u2019s going to drive that trajectory from here? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. See that\u2019s a very thoughtful set of questions. I think you\u2019ve got to look at a lot of indicators for deposits. And I think in addition to some of the comments that you\u2019re pointing to, I\u2019ve also said consistently that there is a series of different deposit pools out there, right? There are retail deposit pools. There are custodial deposit pools. There are corporate deposit pools. And all three of those, if I simplify just a three, and obviously there are more factor into the H.8 report. And so I think what we\u2019re seeing is an evolution where the institutional clients that we custody an account for becoming increasingly discerning as we operate in a higher rate environment. And they are in some ways probably more discerning than the typical retail client, who\u2019s got less at stake. And I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing play through in the industry. And I think as we see some of the peer reports in the regional banks, we see some of that corporate deposit money under pressure. As we see the peer reports in the custodial banks, we see some of the custodial deposits under pressure, and then our view is we\u2019ve go to navigate through that. I would tell you that I think we have to do and continue to do a lot of work under the surface to perform as well as possible on NII and NIM. And so for example, you saw this quarter our cost of funds on interest-bearing deposits tick-up, which on aggregate got to a beta of about 80%. And part of that is some of those wholesale deposits that we brought in, because that kind of mixes up as we diversify the deposit base. But I\u2019d tell you the underlying beta for the kind of client deposits away from some of those wholesale sources, was closer to being in the mid-50% betas. And so those betas are I think stable. And so I think we continue to believe that you\u2019ve got to be incredibly detailed and nuanced in your pricing and in your activities and in your segmentation of deposits. And that\u2019s the way to perform as well as possible hopefully outperform some of the industry trends, but I think the backdrop as we now see it is that deposits in aggregate seem to be lightening in the custodial space, not by a lot, but by a bit. And our job is to do everything we can to secure as many of those deposits as we can bring on our balance sheet, and keep with us and serve. And that\u2019s why you heard about some of those initiatives that I mentioned earlier. Steven Chubak : Very helpful color. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. In the appendix you highlight a desire to improve the pre-tax margin by 2 percentage points over the medium-term, over -- where do you define medium-term? And that 200 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin is off of what base? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Mike, it\u2019s Eric. We set those targets out in December. Medium-term, we defined as three years, so 2019, 2020, 2021. And it was off of a base of about 28% margins. And as you can tell, we\u2019ve got work to do. We\u2019re not shy about that. We\u2019re not defensive about that. We\u2019re -- we\u2019ve got real work to do. And part of that is margins are affected negatively when you see a downdraft in revenues. So that\u2019s on us. We\u2019ve got to turn-around that performance. Notwithstanding, that the market has not been conducive, but that\u2019s not a -- that\u2019s -- that just is, and we\u2019ve got to overcome that. And we\u2019ve got to keep taking I think sizable action on expenses. So, we\u2019re highly focused on it. I think it will take some time to get there. But our view is we\u2019ve got to keep acting given the hand that we have and work towards those targets. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Q \u2013 Marty Mosby : Thanks. Eric, I wanted to ask a little bit about, your assumptions that you\u2019ve built into the deposit base. I mean now that the fed has kind of flattened out, is there some tail or conservatism that this trend kind of continues for a couple more quarters which maybe you can see the stabilization of that? And then also wanted to ask you about, your plans for the investment portfolio, and what you could see in being able to take advantage of still taking a little bit more maybe different risk but -- and also taking advantage of higher rates that you have out there right now? A \u2013 Eric Aboaf : Marty, it\u2019s Eric. I think Fed watching is an art and a popular one at that. I don\u2019t know how to be either conservative or optimistic about the Fed. I think at the end of the day they\u2019re quite clear and relatively transparent that there\u2019s not much of an intention to change short-end rates. I think the market is estimating there is more downside than upside to rates but we\u2019ll see. The Fed has been I think pretty clear that it\u2019s kind of steady as she goes. I think the underlying question if that\u2019s the case is how does the economy play out towards the second half and the end of this year. And then is there a hike or a cut a year from now or around the turn of the year? And then, I think there\u2019s a second question because it\u2019ll come through more quickly in the markets. It\u2019s based on the market\u2019s interpretation what they might do and other indicators what\u2019s going to happen in the long end of the rates. And do they fall from here? Do they stay at this level or is there some inkling of ticking up? And I think the optimists might say for a bank that upticks would be nice. And I think we\u2019re just -- our view is you can\u2019t plan for that. You got to plan for the base case being kind of where we are today. Anyways, hopefully that\u2019s -- at least gives you a sense for what we\u2019re thinking. I think on the investment portfolio, our view is that we should continue to put more of our cash to work. We\u2019ve got a very significant kind of cash base on our books, which mean we can deploy that cash into other areas. We\u2019ve got $50 billion of cash at the various central banks. And that\u2019s -- some of that can be put towards high-quality liquid assets. I think what you\u2019ve seen us do over the course of the last quarter, is continue to leg into a larger MBS portfolio as opposed to a treasury portfolio. That comes with some OAS spread opportunities and I think helps balance out the downdraft in rates. And I think you\u2019ll see us continue in a very kind of high-quality liquid asset way, look for opportunities whether it\u2019s in agency MBS, whether it\u2019s some of the supras find opportunities. And continue to mix this portfolio in the right way. I think we\u2019ve got a -- we have a nice allocation to treasuries, but I think treasuries we can thin down a bit as long as we stay in other agency products. And that transition should help us at least to offset the lower rates that we\u2019re seeing today than we had at the beginning of the year. And I think the question is how much of that we can do. And obviously that\u2019s supplemented for our abilities to grow the -- what is a smaller lending portfolio relative to the investment portfolio, but that\u2019s kind of the other avenue of field that we can work towards. Q \u2013 Marty Mosby : And then, just revisiting the capital issue in a different way, if you look at above 80%, and then, assume that you don\u2019t want to go above 100%, how much do you need for organic growth if you kind of assume that your kind of -- and just without -- everything else status quo you kind of keep the ratios kind of migrating out and stability. So how much -- this between 80% and 100% do you need some portion of that for organic growth? And then, that $1 billion-or-about in excess that would get freed up and SLR gets changed, would you have to wait till the whole next year or would you see a -- the ability of significant change like that being able to expedite in-year type of change in the plan? A \u2013 Eric Aboaf : I think in the -- if you think about the SLR, I think you know and you\u2019ve seen banks do the annual CCAR ask which is submitted in April and comes through in June but there is other -- the way the rules are set up there\u2019s always an opportunity if we have -- if we were to have excess capital to go back. And ask the Fed and through that prescribed process for additional asks. I\u2019m not -- and I think we don\u2019t have plans right now to do that all right? We don\u2019t have information to say that there\u2019s more capital but I think you\u2019ve seen banks do that. And we\u2019d certainly consider that if we had some legislative rule changes. So, I think there is an opportunity there. We -- just as I said earlier in my comments we\u2019re going to take this in stages. First, get through CCAR in June. And then, just see if there are other changes coming. Q \u2013 Marty Mosby : So then how much do you need in growth organic growth out of that between 80% and 100%? A \u2013 Eric Aboaf : Yeah. I think that\u2019s a very interesting question right now. Because as we operate in I\u2019ll call it a flatter balance sheet environment, right with deposits more stable than up, then we actually don\u2019t need to accrete capital in the balance sheet in line with that -- with what would traditionally be a balance sheet expansion. And I think in some ways that\u2019s what I like so much about our business. It\u2019s a capital-light business. It doesn\u2019t require a lot of capital accretion. How much it\u2019s -- how much is directly proportional to balance sheet growth? If there is let\u2019s say a year where there\u2019s no balance sheet growth? Then the answer is you don\u2019t need to accrete any capital and retain it on the balance sheet. You can actually return it to shareholders. And so, I think we can take each year as it comes. And I think the kind of total balance sheet growth rate when it\u2019s flat, for example, is capital light in a sense. And can let us really I think reward our shareholders as they\u2019d like to be rewarded. Q \u2013 Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. This does conclude today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you all. Thanks for your interest. And we look forward to further conversation.",

Ilene Fiszel Bieler : Thank you, operator. Good morning. Thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CEO, Ron O\u2019Hanley, will speak first; then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2019 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterward we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 3, you will have seen we announced our second quarter financial results this morning, reporting second quarter EPS and ROE of $1.42 and 10.1% respectively. Relative to the year ago period, our results reflect challenging industry conditions, including client pricing, global industry outflows and volatile interest rates, as well as weaker international average market levels. When compared to the first quarter, our results stabilized somewhat and were supported by market tailwinds within our asset servicing and investment management businesses as well as a slight seasonal uptick within our markets business. Assets under custody and administration reached $32.8 trillion and we are encouraged by strong new wins in the quarter of $390 billion with assets yet to be installed at $575 billion. At Global Advisors, assets under management increased by 4% quarter-on-quarter to $2.9 trillion, supported by higher period-end equity market values as well as institutional client wins and cash inflows. At CRD, we are encouraged by our first front-to-back investment service client agreement and six additional exclusive discussions that are in advanced negotiations. At the same time, the pipeline continues to grow as evidenced by another quarter of increasing client engagements. Following our strong performance under the 2019 CCAR stress test, we anticipate increasing our common dividend by 11% in the third quarter, while conducting $2 billion of share repurchases through the second quarter of 2020 as our proactive balance sheet actions in 2018 contributed to our ability to return an increased level of capital to shareholders. We continue to believe our front-to-back strategy positions us well for success in the medium and long term. And while we may currently be seeing some stabilization in servicing fees, we have not yet returned to growth. As such, we will be updating and sharpening our core business strategy as well as conducting a fundamental reassessment of our technology ecosystem. We have established teams to focus on reinvigorating revenue growth, accelerating the simplification of our operations model, and reducing non-personnel expenses. At the same time, we continue to act with urgency on the things we can control while fostering a culture of execution and productivity with reinvigorated attention to delivering industry-leading client service. I believe we are making progress in these areas. For example disciplined expense management continues to be one of my top priorities, the firm-wide hiring freeze for all noncritical roles outside of CRD has been very effective. Year-to-date we have already reduced high-cost location headcount by more than 1,800 staff and expect that as a result of our actions we can increase that number to 2,300 by year-end. Process automation efforts are in full gear, allowing us to decrease headcount while delivering even better service and outcomes for our clients. Furthermore, year-to-date the $350 million expense savings program we announced in January 2019 has already achieved just over $175 million in total year-over-year savings and we are now increasing our targeted expense saves under the program by an additional $50 million to $400 million for 2019. Our focus right now is finding better ways to reignite revenue growth and generate additional expense reductions, while driving sustainable improvements in our operating model. This means addressing and surmounting the wave of asset manager pricing pressure, completing our executive client coverage rollout, using the increased capacity we have achieved for balance sheet optimization to restart growth in securities lending and trading, and leading in alternatives and ETF servicing, where we are second to none. Our vision remains becoming the leading asset servicer, asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers for the world capital. I am confident we are strategically aligning the organization with the fastest-growing and most attractive client segments, but we must continue to find ways to better serve these and all of our clients in a more holistic and scalable way. We have to continue to innovate and by doing so grow more diversified revenue streams. We must continue to reduce complexity across our operating model through increased automation and by simplifying our technology stack, while reengineering our client and organizational processes in order to drive efficiencies, while delivering industry-leading client service. There are a number of areas we are examining, such as leveraging our IT partners to create better technology outcomes at lower cost. We also have an opportunity to leverage process improvements and expertise within our global hubs to drive further efficiencies, while being constantly focused on resource discipline. As we drive these initiatives forward, I and my team will provide strategy and progress updates in the fall, including a reassessment of our technology plans. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Let me start on page 4. On the top-left panel, we show our GAAP results as well as certain results ex notable items and seasonal expenses for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. On the right panel, we summarize notable items, including $12 million pretax or $0.03 per share in 2Q, 2019 of acquisition and restructuring cost, primarily related to Charles River. Turning to slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A levels decline 3% year-on-year and remain flat quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-quarter move in AUC/A was driven by the impact of the previously announced BlackRock transition, partially offset by higher spot market levels. In regards to the BlackRock transition, please note that the 2Q, 2019 saw the departure of approximately $450 billion of fund to fund AUC/A which was part of the previously announced deconversion and had no material revenue impact this quarter. AUM levels increased 7% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to a record $2.9 trillion, driven largely by higher equity market levels and institutional wins. 2Q, 2019 saw inflows of approximately $20 billion, the second sequential quarter of positive flows and were driven by institutional wins and cash. Moving to slide 6. Servicing fees were down 9% year-on-year, but flat quarter-on-quarter. While challenging industry conditions persist the pace of the quarter-over-quarter servicing fee pressure moderated somewhat during 2Q 2019. Unpacking the drivers of 2Q's flat sequential quarter results, we estimate that, market levels were a 1% tailwind, flows and client activity taken together with net new business were a slight positive, while client pricing was less than a 1% headwind. We are pleased that the actions we have taken since late last year are having some impact. These include the rollout of our new client coverage model, which has opened up more shared of wallet opportunities. And our newly formed pricing review committee has strengthened discipline leading us a moderation this quarter which we expect to continue for a couple of quarters. Nevertheless, as Ron mentioned, we are not satisfied with the servicing fee results and recognize that we need to do more to restart fee growth. On the bottom left panel of this page, we added some AUC/A sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture to our servicing fee dynamics. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $390 billion in 2Q, 2019, up significantly on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis, while at the same time, our AUC/A-to-be-installed this past quarter was also up to $575 billion. While we are encouraged by these sales performance indicators, we also know that we need to maintain similar such momentum going forward. I would add that Charles River continues to help drive our investment servicing client dialogues and we are excited about our first agreement to provide front-to-back investment servicing for Lazard Asset Management more on that in a few minutes. Turning to slide 7. Let me discuss the rest of our fee revenues. Beginning with management fees, 2Q revenue was down 5% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing impact to the late 2018 outflows and mix changes away from higher-fee products, partially offset by higher equity market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 5%, driven by higher equity market levels day count and $20 billion of net inflows. FX trading was down 13% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter mainly due to lower market volatility. Securities finance revenues were down 18% year-on-year, largely reflecting the CCAR-related balance sheet optimizations made in the second half of 2018, but up 7% quarter-on-quarter due mainly to seasonal activity. In regards to the CCAR-related business actions taken last year, we've now made some trade structure changes to mitigate the CCAR counterparty limitations and are confident that we are creating room for incremental capacity for growth going forward. Finally, processing fees were up year-on-year, reflecting approximately $86 million in revenue contribution from CRD. Quarter-on-quarter processing fees were down 12%, driven by the absence of prior quarter onetime items and lower revenue recognition in CRD. Moving to slide 8. You'll see in the top left panel a summary of CRD's operating performance in 2Q 2019, generating $91 million of revenues and $46 million of operating expenses, resulting in $45 million of pre-tax income. The business also saw a $31 million in new client bookings during the quarter including significant bookings from our asset management and asset servicing units, which will drive important deal synergies. While CRD continues to perform well, I would remind you that the lumpiness inherited in the 606 revenue reporting standard and to not read across any one quarter's results. Turning to the upper-right panel on this page, we wanted to again provide you an update on our active client discussions. As you can see here, our client discussions continue to advance. We're now actively engaged with approximately 140 clients, representing approximately $40 trillion in assets. As anticipated these dialogues are resulting in a variety of revenue opportunities and we remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. On the bottom two panels of the page we've also listed some of the growth and synergy milestones achieved this quarter. As I mentioned earlier in the call, our new front-to-back agreement with Lazard Asset Management is an important milestone and reflects as a sort of new growth opportunities envisioned when we acquired CRD. We currently have a strong front-to-back pipeline and are currently in exclusive negotiations with several clients and expect more announcements to come. Turning to slide 9, NII was down 7% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter with our NIM declining eight and 16 basis points, respectively. In regards to NII, the decline on a sequential basis was primarily driven by the level of mix for deposit balances as well as our lower long-end rates have resulted in higher than usual MBS premium amortization and lower reinvestment yields. In terms of client deposit behavior this quarter as expected, we continue to see a mix shift out of noninterest-bearing deposits in an amount similar to what we saw the last quarter and much of the quarterly rate in 2018. At the same time we'd note that our average total deposits were up slightly quarter-on-quarter as we saw some lift from our deposit initiatives though some came at higher rates. In terms of our balance sheet priorities going forward, we have a series of additional deposit initiatives underway including efforts to drive diversity of our deposit base and ongoing client share of wallet discussions to drive deposit balance growth. These initiatives supported our average total deposit balances this quarter and we're confident that there are incremental opportunities available going forward. And on the other -- on the earning asset side, we continue to target careful growth in client lending while modestly increasing the size of our investment portfolio. Now, turning to expenses. As Ron emphasized in his remarks, we continue to be laser focused on expense management in this challenging revenue environment. And we're executing on a number of expense initiatives designed to generate durable efficiency and productivity gains every year. On slide 10, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter ex notable and seasonal items, so that the underlying trends are readily visible. Year-on-year, our underlying expenses excluding notable items and seasonally deferred compensation were up 2% but down 1% excluding CRD and flat quarter-on-quarter. As you can see this result was again achieved across almost every major line of the expense base with information systems and communications where we continue to make technology infrastructure investments effectively the only expense line that saw a material growth ex CRD. The hiring fees implemented earlier this year combined with the ongoing reduction in our senior ranks has also resulted in two consecutive quarters of total headcount declines with our total headcount down 1% quarter-on-quarter and 2% year-to-date. We are now harnessing the benefits of previous automation initiatives across more and more operational processes while we deliver higher and higher service quality. Moving to slide 11. We are pleased with how we turned the corner on expenses over the last year. And to provide more color on where we've realized expense reductions to date and where we see incremental opportunities going forward. Starting with the stacked bar chart on the left, we've provided a few of our underlying expenses categorized by IT, operations, as well as business segments and corporate functions. As you can see due to our cost management efforts for 2019, we expect to achieve year-on-year expense declines in two of these three segments with significant efficiencies realized in operations as well as reductions in our business and corporate functions. That said, the growth in our IT cost is currently too high. And as Ron mentioned we have embarked on a top-to-bottom review of our technology cost structure. We see an opportunity to intervene on our technology infrastructure costs while investing in core business functionality and continuing to invest in resiliency. Turning to the right-hand side of the page with the various resource discipline and process reengineering initiatives we have underway, we expect to continue to see headcount come down over the coming quarters and believe that we can further reduce our high cost location headcount by an additional 800 beyond our target to a total of approximately 2,300 in 2019 albeit while delivering quality service as we automate processes. We are committed to simplifying our operations and technology model. We currently support an application intense IT architecture, which we need to consolidate with a goal of driving cost reduction including an initial rationalization of 10% of our applications globally by the end of this year. But we believe there is more that we can do. We are now ruthlessly assessing every development program against straight payback criteria while investing in client functionality. Taken together, we now see our 2019 expense plan yielding an additional $50 million savings by the end of 2019, totaling $400 million for the year and resulting in a 1.5% reduction in our underlying expense base year-on-year excluding notable items and CRD as compared to the 1% target identified earlier this year. Moving to slide 12. Our capital ratios were again largely consistent quarter-on-quarter with our standardized CET1 sitting at 11.4% and our Tier 1 leverage at 7.6%. We returned a total of approximately $475 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, $300 million of which were share buybacks under our remaining authorization from the last CCAR cycle. On the left side of the page, you can see that we consciously rebalanced our investment portfolio in 4Q 2018 and we're now holding a relatively higher percentage of HQLA, which has created significant CCAR-stressed capital capacity. As you are aware, we are pleased with our 2019 CCAR results released last month and expect to increase our dividend to $0.52 per share beginning third quarter and to repurchase an incremental $2 billion of common stock through 2Q 2020, thus delivering on our priority to significantly increase capital return to our shareholders. I would note that we are confident in our capital position. And as proposed changes the leverage ratio rules are finalized, we anticipate sharing a more fulsome perspective on our capital position and any associated optimizations opportunities going forward. Before turning to slide 13, I would like to cover our third quarter outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, we expect servicing fees will be flattish and management fees will be up low single-digit. This assumes current equity index levels. While market revenues are always difficult to forecast, we currently expect them to take a seasonal step-down quarter-over-quarter given the summer months, similar to what we experienced last year. Processing fees and others is expected to be down sequentially, but still within our quarterly guidance of $70 million to $80 million ex-CRD with CRD expected to be in the low 80s. In regards to NII, given the expectation of lower long rates continued rotation of deposits into interest-bearing and two rate cuts we currently expect sequential quarter NII to be down 1% to 3%. And turning to expenses, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be flat on a sequential quarter basis including the CRD build. Finally, we expect to see the tax rate between 19% to 20% similar to our year-to-date tax rate. Moving to our summary on page 13. While we remain unsatisfied with our revenue performance, we did see some moderation in servicing fee headwinds that helped result in flat total fee revenues quarter-on-quarter. Moreover, the underlying expense reduction we've achieved to date demonstrates our ability to further bend the cost curve, as we've now reduced headcount 2% year-to-date, while also raising this year's expense savings target to $400 million. And we achieved a non-objection to our 2019 CCAR submission and we'll be able to deliver on our priority of increasing capital return to shareholders. Finally, as Ron noted in his opening remarks, we'll be providing updates on our current business strategy and the results of our technology reassessment. We look forward to coming back to you in the fall with our progress. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, Ron and Eric. How are you guys doing? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, thanks Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Just wanted to start out with the NII guide. Eric, thanks for providing that. But, just curious about what beta is embedded. I believe you referenced that did reflect two Fed fund cuts in the back half of the year. And so, how should we think about your expectations for beta that's embedded in there? And how should we think about what you are assuming for overall balance sheet growth and -- I know you referenced continued -- I think you referenced continued non-interest-bearing rotation, but about just overall that deposit balance growth? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Thanks, Brennan. Let me give you the kind of the components and maybe some direction on each one of them. Because as you know, the NII -- the direction of NII is dependent on several different features that we've been working through both as an industry and as a bank. So first, we do expect continued rotation of net interest -- non-interest-bearing into interest-bearing deposits that is expected to continue and we'll wait to some extent on NII. We're seeing long rates down relative to where they were this past quarter where they've been over the last couple of years and so is the reinvestment cycles from the investment portfolio you see some downward progression. And in contrast, you also see I think some modest expansion in the asset earning side of the book right investment -- the investment securities balances are up modestly, we're continuing to grow lending in a disciplined manner and those will provide some uptick. When it comes specifically to deposit betas we're almost at an equilibrium point. If you think about it early in the rate cycle, the deposit betas were quite low and so as the Fed raised rates there was a significant tailwind within NII for us and other banks and the betas were in the 10% 20% range. They floated upright to the 40% to 50% range and now 60% to 70% range. And so in effect as the Fed moves 25 basis points up, if it were to do that had it originally anticipated, right there wouldn't have been much uptick in NII. And similarly as it now anticipates and is within our expectations that it actually moves down, the betas are similarly at that higher level. And so deposits rates will naturally come down reasonably quickly for the first move or so. I think what -- and that's I kind of say we're at an equilibrium point with betas effectively covering or being neutral with respect to the Fed rate change. I think what's uncertain is what happens after the first rate change for the second third or other movements and that we've got to see. But anyway hopefully that's enough to give you some color on a second quarter the third quarter basis. And obviously, we'll continue to provide some texture as rates evolve. Brennan Hawken : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then thanks for the update on the expense outlook. It's really encouraging to see some more assertive movements there. When we think about the $8.43 billion that you've provided for operating expenses is that comparable to the $8.27 billion which you previously provided which I believe excluded the CRD expenses? And how much of that lower expectation is in the first half 2019 results as in already reported? And how much is still on to come? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Let me do that in kind of in a fulsome way. So, the progress on the expense program has been I think quite good. We've logged $175 million year-to-date. We are -- and that was out of $350 million that we additionally anticipated and that's why we have a lot of confidence in being able to hit not only that initial target by taking it up -- but taking it up. And I think what we've seen is we've seen a real progress in addressing some of our prior year growth in headcount. And that's effectively what we're reversing because we're growing headcount at 4% to 5% a year for several years. And as a result while we were automating and I think you've finally seen us begin to do in an industrious way is actually now ensure that the automation is actually used it's used consistently in a widespread way. And that is part of what our COO described at one of the recent conferences on how we're scaling the use of the automation tools. And once you do that you actually need fewer people in the mix and you actually deliver even better and higher levels of service and quality because the processes effectively are straight through. On the overall expense guide, for the year, we've done it apples-to-apples relative to 2018. I think Brennan we're quite clear in the footnote that it's -- you see that the underlying expenses are ex notable items and CRD-related expenses. And so if there is some specific question you have versus some other numbers that you've seen just, we can follow-up offline and kind of do this. We can effectively help you all model this with and without CRD if that's helpful for you. But this is on a what I'll describe as a what I think is really an apples-to-apples way to think about the expense base. Brennan Hawken : And then just sorry the last point about how much of that lower expectation is already reported. Is the difference -- is the right way to think about the difference just be $175 million that you've already done versus now the $400 million is the new target therefore you've got $225 million left to go versus your prior expectations? Is it that simple? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Yes that's exactly. Yes and because of the run rate at which we're operating in the second quarter the amount of the I think we're ahead of plan as I've said on some of our headcount changes. For example we had described that we had targeted 1500 reductions in high-class location headcount for the year. We've already gotten to 1800 in just in the first six months so we're ahead of the plan there. And that kind of run rate benefit is what is we feel confident will give us the full year savings of the $400 million. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alex Blostein : Great. Hi. Good morning, everybody. So I was hoping to start with a question around the servicing business. Eric, obviously you mentioned that the pricing pressure you've seen over the last couple of quarters is starting to moderate. Obviously, it's a pretty important sign for investors given the pressures we've seen in that line item. Can we expand on that a little bit? I guess, historically you talked about sort of 2%-ish annual sort of pricing decline for servicing. Sounds like recently it's been running closer to 1% this quarter you expect that to persist for the next couple of quarters. But, are we through the worst of it? How should we think about pricing pressure sort of beyond 2019? In other words like given the changes that you guys might have made is 1% pricing compression kind of the run rate? Or should we think about that normalizing back to 2% or so that we've seen historically? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Alex, this is Ron. Why don't I start and Eric can pick up. I think what we're seeing is as we'd said now for a couple of quarters. We've been in this period of almost extraordinary price pressure. This is a business that's always had a price downturn kind of built into it, and we would expect that kind of secular element to remain. But there's been unusual price pressure really driven by primarily the pressure on the actual asset managers and asset owners themselves, and then looking for some relief through their large providers such as ourselves. Secondarily, I think it was somewhat driven by when you had the big run-up in the markets in 2016 and 2017 and clients would look and see, gee, I just wrote a check to you guys it was 20% more than the check last year, it seems like we have to get some of this back. So what we're saying \u2013 what we're seeing is the moderation of that, what I call that extraordinary price pressure. Part of it is, we've worked our way through many of the clients. We've also gotten some term out of it. But also we've gone about it, we said, we were changing the way we are going about re-pricing and we've done that. That used to be a relatively routine decentralized kind of decision here. And for any individual RM, it might be something that he or she experiences one or two times every couple of years. So we kind of brought that expertise in centrally. We've been reasonably successful in things like extending term and getting more business. And most importantly, matching the price \u2013 any price decrease \u2013 any in-ordinary price decrease we're giving to incremental business coming in as opposed to the price decrease first and the business later. So what I would say kind of from a qualitative basis is you can expect this business to continue to be price competitive and that there will be ongoing price pressure, but that we are seeing moderation in that extraordinary element of re-pricing driven both by the fact that we've accomplished a lot of it already; and secondly our own actions in mitigating the effects of it. Eric Aboaf : And Alex, it's Eric. Let me just add some of the quantitative kind of beacons to that, right? So, the history here is that, this business operated over the last, I'll say decade, with normal fee headwinds of about 1.5% to 2%, so call it 2%, to keep things straightforward. During 2018 that ticked-up to about 4% for the full year, and we saw about \u2013 we expect about 4% this year as well to play through the revenue line. What we're starting to see is that \u2013 and that 4% is effectively a percentage point each quarter, right? Now it comes a little \u2013 it tends to come a little sharper in the first quarter, and then a little lighter in the second, third and fourth quarter. And as we've \u2013 you can imagine devoured our own data client-by-client and area-by-area, what we're starting to see is that sequential amounts of pricing that are hitting us are starting to moderate. And as Ron describes, we're through not only a majority of the discussions, but closer to three quarters of this kind of what I'll describe as an unusual, or larger than usual wave. As that \u2013 those hit the revenue accruals, it feels like the \u2013 the peak quarter was in the \u2013 or the peak time period was towards the end of the first quarter. And we \u2013 our expectation is that this is beginning to normalize back to some level. So we're trying to be quite transparent with you about what we're seeing. We've got some amount of visibility into what will likely happen with fee pressure in the third quarter and fourth quarter, right? Because those are all our large clients, we know where we may have opened negotiations and so forth, and we can tabulate those. And so that's what gives us some confidence that, we're seeing some of \u2013 some signs of moderation here. I think what \u2013 we all want to be careful of this as the 4% year-on-year that we saw last year that we expect this year, the pace of that coming down, we're seeing it start to moderate. Does it come down to 3% year-on-year after being at 4% year-on-year? That's what we'd like to see and we expect to have more visibility into that as we move further in the year. And then, ideally it comes back down to some normalized level. And that's what where we need to -- we'd like to see, but we also need to work forward in finding ways, as Ron described, to balance some of our actions. And, I think, we'll learn more in the coming quarters. Alex Blostein : Go it. Thanks for that. That's pretty clear. Secondly, wanted to follow up on CRD. Looks like the order intake or sort of the new bookings you guys described in the quarter was around $31 million. And I'm just trying to think about how should we think about that flowing through into the model. Does that kind of hit you all in the subsequent quarter or over some period of time? And then, the pipeline around the front-to-back initiatives that you highlighted, obviously, one will be Lazard, but also the ones that haven't hit yet. How should we be thinking about the economics of that pipeline growing? And not sure if you guys could describe it in terms of, like, AUM times the fee rate, or some sort of frame of reference on how we should think about the revenues of that opportunity? Eric Walter : Let me describe it from two different angles, Alex. When we did our diligence on CRD and then decided to pursue the deal and shared that with you, we described that this business was growing at about 7% top line over the last few years. And our expectation is that we should be on the CRD-specific revenue lines be able to double that. And we're quite confident that we've started to get that level of growth in that business. And that's kind of one way to think about what we're beginning to deliver. And part of that, literally, comes from it being owned by a large parent who's been in business for a couple of centuries as opposed to a couple of years and the willingness of clients to sign on. So that's one way to think of it and we've got quite a bit of confidence that we're seeing that kind of lift. I think on a tactical basis, what you saw this quarter and what you'll see in various quarters is the bookings. The bookings are, we describe, on a run rate revenue basis, just to give you a sense for size. Those bookings tend to begin to get implemented and roll through an implementation timeframe of 6, 9, 12 months. So it takes some amount of time. And then, I just remind you that we were clear that the bookings this quarter did have a larger, obviously, spike. And two of those bookings -- I think we're actually pleased it was to our actually internal bookings with -- one with our asset management business, right, where they're now rolling out CRD in substantial portions in operations. And the other one, which is our servicing business, where the CRD systems are effectively replacing an old compliance engine that we used to offer through our custody servicing business. And if you think about it, on one hand, those revenues will be eliminated in consolidation. On the other hand, those revenues actually lead to direct expense synergies, because had we not implemented CRD in such a, I think, fulsome way, we would have been on those legacy platforms on those -- on that patchwork of the 25 systems that we've described for the typical large asset manager. And so we're actually quite pleased that we can effectively lead with our own implementations, which becomes a model, right, for what Charles River can do, because if you can implement Charles River on an asset manager of a couple of trillion dollars of assets over time, right, then it proves its power and effectiveness in a broad range of different scenarios. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks. Question on securities portfolio. I know I'm over generalizing it. But when credit risk assets were super tight, low rates and tight spreads, you made the switch over to some mortgages got unlucky and, who know, rates fell 50 basis points and they prepaid on you. So my question is, now what do you do? You expect some balance growth, you expect some loan growth. What do you do on the asset side as the balance sheet grows? Because the rate and spread picture hasn't changed all that much. Eric Walter : Hey, Glenn, it's Eric. The bankers have always had these challenges. As you have rate cycles going up, there are opportunities as rates come down. The opportunities tend to be fewer then. As rates invert, there's an even different way to operate. So I don't think there are any silver bullets that I would put out there or any other CFO or treasurer would share with you. I think what we technically do in this environment is where we have excess liquidity and we are a liquidity-rich bank we continue to add to the securities portfolio. We do that and effectively on balances. And you've seen our securities portfolio went up a couple of billion dollars this quarter, and we've got capacity to continue to do that in the coming quarters. And that provides some yields and effectively puts some cash to work. We do that selectively in the agency MBS space, or in the very high-grade credit space, or some of the foreign jurisdictions each of those are tactical choices that we'll make depending on the relative value opportunities. And then I think coincident with that the other part of the asset yield part of the book is that we continue to grow our lending franchise. We don't have a large lending franchise by typical bank standards, and we think that's not inappropriate for a custody bank. On the other hand, our capital call financing business, which is a real area of growth and connectivity with our clients, continues to grow at a very attractive pace as the alternative lenders are all out there building bigger and bigger funds, and it's one which operated quite well during the crisis. And so that kind of capital call financing, the 40 Act leverage fund financing all have very good risk-return dynamics. I think we see some opportunities there, but like anyone we want to stick to what we're good at, and what our clients do given where we are in the cycle. So, anyway, hopefully, that's a little bit of a texture at this point on the price. Glenn Schorr : Yes. Thanks. Yes. One last one. The $575 billion of one but not yet funded, can you give any color in terms of what we should think about in terms of timing working its way into the pipeline and impact on fees? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Each one of those is different, it's literally a composite. The largest the wins in there were in the insurance sector. And I think we've talked to you about our becoming more industrious in some of the sub-segments outside of asset managers, where we're already strong, but I don't think we've emphasized our expansion much as we did in the asset manager segment, which has historically been our kind of core. So there's some insurance wins, there's some asset management wins, there's -- it's a pool. It's hard to directly anticipate the exact on-boarding, but it tends to be six months, 12 months, sometimes 15 months, it just takes time. And in a way it works is the simpler stuff can get done, custodies sometimes get done in six months, but more complex accounting or middle office is 12 months to 18 months. So to us it's a sign that we're out there selling and driving client activity. And part of what we know we need to do is we know we need to continue to drive that client activity as a way to restart the revenue growth that we need to deliver to all of you. So we're trying to also be, I think, more transparent of some of the indicators. And that's one of several indicators, but one we thought -- that we've held for that this quarter. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Eric just one follow-up on the -- on balance sheet. Can you just remind us just how faster the securities portfolio repricing? And within -- and where is the duration stand today after some of the recent changes in the investments? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Ken the duration is at about just over 2.5 years, it's been in the 2.5 years to three years, I think for the last few quarters if not the last couple years. The -- and so it kind of tractors in concert with that average duration. I think the other way to think about it and we've tried to be helpful in our disclosures in the Qs and Ks that as you have movements in long rates say the 10-year treasury that comes back and impacts our NII. And I think the rough -- maybe a rough rule of thumb might be for every basis points change in the 10-year rate, that's worth about $1 million a year. So you can multiply that out for 25 basis points what it would be worth or 50, and that's part of the down drift that we've started to see through first and second quarter, and we just need to be sensitive to. So if Fed cuts rates, that's we think -- that will have one impact. If the curve picks up maybe a little steepness as it does that we'll see. That would be constructive if the curve stays flat or inverts that can move around the yield for us and other banks. Ken Usdin : Got it. And then my second question, Eric, you guys had the very successful CCAR result, you burned meaningfully less that than last year, 208 basis points better. So that didn't obviously effect this year's CCAR but you did -- do a good job in boosting as expected buyback. Can you talk about your views on where the plan proposals are on SLR SCB et cetera? And if the results of this year's CCAR might let you be more aggressive looking ahead or on capital returns? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Ken. It's Eric. And let me do this one in stages, because I think as the Fed governors have said there's about 24 different capital metrics that banks operate under and so it has a series of different steps. I think first as you described, we're very pleased with our CCAR results this year. And a lot of that was some of the actions that we took in the investment portfolio. We literally created several billion dollars of room under CCAR and ended up with as we shifted that investment portfolio out of credit. So that was the first stage. And I think what that effectively demonstrate is under a CCAR-type stress, we have room for -- we have room in the capital account. So that's certainly a first step. The second step is then what are the next most important binding capital constraints and what happens if the CCAR downdraft isn't -- the stress isn't the constraint. Then you go back to what are our spot levels of capital ratio. And those spot levels are on that page 12 of our deck. And if you go through the different spot levels, what you will find is that as a custody bank the leverage ratio and specially the supplementary leverage ratio under the spot rules of 5% for the Holdco, 6% for the bank, are what becomes the next most binding capital constraints, and so the assessment then is how much space do we have there. And I think what happens -- what we're now looking at is what happens with some of the Fed changes in the -- and the SLR that have come out of the Congressional bill that's out for comment, those comments I think concluded just a few weeks ago. And now the Feds got to turn that into a rule and based on that and the timing of that rule is certainly that frees up and could free up some capital capacity under SLR. And then after that we go to the next most important binding constraint, is it CET1? What happens with the SCB? What happens with Basel IV and so on and so forth? So think of it as a waterfall. I think why we're optimistic and I described a little bit of that in my prepared remarks is, we've very effectively created room under stress. We think there is a path some more room under the supplementary leverage ratio. And we'll all learn more about that in the coming months or quarter or two. And then what we can do is, we'll go back and think about our capital stack, right. Because we're looking at CET1 opportunities that's one potential pool, you all know that we have about three points of alternative Tier 1 in the form of preferreds, that's another larger than usual pool for banks. But as a custody bank that has been down by the leverage ratios that was important to have at the time. And obviously there is the Tier 2. And so what it effectively does is, I'm trying to give you a bit of a roadmap so to speak how we think about the opportunities but that's the process and then it's around the whole capital stack, and where there are opportunities and that we can -- that we could have appropriately shared back with you and our investors. Ken Usdin : Got it. That\u2019s a lot of color. Thanks, Eric. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Good morning. Betsy Graseck : You dug a lot into the expenses in the trajectory. And I just wanted to understand when I'm thinking about the pretax margin improvement of 200 basis points that you're looking for. How you're thinking about the drivers of that in terms of a little bit bigger picture in the sense of how much of that 200 basis points you're expecting is going to be coming from expenses versus revenues, just given the inputs that you have right now today? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Betsy why don't I start that, I mean, ideally what you would like to see is a little bit of both. But we are cautious enough about the revenue environment that we feel we need to keep doubling down on expenses. We want to do that wisely because we have to do that while continuing to ensure that our client service remains at high levels. And that we are investing in the business. But the way we think about it now particularly given the downdraft that we experienced at the end of last year and the ongoing fee pressure that we've had is that expenses will be the first move in terms of improving that margin and that the revenue actions that we're taking as well as the longer-term revenue that's going to flow in as a result of this front-to-back work, we'll then provide some of that margin uplift later. So conceptually, that's where we think about it. In terms of timing, we're standing by our goals there. But obviously, the world changed a lot from when we put those goals out late last year. So, that's why we've been very cautious with you in terms of really going quarter-to-quarter as we can -- so we can try and get a picture of what's going on the revenue side. And so, we can focus on what we know we can control which is expenses. Eric Aboaf : And Betsy, it's Eric. I would just add that a part of what we're doing is to continue to work through more and more of the expense base. One of the reasons, we shared with you the page on full year expenses in the earnings deck is to actually show you where we are in that process and where we've made more progress and where we feel like there's a lot more opportunity. And I think, you see in particular, as we've automated a lot of more and more of our work and force utilization of some of our automation tools, you see that year-on-year 8% anticipated reduction in operations. And that's exactly what should do as we automate a factory it -- the costs go down and you'd expect that we want to continue that process year after year after year. I think, to some extent, we've made some good headway in our businesses and functions and there's always more we want to do there. But I think we're on a good path relative to the past. And more to come and in those it's really -- its personal expense and its non-personal expense and each one of those has opportunities. And then finally, I think technology cost is the area where we've made a decision more recently and part of it comes as merge operations and technology together under a COO and part of it comes with the realization and a decision here at the top that we can't live given the revenue environment with the kind of technology, cost structure and growth that we've been operating under. And so, that's why we've said top to bottom, we're going to address opportunities, find opportunities and more to come as that review proceeds. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then just Eric, I know we had a conversation earlier about the securities. But we just wanted to round that out with, at this stage, do you see any opportunities for restructuring, securities book positioning or you feel like, where it is right now is optimized for your current rate outlook? Eric Aboaf : Betsy, I think the securities book is in a pretty good position overall. I think we'll always do some adjustments around the margin. Rates are lower. We can always if we wanted get out of some securities and buy back others. So, I think we have some latitude which is convenient, but I think generally, we like the mix now of the securities portfolio. I think selectively and tactically we'll want to maintain duration. We've lost a little bit of duration as we've had rates come down and you have the natural prepayments work their way through. So, we tactically add that back. And then as I said, I think, we want to find ways selectively to expand the securities portfolio because it provides good yields for us at least as a custody bank. And that's part of the -- of some of our anticipated actions. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Mike Carrier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Eric, may be first one, I think you mentioned there's some more balancing capacity for CET1 and I think maybe FX, do you see the demand by clients given some of the repositioning that you did last year. Just -- are you seeing that demand? And how soon could we see some growth in those areas? Eric Aboaf : Mike, the answer is that there is demand out there. There are opportunities for us and I think we have found ways to create capacity. I think the question that comes around the pace of that growth and that takes some time. And I think, part of the reason is, as we implemented some of our constraints and caps that came out of the CCAR counterparty task, in some cases we actually had to reduce activity with some clients or put some constraints on. And as you do that, right clients appropriately say, all right, fine, I understand, but when you then go back to them after having created room and doing some of the diversification of counterparty optimizations and the innovations and I've described some trade structure refinements, those clients are delighted that you're back open for business. But they also come back over time, right? Because it's about then serving them even better than their current providers about shifting where they place their wallet. And so I think it takes quarters to -- for it to build and part of what we\u2019d like to see is that and we'll report on is that build as it comes. It's also a little lumpy because you got the seasonal effects of 2Q and agency lending and enhanced custody and then a seasonal summer months that work the other way in third quarter. But we'll try to provide as much of a window into that evolution. But I think the point we did want to make is that we found ways to create capacity here and so it's a matter of time now for us and for our business teams to execute. Mike Carrier : Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly on the strategy in tech just the reassessment ahead and the update in the fall. Just as that expectation it sounds like it's focused on cost. But I just want to make sure there is that -- anything on like the innovative or growth with partners, just want to make sure you've got any set expectations in terms of what initiatives you guys are thinking and when we'll get an update on? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, Mike its Ron. We\u2019re thinking comprehensively about this, clearly cost is on our mind. But it's also about how do we get to market as rapidly as possible. How do we innovate as rapidly as possible, as tech changes how do we substitute as rapidly as possible? So we're thinking about this comprehensively. And I don't have to tell you that world has changed in tech. And as we have moved our applications to be much more comprehensive and covering the full range of activities from front to back and if you think about our front-office system it's highly -- you're highly focused on the user interface. You think about our back-office system, you're talking about transaction speed and basically invulnerability if you will and high amounts of resiliency. So we haven't really done that kind of broad-based reassessment. It's already started. It's not going to take months, I mean it will take a few months but it's not going to take many months. And we'll come back to you and keep you updated on what we're thinking about. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. Jim Mitchell : Hey good morning. Maybe just -- now that you're close to reality with front-to-back contract with a client. How do we think about the pricing because I think there was concerns initially that you -- that some of the parts would be less than the separate part? So are you seeing is pricing holding up and/or is it -- so is it revenue-accretive margin in terms of the fee rate? Is it -- or is it more margin-accretive because it's more efficient? How do we think about as you build this business the impact on revenue and margin? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yeah Jim, the way I would think about it is that our intention had always been and so far we've been succeeding on this to not let this become just a throw away or an add-on for custody business. And that -- those have actually been pretty easy conversations. And that's actually not what the client is focused on, what the client is focused on here is, how do I simplify my own operations? How do I actually reduce my own cost? And how do I get access to data more quickly and be able to rely on that data? So those have been the key buying factors. I mean certainly there\u2019s a cost element to this but we're not seeing it kind of come back into the CRD used to be priced at X and we want to price it at some fraction of X. The second thing I would point out is, as we had said from the earliest days on CRD and when we rolled out the front-to-back strategy these clients that we're talking to and there's several that are in advanced negotiations, exclusive negotiations there are all sorts of flavors. Some of them are already CRD and State Street clients, so if you will we're putting together the final mile. At the other extreme there is an \u2013 there\u2019s a perspective client in there. We had no relationship with them. I mean, we knew who they were, they knew who we were. But we did not have an existing relationship but they had this need that we've described. So the nature of that will be if it comes to fruition is that we'd expect to see new custody, new accounting and new CRD as a result of that. So there's two elements to your question, one, is kind of pricing, but the second element is what's the content and nature the business? And in some cases we're filling out the wallet if you will. In other cases the wallet is opening up to us for the first time and we're taking the whole thing. Jim Mitchell : Right, okay. That's helpful. And then maybe Eric just pivoting on to deposits. If I look at your queue, a 100 basis point short in shock. It's actually pretty neutral based on disclosures. Is that still the best way to think about it? If you have the long-end staying where it is and we get some cuts, is it pretty neutral to NII? Is that still fair? Eric Aboaf : Jim it's Eric. I think the way we would describe it is that the short-end change of rates in the U.S. in particular is roughly neutral for the first 25 basis points. I think after that, it starts to have a negative impact, right? And why would that be? It's because if the rate -- if rates were to come down 75 a 100 basis points, you start to get compressed against the lower bound on the deposit cost. And so there is a -- the convexity, the stair-step actually matters here. And so that's important to factor in. And then I think the other one is the currency dynamic and we'll continue to add more currency information in some of those disclosures. So you could see what happens if the U.S. moves down. I think there's a big question mark in my mind is that what's going to happen in Europe. And that environment given the change in central bank leadership and some of the other economic growth changes that we're seeing. So anyway, hopefully that gives you some color. I think the first one should be neutral, after that there's, you get back to that more expanded situation that we need to work through. Jim Mitchell : That's fair. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Thanks very much. A lot of my questions are answered. I just have one two-part question on the cost side. Just looking at slide 11 and slide 17 to the cost guidance for 2018 and 2019 on an underlying basis and then looking at that versus the appendix. I see the 8.57 for 2018, but if I add up 1Q 2019 and 2Q 2019 on the same basis, your 8.43 would have imply a 3% increase in the second half on that basis versus the first half. So I just wanted to verify if I am doing the right apples-to-apples there? And then the second part of the question is as we get through the cost saves, shouldn't we be coming into -- in 4Q at a lower endpoint? And as we move into 2020, especially with some of the reengineering ideas you talked about Ron, should we be looking at a lower expense trajectory on a year-over-year basis in 2020 versus 2019? Eric Aboaf : Brian, let me start. I think on the specifics that you just went through, we probably hopefully just cover that as a follow-up. I think that was quite clear that third quarter expenses ex-notable and lumpy items will be well-controlled. And I think you can expect that we like expenses to be either flat or trending down and that'll be the case on a quarterly basis. I do think and it's a little early for us to do our planning for next year, but given the revenue environment, as Ron and I have described, we need to double down on expenses given the -- given our commitments and our intentions to find ways to widen margin and improve ROE. And we do the same kind of things that you're thinking through, which is, what's our run rate at the -- in the third quarter versus the first, what's our run rate in the fourth quarter versus the first. And that's exactly what we should be doing. And why we've been I think pleased that we've gotten our headcount now under much better control. We've gotten some of our off shoring activities to -- at pace, because the second half of the year run rate as a fourth quarter run rate will be more indicative of what we can deliver in next year. And then there's obviously the hard work we need to do as to what can we do over and above that and we always want to find more we can do. And we were industrious this year. We need to be industrious next year. We also need to offset whatever the natural headwinds of merit and so forth. So there's a lots going in that, but we're certainly the same mind that I think you're intimating, which is how do you take advantage of the benefits and do that to -- and how do you tackle expenses year after year after year, because it's an industry in which we need to do that. That's got to be the operating mode that we use. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll follow-up offline on the detail. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is now open. Marty Mosby : Thanks. I had two kind of specific questions. One is, when we talk about the net interest income impact this particular quarter, we're excited at the accelerated premium amortization. When I look at the actual sequential decline of $60 million, there's just not a way for the long-term portfolio to reprice in a normal way to generate that much pressure. So it seems like to me that this premium amortization was a pretty big deal this particular quarter. And sometimes that could be a catch-up. So I'm just curious, how much of the $60 million sequential decline was related to that premium amortization. And then, if rate stay flat, long-term rates, not short-term rates, obviously they would be headed nowhere. But if long-term rates kind of stabilize at their relative position today, what does that mean for that particular amortization number going into the next couple of quarters? Eric Aboaf : Marty it's Eric. Let me first give a little decomposition then we'll talk about the coming quarters. So, the decomposition on a quarter-on-quarter basis was that a little less than half of the $60 million reduction in NII came from the premium amortization a little less than half came from the rotation noninterest-bearing deposits and interest-bearing deposits. And then there was another little stuff from just general reduction in rates and some other more minor impacts. So, that gives you a little bit of color. I think what has happened here and the reason why there was an acceleration is that part of what we did as we rotated out of credit last fall when prevailing long rates were at 3%, 3.10%, 3.15% is we were in some higher coupon bonds. And some of those pay very good rates and as you have the fallen rates you have the acceleration. So, that's what played through. I think some of that is burning out. And so then you get a residual set of bonds at good rates. And so its amount is about working through that. As we look into third quarter, there's a couple of different features happening. There is still some amount of premium amortization that will come through. And so we -- there'll be a bit more in the third quarter and then it begins to tell from there assuming long rates stay where they are. And then what we also have in the third quarter is just the general level of rates and the reinvestment yields and that kind of tractor that I described earlier come through. And so that's playing out as well. The offset to some of that is the some modest growth in the size of the portfolio some modest growth in loans. And that should help and then obviously the deposit dynamics will probably be the larger of the pieces going into the third quarter. What we try to do is kind of knit that together and give you some range of guidance to be able to estimate the -- a bit of the third quarter. Marty Mosby : So, what -- I did hear you say is that $30 million there will be some of that left to come into the third quarter, but by the time we get to the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year, at least, if rates don't decline further, that $30 million negative goes away and NII would get the benefit from that? Eric Aboaf : Yes. It gets a -- it starts to -- exactly it starts to attenuate, right? It gets you have less of it towards the fourth quarter and the first quarter. But remember you always have a certain amount of prepayments floating through a mortgage book that's always been in our numbers. We've always operated with a certain amount. And it could be helpful. There's some good disclosure in the 10-Q on the amount of premium, the premium amortization and we can take you through some of the -- kind of the waves that you should expect for us or for any bank. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then the other very particular thing I wanted to hone in on was in the back end of the fee income you talked about CRD revenue due to revenue recognition standards. Just was curious what you meant by revenue recognition standards? What is that is that? Is that a seasonal thing? Is that a shift that you had a business and now you're understanding it better so you changed the standards I just was curious what that meant? Eric Aboaf : No, that's just it. There was industry-wide change to the accounting. It's I think ASC 605 going to ASC 606, I've got to make sure I double check my acronym. So, I'll do that as a follow-up with our controller. That went into effect I guess about a year and a half ago. And it affects the software-oriented businesses that also affected our management our asset management business. And it's quite prescriptive on how revenue is recognized. And so for fast implementations the revenue is recognized in quite a I'll call it a natural way. But from on-premise installations at the contract renewal point, you literally have to -- that particular quarter of a contract renewal you have to record x percent and we can again get you some of the details of the entire contract. And it ends up with lumpy revenues even though you're effectively providing the service over a period of time. I mean we agree with the accounting literature and it's probably more consistent way to do the revenue recognition accounting for the industry, but it just ends up with lumpiness because of the way contracts are structured. Marty Mosby : And that's not seasonal or anything there's no realm or reason to it it's just going to be how you're onboarding new relationships or different things that are happening within the I guess the actual recognition of that revenue is the activities? Eric Aboaf : Correct. It's the onboarding of new, but it's also the as existing contract cycle through when they -- when the contract renewal state is ends up lumpy and they're not all stacked up in that kind of perfectly even way during the year. So, it will just go up and down. We're just going to we what we want to do is be clear that we -- the underlying revenues, I think we're trying to be clear about the GAAP revenues are the most appropriate \u2013 obviously a way to measure. They'll be lumpy and you just wanted to take over the course of several quarters, or over a year to actually see the numbers in a way that are more intuitive. Marty Mosby : Thanks. And lastly, a bigger picture question. When you all mentioned earlier that the pricing pressure accelerated, which have started to make sense it started to really become much more crystal-clear. In other words, market valuations are gone up so much over the last decade that as you price to those market valuations, that are really not increasing the activities, or work that you're doing for customer, and your customers are getting under pressure. So their revenues per assets under management are going down. They're going to kind of turn to you, and say, well look you're not really doing that much more work for us, but yeah, we've paying you that much more. I think you mentioned the 20% price increase the kind \u2013 just as a \u2013 just kind of a example. So, is there any thought or process where you could get away from being per assets where market valuation would kind of roll around versus being tied more to transactions and activities and more like a cash management type of relationship where you pay for processing versus paying for the amount that you have, which is dictated by market valuations. In the past, it made a lot of sense, because they got revenue on their assets so they could pay you on their asset, but that relationship is kind of busting up. So I just don't know, historically versus going forward, is there a way to disconnect from the market valuation and the AUM and get to transaction processing? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Marty, it's Eric. You're \u2013 either all the \u2013 you're absolutely spot on in describing how this pricing has evolved in this industry. And I think we're having \u2013 we've got as a result broader and broader fee structures with our clients to make sure that there is a mix of flows and client activity and transactions which directly represents the kind of work we do. I think what keeps some of the history going, is that our large clients or the large asset managers and those large asset managers often get paid on a management fee basis, right? If you think about a mutual fund, which is market dependent. So there's a bit of an interest in our clients tying their expenses to market level just like their fees are. We ideally like obviously charge for the service itself as you described. And so I think over time, there will be an evolution, but there is a range of interest here. And I think our view is, we just need to make sure, we're appropriately creating value for our clients. So that they \u2013 so that we can remunerate it appropriately. We find ways to do it in a way that \u2013 the more stable the better. And so those are the kinds of some of those areas that you described are the areas that we've been engaging on. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Just one from me. Looking at the management fee line you mentioned again the shift towards the lower fee products. I was wondering \u2013 hoping to get some color on the velocity of that shift. Is that a trend that's been accelerating or decelerating in any discernable way? And then how do you think about that velocity going forward? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yeah. Rob, this is Ron. I think that, it's certainly something we're trying to manage and we're having some return on that effort here. So this year, for example, half of the new business SSGA has brought in has been outside of the traditional passive area, where we've seen the most price pressure. And we've \u2013 we applaud that kind of diversification. The realities are though in terms of where the flows are going. So if you look for example at ETF flows, we had a \u2013 at the top level, I would describe it as a so-so quarter. But that was driven by continued market share gains in Europe and in low cost offset by really outflows in some of the big institutional products like spy. So this is \u2013 there's clearly a market shift going on particularly in ETFs, and you would find the same by the way, if you looked at some of our large ETF competitors. And where their flows are going, the preponderance is going, to these low-cost products as \u2013 and really what's behind that is a substitute for a higher cost, whether it's mutual funds and typically it's advisers that are employing these as building blocks. So we have to live with that. And that's why we have to, one, make sure we reduce our cost; and two, that we're opening up our distribution channels, so that we are continuing to gain share in those areas. Rob Wildhack : Thanks, Ron, really helpful. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning. Ron, you mentioned about the competitive forces that many of your customers are under, which has led to pricing challenges for you and your peers. Can you just share with us your insights about the competition amongst the custody banks; especially some of the New York banks seem to be stepping up their intensity in competing in this business, because they've got diversified revenue source and this is an area that may be was not as much of the focus five years ago, but it seems to be today. But I'm interested in the competitive dynamics of your competitors and the pressure that puts on pricing. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Gerard. If you look at the history of the universal banks in the space, it's been cyclical. There've been times where they're all in and there have been times when the business has languished. And I would say this is one of those periods in the cycle where they have been focused on it. That is one of the things that drove us to re-examine our strategy a year, year-and-a-half ago. And to make the move that we did, rather than be forced into a position where we're all combating for the same back office stuff, that we wanted to make sure that we had the full range of back, middle and front office and to be able to offer a really integrated offering to them. It changes the nature of the relationship; it changes the nature of the pricing discussion, even changes what the objective function is. I mean, if a client's out there is just building -- bidding out custody, it's not the custody, it's a commodity. There certainly are service differences, but it really is more price. If a client is having or a prospective client is having a discussion with you on front to back, it's really about the next 10 years of their firm. And how are they going to build their firm in a way that they're going to be able to scale, that they're going to be able to manage their economics that they're going to be able to have better access to data to be able to : one, provide better investment outcomes; but two, better services their clients. And we're the only ones that are in position to be able to do that. We're the only custody bank that has those services front to back. So we think we're having just a very different set of conversations. It doesn't mean we don't respect them. Our competitors are good. To survive this long in the asset-servicing space, it means that they you are good, but that's why it was important for us to differentiate our offering. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And as a follow-up, for a number of years State Street and even some of your competitors have talked about an ongoing expense savings programs, improving technology, obviously, it's underway right now at State Street. Is there anyway that we, as outsiders, can measure how successful the integration of technology is into your day-to-day operations? Or can you create a metric, I don't know, if it's is the percentage of actions taken by humans versus robots and technology, to show us the evolution and the success you could achieve by becoming more focused on technology in the mundane day-to-day operations? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. I mean, it's certainly something that we think about, because these operations are large complex far-flung. The two that come to my mind that we focus on a lot is, just the percentage of processes that are straight through, that are truly straight through that we go from beginning to end without any kind of human intervention or some kind of manual handoff. And then the second one, we're -- the second closely watched number for us is the number of robotic applications. And robots in this kind of a transaction processing industry is very different than the reports you might see in a manufacturing environment. What you're really talking about is sub-segments of tasks that then get replaced by the robot and then linking those together. And so, that\u2019s an area where we've done a lot of work on it. We've done the preparation and now we've got to actually install the robots. We've got hundreds of robots installed, but you should expect to see thousands, if not, tens of thousands of those installed from us in the fullness of time. And we should think about -- I don't know that we've talked about or even thought about what we would disclose externally, which -- it's a good question for us to think about. Eric Walter : And, Gerard, if I might just add that on the metrics, there's a suite of metrics that we need, if you think about the straight through processing on equity trades, basically near a 100. Derivative is much more complex. And so part of what -- as this industry has had explosive growth in volumes, right? We need to always be at the forefront of what are the right metrics, what are the right suite of metrics. And those shift, because that's a way we can manage better and I don't think we've always done that as an industry. And let's us better communicate to all of you. So we'll think about the right suite of metrics. And then I'd say that the other metric that really matters at the end of the day is, can we get our cost down year after year, because there's no amount of metric that substitute for total cost. And that is -- you've seen us do that this year. I don't think we've done that consistently in previous years, but it's where the rubber meets the road. Gerard Cassidy : Certainly does on the expenses and cost as you said. But you will certainly differentiate yourselves from you others if you could come up with a suite of metrics as you point out just to show progress over the last two or three years and then as we go forward just to show that the investing you're doing is paying real dividends\u2026 Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Gerard Cassidy : \u2026but thank you very much. Eric Aboaf : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is now open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks. Quick question on the management fees. I mean, I know there is movement and flows going in an out of the business, but how are you thinking about the fee-rate pressure in their going forward and that there is lot of zero-fee ETFs and all that. Are you expecting it to accelerate from here or decelerate? Ron O\u2019Hanley: It's certainly an area that we're concerned about Brian. At some level zero is the limit. And we don't see a widespread application of a zero fee, I mean, there's been a lot of attention paid to these zero-fee mutual funds and I think it's mostly been mutual funds not ETF at this point. So when you look at how those mutual funds are being employed, the distribution is being controlled by the sponsor. They're typically a part of a larger offering. So we don't see a widespread nor would be interested in participating in a widespread adoption of zero-fee vehicles. My intuitive sense is that there's been a lot of pressure here and a lot of movement. And that what we're probably as an industry far more likely to see is continued pressure on the higher end of the market and higher end of products. If you think about what the pressure has been, it's somewhat ironic that the pressure has been on the lowest-fee products. And you've seen relatively little pressure at the other end of the market on alternatives and things like that. I think you'll start to see more attention paid there. Brian Kleinhanzl : Clear. And then Eric, you did mention that you wanted to lower expense given in light of the revenue environment that you're facing. Does that mean you're looking for revenues to continue to be under pressure out in 2020 versus 2019? And you need to bring down the expenses just to have the positive operating leverage? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, it's Eric. It's you too early to begin to think about 2020. We're only halfway through this year. I think we've got some indications of where some of our servicing fee revenues are going to be in third quarter, and we need to navigate through the rest of the year. I think the broader statement that I made that I'll stand behind, I think and Ron and I and the management team is that this is an industry that where productivity really matters. It's not an industry where you got high single-digit revenue growth rates and if you -- if given that we always need to have expense programs, we need to have an expense program every year. That expense program needs to -- that may have some partial offsets of reinvestments, but those need to be calibrated, but this is one where the expense side of the question for the industry is twice as important as ever. So we'll continue to do that. And if we get -- as we get lifts in revenue, we want to get back to a place of margin expansion in ROE. And the best way to do that is to grow revenues and to drive expenses down at the same time. Operator : And there are no questions in queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to Ron O\u2019Hanley for closing comments. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, I just wanted to thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to having further conversations with you. Thanks very much.

On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley will speak first, then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2019 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions]. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix or slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligations to update them even if our views change. And let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 3, we announced our third quarter financial results this morning, reporting EPS and ROE of $1.42 and 9.7%, respectively. Before I go into more detail about our results, I'd like to discuss we're seeing in the macro environment. As one of the world's largest investment service providers, we have a unique window into global capital flows, despite an accommodative monetary policy supporting U.S. equities and global fixed income assets, a significant amount of cash remains on the sidelines. Notwithstanding that, both industry and client flows have improved in recent quarters relative to 2018. Relative to the year ago period, State Street's total revenue fell 3% reflecting lower interest rates, weaker international average equity market levels and challenging industry conditions, including price compression, partially offset by the positive contributions of Charles River. When compared to the second quarter, however, total revenue increased 1% driven by higher servicing fees, stronger net interest income and better foreign exchange revenue. We are encouraged by the direction of our servicing fee revenue and believe that our efforts to improve revenue performance are having the intended impact. We are making progress, we are not yet where I would like to see us as a business and reigniting servicing fee growth remains a priority. Assets under custody and administration increased slightly quarter-on-quarter to $32.9 trillion, and we are pleased with the level of new wins during the quarter of $1 trillion, while assets yet to be installed increased to $1.2 trillion. At Global Advisors, we also had a good quarter. Assets under management increased by 1% quarter-on-quarter to just under $3 trillion, supported by higher period end-market levels and relatively strong ETF and cash inflows. I'm particularly pleased by the third quarter of consecutive net inflows. We are making good progress across the enterprise, but we are not yet hitting our full potential, which is why reigniting servicing fee growth remains a top priority. I would like to provide you now with an update on some of the strategic progress we are making to improve our revenue growth as well as our operational efficiency. First, regarding reigniting servicing fee revenue growth, we are seeing some tangible progress as demonstrated by this quarter's performance, part of this initial success is due to a strengthened focus on our clients. We have made some appointments in key strategic areas of focus, such as what the recent announcement of our new Head of U.S. Asset Owner Relationship Management. In addition, we have expanded our management committee in recent months adding to the diversity of our leadership and talent. Furthermore, we are taking steps to improve client service quality by reassessing and leveraging the capabilities of our newly combined operations and technology division. Regarding operational efficiency, expense management remains a key focus for all of us. As a result of ongoing process reengineering and automation efforts, we have been able to reduce high-cost location head count by more than 2,700 year-to-date, already exceeding our initial target of 1,500 by year-end. Furthermore, our $400 million underlying expense savings program for full year 2019 has already achieved $275 million in total year-over-year growth savings in the first 9 months of the year. You will recall that last quarter, I announced that we are in the process of updating our core business strategy to help us return to stronger revenue growth as well as conducting a fundamental reassessment of our technology ecosystem in order to improve our operational efficiency in the near term. This reassessment is underway and we have taken early actions in this regard. In recent weeks, we have rationalized some of our technology head count. There are a number of areas we are examining to create better technology outcomes at lower cost, with an increased emphasis on development projects and innovation that have a direct client service benefit and strength in our resiliency. We continue to expect that we'll be able to provide further detail on our reassessment later this fall. Our vision remains becoming the leading asset servicer, asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Our front-to-back platform, which we have branded Alpha is key to achieving that vision in our financial targets over the medium term. This Alpha strategy is facilitating deeper client relationships, allowing us to increasingly become their essential partner, while delivering operational efficiencies to both our clients and State Street. Our front-to-back asset servicing platform continues to have a strong pipeline with a number of clients in exclusive negotiations. The level of client engagements remains at an encouraging level. Regarding shareholder return, following our strong performance under the 2019 CCAR stress test, we recently announced an 11% increase to our quarterly common dividend to $0.52 per share and returned approximately $690 million to shareholders, including $500 million of common share repurchases during the third quarter. We expect the changes to regulatory capital requirements will support our ability to return additional capital to our shareholders in the future. To conclude, our immediate focus is on delivering world-class client service, while finding ways to reignite revenue growth and generate expense reductions through sustainable improvements in our operating model. We are making progress in all of these areas. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start on Page 4. On the top left panel, we show our GAAP results as well as certain results ex-notable items in the bottom for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. On the right panel, we summarize notable items, which amounted to $45 million pretax or $0.09 per share in the third quarter, consisting of $27 million in acquisition and restructuring cost primarily from Charles River as well as $18 million in legal and related expenses. The A&R costs are in line with our expectations and are helping us deliver on anticipated CRD expense synergies. For period-on-period comparisons, recall that we had no notables in third quarter '18, but we did have $12 million of A&R on a pretax basis equal of $0.03 per share in the second quarter, primarily due to Charles River. Turning to Slide 5, we saw period-end AUC/A levels decline 3% year-on-year and up slightly quarter-on-quarter. On a year-on-year move was driven by the impact of a previously announced client transition, partially offset by higher spot market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the modest AUC/A increase was mainly due to higher spot market levels and client flows, partially offset by the same previously announced client transition. In regards to the transition, recall that this was immaterial to quarterly revenues since the end of 2018, and we do not expect any further material revenue drag. AUM levels increased 5% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter on just about $3 trillion driven by higher U.S. market levels and strong net flows. Third quarter '19 saw net flows of approximately $13 billion, driven by cash products and ETFs for third consecutive quarter of positive inflows. Moving to Slide 6. Servicing fees were down 5% year-on-year, but down just 3% year-over-year ex-FX. As Ron discussed, while challenging industry conditions persist, the pace of quarter-over-quarter servicing fee headwinds continue to moderate in third quarter with this quarter's results showing a sequential increase, primarily driven by higher average market levels, net new business and some market-based catch-up accruals. And while 2 quarters are not yet a trend, we continue to believe that the actions we have taken since late last year, including the rollout of our new client coverage model and the newly formed executive review committee to strengthen pricing discipline are having an impact. Nevertheless, as Ron also mentioned, we remain unsatisfied with these servicing fee results and recognize that still more needs to be done to reignite revenue growth. On the bottom right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $1 trillion in third quarter, which also raised our assets to be installed. The sizable win this quarter demonstrates the benefit of our scale and capabilities, including a mandate from an existing large client as we continue to grow our relationships. Turning to Slide 7, let me discuss the other revenue line. Beginning with management fees, third quarter revenue was down 6% year-on-year, driven by the ongoing impact of the late 2018 outflows and mix changes away from higher fee products, partially offset by higher average U.S. equity market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% driven by higher average U.S. equity markets, increased head count and good inflows. FX trading was down 1% year-on-year and up 4% quarter-on-quarter as the business benefited from the volume and volatility uptick in August relative to the prior quarter. Securities finance revenues were down 9% year-on-year, modestly reflecting the CCAR-related balance sheet optimization made in the second half of 2018 and down 8% quarter-on-quarter due mainly to the absence of 2Q seasonal activity. Underlying this seasonality, we are seeing some stability as our new optimization actions will position us for growth as we see client demand rebuild. Finally, processing fees were up year-over-year reflecting approximately $77 million in revenue contribution from CRD. Quarter-on-quarter, processing fees were down 15%, driven by lower market-related adjustments as well as lower CRD revenue due to the timing of new business and renewals. Moving to Slide 8. You will see in the top left panel a summary of CRD's operating performance in the third quarter, generating $85 million of stand-alone revenues and $56 million of operating expenses, resulting in $29 million of pretax income. The business also saw $5 million in new client bookings during the quarter, all external. While revenues were a bit lower this quarter due to the timing of new business and renewals, the business continues to perform in line with our expectations. The uptick in operating expense in the quarter was anticipated and driven by a planned increase in investment spending to support new business growth. I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in the 606 revenue reporting standards and not to read across any one quarter's results. Turning to the upper right panel on this page, we wanted to, again, provide you an update on our active client discussions, regarding CRD. As you can see here, our client discussions continue to advance. We're now actively engaged with approximately 130 clients, representing approximately $41 trillion in assets. As anticipated these dialogues are resulting in a variety of revenue opportunities, and we remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. On the bottom 2 panels of the page, we've again listed some of the growth and synergy milestones achieved this quarter. As mentioned earlier in the call, our front-to-back pipeline remains strong as we saw an increased number of clients in exclusive negotiations and expect more announcements to come. These front-to-back deals will also help drive growth in our core servicing business, as they typically come with some combination of custody, accounting and middle office revenues in addition to Charles River specific revenues. Turning to Slide 9. NII was down 4% year-on-year, with our NIM declining 6 basis points. On a sequential basis, however, our NII was up 5%, with our NIM increasing 4 basis points. The sequential increase in NII was primarily driven by episodic market-related benefits worth about 3 percentage points as well as higher client repo activity and active deposit management. Absent these episodic benefits, NII would have been about up 1% sequentially. We have been seeing some success in our deposit gathering initiatives with our average total deposits growing for the second straight quarter. These initiatives include a variety of efforts such as suite program minimums, targeting new client segments and adding market rate funding. This active deposit management may help us offset a portion of the impact from deposit rotation in some quarters. We were particularly pleased with our success this quarter in that regard, but we still expect to see continued gradual deposit rotation and the effect of lower long rates. We also responded quickly to Central Bank rate reductions, both in the U.S. and Europe with appropriately aggressive deposit pricing actions. And finally, on the earning asset side, we continue to target careful growth in client lending in a modestly larger investment portfolio. On Slide 10, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter, ex notables. So the trends are readily visible. Year-on-year, our expenses, excluding notable items were up 2%, but down 1% excluding Charles River and down slightly quarter-on-quarter. We've also now seen 3 consecutive quarters of total head count declines, driven by the ongoing reduction in our senior ranks and the previous hiring freeze implemented earlier this year that have reduced our high-cost location head count by more than 2,700 year-to-date, exceeding our original target of 1,500 by year-end. The cumulative impact can be seen in our compensation and benefits line as it is now down 2% year-over-year or down 4%, excluding Charles River. As we've been able to move, we're up to lower cost global hub and achieve greater efficiencies via automation while actively improving client service levels. Moving to Slide 11, we wanted to show a full year view of underlying expenses, which excludes Charles River, categorized by IT, operations as well as business segments and corporate functions, though you can see where we're delivering expense reductions and where we still see incremental opportunities going forward. As you can see, due to our ongoing cost management efforts for 2019, we expect to achieve year-on-year expense declines in 2 of these 3 major areas, with significant efficiencies realized in operations as well as our business and corporate functions. As we said last quarter, the growth in our IT spend is too high and that is where we are in the midst of the top to bottom review, Ron mentioned earlier in his remarks. In fact in IT, we have already identified a number of optimization opportunities with this technology reassessment and have taken some early actions, including rationalizing of approximately 275 staff this quarter. We remain confident that we can continue to realize the incremental benefits from automation initiatives, while delivering improved risk quality and expect to share more detail on this assessment and its potential efficiency opportunities before year-end. Moving to the right side of the page, we remain on track to achieve $400 million in expense savings this year having already realized $275 million in savings year-to-date, we have made some resource discipline and process engineering efforts, resulting in an anticipated 1.5% reduction in our full year underlying expense base year-on-year, which surpasses our original start of the year 1% reduction target. Moving to Slide 12, our capital ratios remain largely consistent quarter-on-quarter, with our standardized CET1 at a 11.3% and our Tier 1 leverage at 7.4%. We returned a total of approximately $690 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, $500 million of which were share repurchases. The $690 million is a 45% increase from the $475 million returned in 2Q '19, as we began to execute on our 2019 CCAR plan and deliver on our priority of significantly increasing our capital return to shareholders, and the $690 million represents a 130% of net income available to common shareholders. On the left side of the page, you will see that our investment portfolio grew sequentially as we reinvested cash and maintained significant CCAR stress capacity. I would again note that we are confident in our capital position believe that we have created some headroom and that has proposed changes deliberate ratio rules are being finalized, we will continue to examine associated capital optimization opportunities. Moving to our summary and outlook on Page 13. We were pleased to see the continued moderation in servicing fee headwinds during the quarter and our global effects business provided better-than-expected revenue results. NII increased 5% sequentially driven by some episodic market-related benefits, while we saw deposits stabilize in the quarter due to our deposit gathering initiatives. Deposits are tough to predict, of course, quarter-on-quarter and prevailing rates continue to trend downwards. The underlying expense reduction we've achieved to date demonstrates our ability to further bend the cost curve as we've now reduced our total head count 2% year-to-date and are on track to achieve this year's updated expense savings target of $400 million. Finally, we began to deliver on our priority of increased capital return to shareholders and believe we are well positioned to continue to optimize our capital stack consistent with regulatory development. In closing, I'd like to cover our 4Q '19 outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, we currently expect fee revenues to be up 1% to 2% driven by CRD, assuming third quarter '19 end of period market levels. We expect servicing fees to be flattish in spite of the third quarter catch-up accruals as pricing pressure continues to stabilize. While management fees are expected to be up 1 percentage or 2 driven by the carryover of strong inflows from this quarter. And while markets are always difficult to forecast, we currently expect our mark of the businesses to be down somewhat assuming lower levels of volatilities than third quarter, while processing fees are expected to be up sequentially driven by fourth quarter seasonality in Charles River and the absence of some market-related adjustments. In regards to NII, we will continue to see downward pressure from the declining long rates and with another rate cut, we would expect to be down 3% to 5% on a sequential basis, excluding the $20 million of episodic benefits we experienced in third quarter. On expenses, we expect expenses, excluding notable items and including CRD, to be flat to sequentially. At the same time, we remain confident in achieving our full year underlying expense reduction of 1.5% year-on-year, excluding both notable items in Charles River. And as we mentioned previously, we are conducting a fundamental review of our technology cost structure and expect that more information to share with you later this year. Finally, we expect to see the full year tax rate come in at the lower end of our tax guidance of 17% to 19% for the full year. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, let's open to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : So maybe starting with the question around servicing fees, obviously nice to see commentary around migrating pricing pressure again here. Maybe give us an update where that stands, I think, 4% down is kind of how we're thinking about 2019. As you look into 2020, how do you expect these pricing pressures to evolve? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric. It's a little early to take a full year look at 2020, but I think we've started to see a couple of quarters here some moderation in 2019. So in second quarter, we've again seen some of those early signs. They continued this quarter as well. And as we have reviewed the book of some of the larger than historical pricing concessions, you recall we were tracking the top 100 clients. We're now through 75%, 80% of that book. And then that gives us an ability to begin to look forward into fourth quarter and even into the first quarter of next year. And as we look forward into those time periods, we continue to expect the moderation to continue. That's the kind of the indicator. So I think if we step back and ask the broader question for what's driving some of those changes, I think there are really 2 things. I think on one hand, we're beginning to see the effects of our coverage teams and how we have upgraded our coverage force to better client -- better cover clients and bring together the full set of discussions in one place. And then with our executive review pricing committee, we've actually brought up the pricing decisioning to literally just a handful of senior executives. And that's given us the ability to influence the amount and the direction of that -- those pricing adjustments. And at the same time, actually, we're collaborating with our clients around where there is incremental business to be brought on. And I think what we're starting to see is the effect of that senior control and engagement have its effect on the revenues in these quarters. Alexander Blostein : Got it. And then my second question is around servicing fees, again, maybe a little bit more specifically related to the quarter, it's obviously $1 trillion in wins is a big number, $1.2 trillion pipeline is a big number. Definitely appreciate the effort to sort of communicate the drivers of servicing fees in a more transparent fashion. But in the past, we've seen big AUM, AUC numbers, but the translation sort of into fees have been sort of underwhelming. So can we talk through maybe the impact of these wins on the revenues, and ultimately, the timing of when that's going to hit? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric, again. I think as you would expect in our business, our business is lumpy, and it also comes with a range of different wins and new business engagements. I think, it's hard to predict for any one quarter, what the effect of the -- on future revenues. And I think we've been quite clear in the path and sometimes we have large wins that start with one particular product, sometimes we have larger or smaller wins that come on with multiple products and sometimes, we see the follow-on activity. So it's hard to directly translate. And I think the other texture that I shared with you is that our business is multifaceted across products and regions. And we've talked before pricing differs by region, emerging markets versus the U.S.; pricing differs by product, some of the cross-border funds versus some of the more typical 40 Act mutual funds. So hard to be emphatic about the exact correlation of revenues. But what I would say in one of the reasons we do track the AUC/A wins is we think it gives you an indication of client engagement, we're having the amount of client activity and business. And over time, it has -- that will flow into revenues exactly when and how much that's something that you'll see in the coming quarters. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Alex, it's Ron. What I would add to that is that we are very encouraged though by that number. There is a large existing client win in there, which reflects the trend that we've talked about for a long time, which is around outsourcing. But also in that number is a broad-base of very high-quality clients that are -- we think are just adding measurably to our book. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Just a couple of combined deposit rate-related questions. First, just definitionally, the down 3% to 5% next quarter, the base that we start from as we take out the 20 this quarter and then take it down 3% to 5% just making sure? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it's Eric. That's correct. That's the way to think about it. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Cool. On the -- if you look at your average non-interest-bearing deposits, they're down 17%, a lot of peers have seen similar numbers, but they're only down 1% quarter-on-quarter. And I'm curious, if you think we're at a more -- we're entering a bottoming stage, this is a more natural percentage of the overall book. Where does that accelerate as we have more rate cuts? Just curious how are you thinking about that? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it's Eric. I'd like to see a couple of more quarters here before we make a judgment around the direction of non-interest-bearing deposits. I think, we've seen a consistent reduction, I think, about over the last 2 years in this kind of 15% to -- 18% to 19% range. It's been a little bit lumpy in some of the previous quarters. I think you can look back a year ago, it's a little bit lumpy, up and then lumpy back down and impact the trend. So it's hard to read into one quarter's performance exactly what the future holds. So I think we'd like to see a couple of more quarters and we'd like to see a couple of more quarters actually at these new prevailing rates because remember part of the driver for the rotation was the higher rates that Fed had brought us to. Now that they've cut rates a couple of times and they're continuing to cut, the differential between non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing becomes smaller. And so that may have an effect as well. So I think we were pleased with the results this quarter on non-interest-bearing, we're pleased with the results on interest-bearing as well, because we're able to manage pricing quite actively as the Fed and the ECB cut rates, and I think we're going to be watching this one closely, I think with everyone else. Glenn Schorr : Cool. Definitely helpful. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: And what I would add to that is, it's Ron here, that somewhat analogous to how we're managing servicing fee pricing are, we're managing deposits and deposit pricing at a very intensively at a client-by-client level. So well, nobody is happy with the trends that we're facing in the environment that we're in this. It relates to deposits. I think the team is working very hard to manage these quite intensively. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Brennan Hawken : Actually just wanted to follow-up on Glenn's questions on deposits. So the interest-bearing deposit cost dropped a lot, you referenced that, you talked about how that's becoming integrated. I think you also referenced until we saw the move by this -- the Fed and the move by ECB. Is there a way to parse out the impact by currency, where you're seeing betas shake out in U.S. dollar and in euro? And can you give us a sense about whether there was noise? And if you guys competitively feel as though you are sort of leading the charge? How are you stacking up versus how some of your competitors are responding? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. Let me take that from a couple of different directions slightly so I think you've asked the currency question and the different kind of areas of pricing on deposits because it is one that we've been working on intensely. And just for context, for you, but for others as well, right as the -- in the last couple of rate increases, we got to a place where deposit betas were rising and we're quite high. And what we've been able to do in this particular quarter, both in the U.S. and international, have actually effectively run with symmetric betas and reduced pricing quite a bit in line with the Fed and the ECB. As we -- if I were to summarize the beta analysis for the U.S. our betas were about 50%. So we're able to push down deposit rates quite a bit in the U.S. as the U.S. rates came down by the 25 basis points in the last rate move. And then with the ECB rate cut, that was a 10 basis point move. We're able to actually reduce rates even further even more than the 10 basis points because we're really in a scenario in Europe where we're going to be negative and nonnegative temporarily, but negative for a long, long time. And it needs to be a place where we and, I think, all banks actually kind of at least turn fair margins. And so that's been part of our very active management of deposit pricing. And we'll take that kind of approach around the world as we see rate cuts, whether it's in sterling or Canadian dollars or Aussie dollars or in some of the emerging markets as well. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Eric, and then when we think about NII in the guidance, I think you had -- you're talking about a number using the midpoint to get you right around $600 million. And yet this quarter for backing out the onetime, the NII was up nearly 2% linked quarter, and you guys previously taken up your guide to about flattish. So I guess, what I'm curious about is, what is embedded in NII? Do you expect your deposit cost dynamics would be similar to this quarter? And what are you expecting from an asset yield perspective? Can you kind of help us understand the composition of that guide? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think, let's take 2Q to 3Q and then we'll fast-forward to 3Q to 4Q because it gives you some perspective. I think ex the market-related adjustments on NII from 2Q to 3Q, we certainly had some down draft from long rate, that's affecting us and other institutions. We actually had a slight uptick from deposits, so that was part of our deposit raising initiative. And we got some benefit from our larger loan book and investment portfolio. And then our repo activity did well as well as we continue to grow some of those balances. If I then think about that in -- from third quarter or fourth quarter, we're going to continue to get it down draft from our -- from long-term rates, right, that's just playing through and it's an effect that the long rate fall from the last 3, 4 quarters are starting to accumulate, and that's what's -- that's the primary item coming through. We expect to see some reduction from deposit rotation, because, as I mentioned in the previous question, net interest -- non-interest-bearing deposit rotation will continue. We'll try to offset that, but we'll see. And then obviously, as we -- whether we issue a little bit more debt or make other adjustments from the rest of the portfolio, there's always likely to be a little bit of other effects. So I think we're on this trend line where lower rates create some -- a trend that is not in our favor. And what you've seen us do is everything we can, whether it's with pricing or balances or asset size to try to offset that, and I think what you'll find is in some quarters, we're able to offset those that longer trend, and other cases, we may not be able to. But that's the -- we're very focused on finding ways and pushing on a number of those levers that we have to find offsets where possible. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Eric, to follow up on the cost side, I saw your guidance in the deck just that you're expecting flattish cost both on an ex CRD basis and then I think that's what's implied for the with CRD basis. What I wanted to ask you about is, first of all, when do we get to that right run rate for the Charles River extends growth that we've been seeing, #1? And then #2 is, once you get to the $400 million run rate also in the fourth quarter, you had this nice 1.5% decline this year, and you've said that you would be focused on still getting cost down at the core. Can you continue that pace of decline as you look ahead into next year? Eric Aboaf : Ken, sure. A couple of things, I think on Charles River, we're obviously investing in that business as part of our growth strategy. And I think you've seen the revenue numbers. They tend to be little lumpy. But we're very pleased with the early signs around some of the synergy assumptions that we had in some of the -- some of our acquisition modeling that we had done, that we had shared with you back a year ago. The cost will trend upwards in Charles River. I think costs came in a little more quickly this quarter than in third quarter relatively to second quarter than second quarter versus first quarter. So it will come in ways, but it's all meant to try to drive either sales and sales capacity or the installation engineering that we need because that's historically been a bottleneck for them to be able to recognize revenue literally of bolting it on and providing the necessary integration for clients. So that's what's driving some of the cost there. And we feel like that is, well, those are sort of good cholesterol costs, those are the costs that will drive current and future revenues, and we'll continue to invest accordingly. If I step back on the broader question of expenses, you've seen and we were purposeful on describing Page 11 that historically I don't think we've been as good as we should have been or we would have liked to have been on cost. Since for the last few years, we've consistently grown our expense base. And as you know, with the 1.5% forecast down this year, this is the first year that we are really bending that curve in a significant way. If it -- when it comes to what we're going to do going forward, I think we've said that we have to continue to work on expenses and productivity, right. There is no other course of action in a productivity focused and a slower growth industry like the one we find ourselves in. And as a result, we're going to continuing to find ways to drive down expenses. And what we've tried to do is enumerate on levers so that you can try to see, you can actually see the range of actions, whether it's the comp and benefits side, whether it's on a nonpersonal side, and we've also cut it through the different areas : IT, operations and some of our business costs. So every one of those lenses provides I think an opportunity for us. We're not going to start to predict next year's cost. I think that we'll spend some time on in January as we report fourth quarter earnings. But I think, you can be assured that the direction of travel for our cost base have to be down, not up, and you've got a management team here that's committed to finding a way to do that. Exactly how much and in which areas and in which quarters, that's the kind of planning that we're assembling like as part of our budgeting right now and we'll be sort of come back with a good amount of specificity in January with our 2020 plans. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Ken, it's Ron. Let me just underscore Eric's last point there because of what we've done this year is reduced our expenses while continuing to invest in the business and create a value proposition to our clients that we think is superior to our competitors. But what we recognize that our returns aren't where they need to be. So what you should expect from us is more of the same and we'll come back to you with specifics. Kenneth Usdin : Great. And one just quick follow up for Eric. Eric, did you say -- sorry, if I missed it, the premium am you would expect that to increase from second to third, can you just tell us where the two win from? And then now that we've re-based, is that at or kind of a flat level from here? Or do you expect an incremental as you go forward? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Ken, it's Eric. The disproportionately high premium amortization that we saw in the second quarter has begun to burnout and we're pleased with the third quarter results. And so I don't think we expect anything out of source at this point. And that particular part of the portfolio has been -- has now performed much more closely in line with our expectations. I think the one thing we will see is continued effect of long rates, and that's just -- that that's from the overall portfolio and that's a little bit of what's driving the quarter-on-quarter guide on the NII, but nothing unique anymore as we had flagged earlier in the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions, one on the deposit suites, could you just give us a sense as to how far along in the program you are and how much more running room there is as your clients execute on that? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Betsy, it's Eric. So deposit suites are one of I'd call half a dozen different deposit initiatives that we're working on all around how do we both serve our clients as well as think about the appropriate kind of offerings, pricing and so forth. For background deposit suites came out as we looked at a large pool of a particular segment of clients. What we found was that we were sweeping down to 0, which ended up causing operational efficiencies and overdraft for clients in a way that wasn't particularly constructive for them. And in some ways, if you think about the retail world put both the client and also the company in a position which didn't make a lot of sense. And so we've effectively done on that particular initiative. And like I said, it's one of half a dozen initiatives that we have out there. It's just sweep down to a minimum, call it, it could be $1 million level as an example. And anything below that, that's in our client account either at a low rate or look typically at a low rate sometimes at a noninterest-bearing rate. The benefit of that over the course of the last 3, 4 months, it's been on the order of just under $1 billion. So it's something that helps, and that's the -- those are the kind of packets we take. We're rolling that out into some of our European geographies now. So you can now see that scaling a bit. But I guess, I would frame it as one of a long list of initiatives to find the right way to accommodate clients, the right way to do business, the right way to create the services, but also to have appropriate value both for us and for our clients. Betsy Graseck : So including all of the various programs, same kind of question, how long -- how far along do you think you're already thinking like 25% through, 50% through, 75% through just looking for the legs on them. Eric Aboaf : It's a good way to ask the question. I think we're part of the way through because as we rollout deposit program 1, 2, 3 and 4, and kind of finish #1 and go to #2, we're beginning to think about what our deposit programs 5, 6 and 7 and then implementing those and then going to 8, 9, and 10. So I guess, we think that the challenge that comes upon us by lower rates and less liquidity in the system, the challenge for -- how do we continue to innovate and expand, what we can do and what you've seen us do here is part of this is around deposits, what can we do in terms of how we take cash and support clients with deposits on our balance sheet. And then the broader set of engagement with clients, so how do you support them with all their liquidity needs. So think about the cash cascade, it's about what is the offering on deposits, what's your offering on repo and there is several different versions of repo and that's actually contributed to our NII. What can we do on money market sweeps and actually sweep more of their funds to -- into some of the SSGA areas, and that's where we've actually been particularly successful this year or to other third-party funds if that they're choosing and earn a transaction fee as part of the process. So I think of it as the cash cascade and -- because we don't have as large of a loan book as the more traditional regional bank or universal bank, what we're doing is thinking about where do you innovate and expand on the liability side. And suites is one example. Repo is another example, and so on and so forth are ways that we do that. And we'll -- it's upon us to continue to innovate in those areas and find ways to serve our clients. Betsy Graseck : And then just as rates come down, I mean, you do have clients that were expected, they are paying you through noninterest-bearing deposits. So as rates comes down, shouldn't the NII be start to grow? Eric Aboaf : As rates come down, they may choose -- clients may choose to be more noninterest-bearing deposits. I think we don't always see that when rates come down slowly, I think we see that typically in a quick recessionary environment, where suddenly clients have a -- an immediate surplus of clash, they leave it in accounts. I think because the rate environment has been well telegraphed here, clients are disciplined and are going to continue to be disciplined and they're going to think how much we're leaving noninterest-bearing, and we think there will be at certain amount there. I think what we're hoping is that the rotation out of non-interest-bearing slows down and maybe even flattens as rates trend down whereas -- but we need to see -- we need to -- we need more quarters to observe the exact trends in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : If you can please come back to the big servicing win on the $1 trillion is, I guess, first of all is to clarify is that all one client or essentially all one client? I don't know if you can name the client. But more importantly, what did -- what were you doing for them, specifically? And I read, it was an accounting service mandate, such as may be clarify a little bit of what you are -- will be doing for them now? And any color on the time line of when you will move that, start doing that function? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Brian, it's Ron. We're not at liberty to name the client. Firstly that it's not all one client. So as I said earlier, there is a large mandate in there, but there was also a rich mix of both U.S. and non-U.S. clients, new and existing that came through in the quarter. This was a client that was an existing client and then had chosen to outsource accounting to us, and we will be implementing that sometime in the first quarter of 2020. Brian Bedell : Okay. And they were doing custody with you, just custody or were they doing the office with you as well? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: They were doing several other things with us. Brian Bedell : Okay. And then maybe just on the portfolio reinvestment strategy, Eric. As obviously, we get more headwinds with potentially long rates moving down over time, just can you talk really quickly about the ability to either extend duration or move more into ABS from? It looks like you've been actually taking duration down a little bit over the last few quarters and as non-HQLA constraining that or do you think you have flexibility to improve the securities portfolio you'll use via the investment strategy? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. On the asset side, we really think about 2 drivers. We think about what we can do on the securities portfolio and we think about what we can do come on to the lending portfolio. And in fact, the first topic that we spent time on is how can we serve our clients on lending, and you've seen that grow at a -- I think at a better pace this year. It's capital call financing, it's 40 Act, leverage fund financing, it's lines of credit, and I think a nice mix activity. And in a way, it's extending our balance sheet, which clients -- the servicing clients value quite a bit. And it's actually partly a way to help drive some growth in NII and partly a way to solidify and actually drive some servicing fee growth. So that's the first part. On the investment portfolio, our perspective is that as we maintain stability in the balance sheet, find ways to keep deposit stable or even grow them, there is a natural ability just to continue to invest gently in the market. And I say gently, because we don't think it's a great time to add a ton of duration, given rates. We want to keep a portfolio that's relatively CCAR-friendly. So that means, there's some duration in there, there is a well-diversified book of MBS. And then there is some -- in the international markets, there are some of the high quality sovereigns in some of the other multinationals as well. And so in general, I think we're going to try to build the investment portfolio in terms of size, but we will do it at that pace, and that should be able to create a little bit of a NII. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell from Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : Eric, maybe just can you discuss a little bit how you're thinking the leverage ratio will evolve for you -- the trust banks? And if that's going to flip your constraining factor to CET1? Or do you think it still be the leverage ratio? And if it's the former, I guess, how do you think about what the right cushion is or right CET1 ratio with the -- inclusive of the SCB? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Jim. The leverage ratio is right now are binding constraint as we operate the company more than any other factor. And we've been hardened by some of the ruling or some of the legislation in Congress that came out on the leverage ratio and then some of the proposed rule-making that was out for comment, and that the Fed put out there through the spring and summer. And so we're obviously waiting for final rules on exactly how they propose to implement the Congressional legislation. Once that occurs, and we've all seen the proposed rules, so that will create some room in our balance sheet. What that effectively does is move our binding constraints from leverage back into CET1 or capital. And as a result, that should free up an ability on our part to reassess what's in our capital stack, and in particular, the amount of preferreds that we have that form the basis for the Tier 1 capital. And so that will be the approach we take in the first stage of capital optimization. I think once that occurs, your broader question on, what are the right CET1 target, the common equity Tier 1 target, it's something we have to navigate through, but we need to do it once we see the Fed's proposals on the stressed capital buffer and some of what the Fed has been describing is coming as part of CCAR later this year. And I think once we see that, then we, and in fact, other banks will have a better understanding for what kind of CET1 constraints we'll be under and what kind of targets we'll run -- we'll be able to run at. And I think once we see more of that, we'll be able to give you a little more of an indication of how we expect to operate. James Mitchell : Okay. That's fair. And maybe just one follow-up question on the pricing efforts. How does that work? Is it more about convincing clients to give you more ancillary business to offset some of the lower demands -- the lower pricing demands? Or are you actually able to kind of work with some of the larger clients to keep the fee rate higher or convince them to -- how does that work, I guess, in practice? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Jim, it's Ron. It's a little bit all of the above plus more. It's a -- and that's been part of the management discipline we've imposed here is to ensure that the conversation is comprehensive and not just about what are we paying and should it be less or more. So some of it is consolidating business, some of it is broadening the set of services that we provide, including the discussion on, for example, global markets. This is all occurring against the backdrop where we have fundamentally improved our offering for the addition of Charles River. So some of it is around that in terms of putting in place a move towards the long-term outsourcing of activities to us. So it's a holistic conversation. There's some patterns, but in effect, they're never the same. But it's all about managing it to something much more broad than what is the rate that we're paying -- that the client is paying at any given time. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : I guess I'm asking for a little preview of your update before the end of the year. So when you say you are reassessing the tech ecosystem, kind of what does that entail? And is it -- I think I saw online you're looking to get a new CIO, is that correct? And so I guess, the question is, why and why now? And then lastly, Charles River selected Microsoft for the cloud and why did you choose Microsoft? I thought the other parts of State Street are using somebody else for the cloud, so maybe it's a hybrid model. Or just a little bit of color on the cloud strategy, management changes and what you mean by reassessing the tech ecosystem? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Well, Mike, it's Ron. As you know, technology is fundamental to what we do and the technology requirements of our business continue to go up. So we're operating in an environment where we've spent a lot. We have to ensure that we're getting the greatest return on that spend, and we have to ensure that we're continuing to innovate throughout this cycle. So for -- what we've done to date is get very disciplined about what's important to servicing and innovating on behalf of our clients, but at the same time ensuring that we're getting a return on that. We're also focusing on making sure that we're operating at the highest levels of technology and operational resiliency. What that requires is an intensive management of the process not just on a year-to-year, but on a month-to-month and week-to-week. Put in the vernacular, it's all about running the bank and changing the bank and doing that in an optimal way. So we are in the market for a new Chief Technology Officer. Our former technology -- we parted ways with our former Chief Technology Officer. That search is underway, and we'll have more to say about this later on in the year. In terms of Microsoft and Microsoft as a cloud partner, as we've talked about, I think, repeatedly with you and others, we're building out a true platform in this front-to-back offering. So it's not just about saying we've got a new additional set of products and services, but it's an integrated platform underpinned by the data that we are uniquely positioned to provide and manage. And we want to make sure that we're building that platform carefully. So Microsoft is the cloud provider to us, but is also working with us to help make sure that the platform itself operates as we want it to, that it's as much cloud-enabled as possible. And this was a competitive bid. We talk to basically all the providers there, and our feeling was that Microsoft brought not just a cloud capability, but an ability to ensure that our platform is going to be better than any other. Michael Mayo : And then, I guess, just separately, when do you look to convert State Street to Charles River, I think you had said you'd be your first client at some point? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. You're talking about our SSGA, that our State Street Global Advisors and that conversion is underway right now. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Just speaking on Charles River, Ron, can you share with us the success, the conversion rates that you're having when you go into pitch new business to a customer with the Charles River offerings versus what those win rates were for the traditional State Street business? Are you having more success or is it more challenging? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Gerard, if you go back to Slide 8, and we report on this -- we're trying to report on this on every quarter. There's a broad-base set of discussions underway. Those discussions are frankly more than we expected, when we acquired the business a year ago, and they range from \"Gee, we do a lot with you already, State Street, and now we see this Charles River thing to be exact opposite.\" State Street, we do nearly nothing with you, but we're seeing this platform that you're building and recognize that it could help us improve our business, improve our operations and create better investment outcomes. Those are -- these are discussions often times around the fundamental business model that these asset managers and asset owners have. So almost by definition, they're a -- they have a different cycle than a typical RFP-driven custody, this time it would be. What's encouraging about the discussions is that it's not just about Charles River, it's not just about let's bundle in Charles River to what we're doing with the client already in the back office, in the middle office. But it really is about how do we partner with you, State Street, and think about you as our outsourced partner or service provider and provide us a set of services that can help us create better investment outcomes. So they often time don't follow the usual prescripted RFP kind of time line, but we're highly encouraged by the fact that this pipeline that we've been showing you and again we're showing gross numbers here, but relatively few have fallen off somehow, but relatively few have fallen off and the discussions are continuing. We are in terms of where we are now, we're in exclusive negotiations at this point with several, which is more than we expected to be when we talked to you about the acquisition a year ago. So we remain very encouraged. Gerard Cassidy : And continuing with this line of sight, is there any synergies with it? If you've brought some Charles River customers on to the State Street platform? Is it -- could it be higher margin business or no? It's just the costs are different, and you just don't see those synergies versus again somebody that doesn't use State Street at all and you bring them on board, you're not going to get the synergy right away? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Well, it's a mix of both, but I'll talk to you about some of the early wins here, which has been existing Charles River clients that are now using us for various global market activities. That business tends to be quite high margin by enabling a Charles River user to access some of our various e-channels in the global markets business. We're giving relatively user-friendly access at a very high margin to some good products of ours. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just maybe, Eric, on the medium-term targets on Slide 16 in the presentation, can you frame out how you define medium term, is that 2 to 3 years or 5 to 7 years? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Gerard, it's Eric. I think, if you look carefully at the foot notes, we were targeting end of 2021, so that really means end of 2021 in the sum of run-rate basis 2022. And I think the perspective we have is those are the right targets for us as a firm. Now we set them in the very beginning of December 2018 and a few things have shifted since then, right the markets took a turn down and then, at least rebounded that was bad and then good. Interest rates, completely different environment, if you think about where we were in the fall last year and the tenure with that whatever 2.75% as opposed to 1.75% now, but we've seen sub-1.50% and obviously economic activity out there, there's some real uncertainty, whether it's with the foreign trade or global growth. So I think, some real events have transpired, but if we think about our business and the kind of margins that we should be delivering, the kind of returns that we should have and the kind of capital provision back to investors that's where we're headed. And I think our -- the work we're doing is how and how do we find a way to get there and get there at a -- as fast a pace as possible. And I think related to one of the earlier questions on the call, part of our expense program this year, which they needs to translate to additional savings next year, it's going to be a way to do that, as well as rebuilding the growth engine, because that's equally important than just navigating the rate environment. So I think those we feel are appropriate and we're going to come back over time with how and how we're going to take important steps in that direction. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Robert Wildhack : I wanted to ask about the ETF business with the e-brokers all going commission free. There's a view out there that this could be a big positive for the ETF space. Is that a view that you share? And if so, can you give us a sense for how you see that benefit playing out? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Rob, it's Ron. I think that anytime you're lowering your cost to the end user customer, I think it's good for the business. And in this case, we think it's particularly good for us because while we have a low-cost offering, we've not been honest many of the transaction -- transaction cost-free platforms as others. By kind of taking that out, it's enabling us to focus on where we truly are superior, which is liquidity. And if you think about this -- the various SPY offerings that we have, they're amongst the most liquid ETFs on the planet. In many cases, they constitute collectively a significant double digit of exchange volume. And as a consequence have some of the tightest spreads out there often. So we think that this is -- this enables us now to focus on where we are truly superior. So we look forward to this and I think it's a -- it will be beneficial to our ETF business. Robert Wildhack : And then we've talked a lot about pricing in the moderation you're seeing there, but I'm wondering if you could clue us in on how the pricing improvement is progressing relative to your expectations when you undertook all of these initiatives earlier in the year? Eric Aboaf : Rob, it's Eric. I think we went into this wave of pricing, which you remember was partly a catch-up as markets appreciate -- clients come back to us. But also realizing that some of our clients were under pressure, and we had to find ways to do right by them and become more efficient on our end to make it work. I think what I'd tell you is that we had patience that we could intervene and there were results that we could secure, but we weren't sure how much we could moderate pricing and at what pace to be honest, right? Because this was a bit of a new environment for us. What I would tell you as I think we were pleased to see some of the moderation in second quarter of this year because we only really set up, for example, our executive pricing committee late last year. So that's 2 quarters in. We're pleased to see again, third quarter feel a bit better and then have some visibility into fourth quarter as well. So I think we've been pleased with the pace, and I think it shows that if you put your mind to something and you take action and you put the right senior people and the right processes, you can have an effect. Now, pricing last year and this year will run as a headwind about 4% per year. If we can cut that back by a point and get it to 3%, I mean that's the first stage gate and that's what we're working hard to do. And I think our perspective is, we should continue to lean into our management practices and our approaches on pricing because they're having some of the desired effects, they're having them on a relatively good pace and it encourages us to continue to find ways to do more. Operator : Your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Marlin Mosby : I wanted to ask a couple of things here. When we look at the $275 million in expense savings and we're saying we're going to get to $400 million by the end of the year. How does that kind of equates, it seems like that's a little bit of a pickup and then we're getting relatively flat expenses between third and fourth quarter. Is that just being offset the growth you're seeing in Charles River or the seasonality of their revenues and expenses that are tied to that. So just wanted to see what the thought was there? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Marty, it's Eric. I think there are a couple of things at play. I think if you think about the quarterly pattern of the expenses last year and the quarterly pattern this year, we could begin kind of square that circle. I think on a year-to-date basis, ex-Charles River, we're down 2%. So we're certainly running at pace relative to where we were last year in the first 3 quarters of this year. So I think we feel pretty good about that. And I would tell you that expense savings come in waves. We've got very good visibility, 1 quarter out, and so we're quite pleased that we've been able to deliver the $275 million. And we see -- we have solid visibility and high confidence that we'll deliver the next $125 million and we'll put a bow around this and then begin our work on savings for next year as well. Marlin Mosby : I mean that gives you $30 million of incremental run rate ex savings that you get more in the fourth quarter, which would be a helpful. And then when you think of the premium amortization on mortgage-backed securities and the impact on NII, your quarterly NII peaked out about $700 million towards the end of last year and we're forecasting $600 million as we're going into the fourth quarter of this year. So when you look at that $100 million shift, the very lowest that we got to is around $525 million when we had rates at close to 0. So much of the $100 million that we've lost over the last year in NII is related to the amortization of mortgage-backed securities and the premium there? And then kind of give us the accounting of what happens once long-term rates stabilize? And is there any of that $100 million that's potentially recaptured as those long-term rates begin to flatten out? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Marty, it's Eric. The MBS premium amortization on the -- some of those Ginnie Mae pools that we had called out, that was worth on the order of $25 million, $30 million against the $600 million or $700 million that you described and that you have in our results. And for that particular pool from 3Q to third -- from 2Q to 3Q, we've actually been able to cut back on the amount of premium amortization, just as we've sold out of a couple of those positions and otherwise seen some burnout. So I think we're feeling good about how we've managed through that uptick, and now have seen that remediate. I think the broader question you're asking is around what's the direction of rates that the Fed is putting us on, are they going to cut once more or twice or 3 or 4 times, are they going to go back to Fed funds down at 25 basis point range because if they do that, that certainly puts pressure on us and all banks as a way in a manner to drive down net interest income and net interest margin. I think we're just going to have to see. I think what I would encourage you to do is go back though, take a look at one year ago, two years ago, three years ago because I think our low point was further down. And I think our balance sheet is of higher quality now and in a better position to manage through some of what we might have in front of us. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just two quick questions. On the $20 million of the episodic market-related benefits as you saw in NII, could you just go into a little bit detail as to what that was and their line items that had impacted? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Brian, it's Eric. So in NII, there are a couple kind of balance sheet type adjustments that we make at the end of the quarter, that tend to be a little lumpy, sometimes they're positive, sometimes a little negative, they tend to offset, but we had a couple of them that ended up in the positive territory this quarter. One of them was the marks that we take on our FX swap position. And when they trades cross quarter end and we do that just to make sure that we have stability given the volatility in some of those rates, we end up with a balance sheet mark that you take and then it unwinds effectively as the trade matures. So you get a kind of call it a September 30, December 31 that kind of impact, sometimes positive or negative and this time it was positive. The other activity that we do like all other banks is we hedge our long-term debt. We have to test for ineffectiveness and the ineffectiveness testing is sometimes little positive, sometimes little negative, again that one was positive. So those were the 2 largest drivers. They collectively were about -- they came to about $20 million this quarter. And in the past, they've been bouncing around plus $5 million, plus $10 million, minus $5 million, minus $10 million and just kind of part of what we have to book to as part of our financial process. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then a separate question on securities finance. You mentioned that you have new optimization actions ongoing. Can you just give a little bit more detail as to what that is? What the potential revenue opportunity is there? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Brian, it's Eric, again. Securities finance is one of those businesses that it has 2 features. I think on one hand, we had to make some adjustments to some of our counter-party positions in both FX and securities finance, this past year as part of some of our CCAR testing and some of our dialogues with the Fed. In the FX space, we're able to navigate through that because it tends to be a market with a large number of counter parties, you can do compression trades, you can do -- and you can diversify counter parties easily, et cetera. Sec finance is a little harder and I think that was one, where we felt more constrained over the last year, which is why our balance -- our lending balances are down and we've also had to constraint some of our activity, which has driven revenues down. What we have begun to do though is innovate in securities finance and find ways to refine some of our trading activity, some of our structures. We've also been innovating in some areas around peer-to-peer matching, right that creates some more latitude for us. And as we've begun to take some of those actions, we feel like we've begun to free up space relative to the constraints that were effectively imposed upon us a year ago. And so now the team feels as they've -- they're more open for business and so now we're out there engaging with clients. And part of what we now need to see is client demand come back because as you know, there's a lot of money on the sidelines, there's a risk-off sentiment. And so as we see borrowing and lending happen in that space, which particularly is the domain of the hedge funds and other market participants once that rebound since so which is really a kind of an industry demand and client demand question. Once that rebounds, we feel like we are better prepared now to begin to grow our activity. Operator : There are no further questions. Ms. Fiszel Bieler, I turn it over to you.

Ilene Bieler : Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A please limit yourself to two questions and then requeue.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change. Now let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Ilene and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 3, we announced our fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results this morning. Fourth quarter EPS and ROE were $1.73 and 11.6% respectively, while full year 2019 EPS was $5.75, and ROE was 10.0%. Ex-notables fourth quarter EPS was $1.98, and ROE was 13.3%. Relative to both the prior year period and the third quarter of 2019, I am pleased to report that our fourth quarter pretax margin improved, reaching 29.1%, excluding notable items. We also saw an improvement in pretax margin at Global Advisors relative to the third quarter of 2019. Before reviewing our performance further, let me touch on some of the macro factors that had an effect in 2019. Following the dramatic global equity market sell-off in late 2018, our results over the course of 2019 benefited from the steady recovery of the U.S. equity market during the year. While international equity markets improved somewhat, average levels in 2019 were still down relative to the full year of 2018. Total industry fund flows were favorable to 2018, primarily driven by broad-based flows in Europe and strong money market flows. However, in North America, industry flows into long-term funds remain negative, albeit less so than 2018. We experienced three interest rate cuts and lower long end rates which impacted NII, as well as low market volatility for much of the year, which in turn impacted our markets businesses. Our full year 2019 results also reflected the impact from the still elevated level of industry servicing fee pricing pressure, which moderated for us in the second half of the year. As a result of these headwinds, it was clear that we needed to take aggressive management actions to stabilize revenues and reduce expenses while keeping client satisfaction at the center of all we do. I am pleased with the progress we made and how that translated into results, particularly in the second half of the year. Assets under custody and administration increased 4% quarter-over-quarter to a record $34.4 trillion. We saw a strong level of new wins during the quarter, totaling $294 billion, which took our total wins in 2019 to just over $1.8 trillion within touching distance of our record amount of wins in 2018. Assets yet to be installed stood at $1.2 trillion at quarter-end. At Global Advisors, assets under management increased 6% quarter-over-quarter to a record $3.1 trillion supported by higher period end market levels and strong U.S. and European net flows to our SPDR range of ETFs. During 2019, Global Advisors recorded over $100 billion in total net inflows driven by strong ETF institutional and cash net flows relative to 2018. Relative to the year ago period, fourth quarter total revenue increased 1%, reflecting improved servicing and management fees, driven by stronger equity markets, partially offset by lower NII and markets revenues. On a sequential and year-over-year basis, fourth quarter total fee revenue increased 5% and 2%, respectively. Full year 2019 total revenue decreased 3% year-over-year as a result of lower fee revenue and NII, partially offset by the positive contribution of Charles River Development. We are pleased that we were able to begin to grow servicing fee revenue again with our focus on client service. Servicing fees increased 3% during the second half of 2019 relative to the first half of the year. During 2019, we implemented a number of client initiatives to drive better service quality and deepen relationships. This included the completion of our senior executive client coverage model for our largest clients. We also implemented a new client on-boarding process that has enabled us to scale rapidly and take on large tranches of business while also meeting client service requirements. Further, we implemented changes to better manage client pricing decisions with the establishment of an executive deal review committee. We know that there is more for us to do. And as we begin 2020, reigniting total revenue growth remains a core strategic priority for all of us. We believe that building out our front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients. During 2019, we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduce expenses. This time last year, we launched a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program to aggressively manage down expenses driven by new resource discipline, process reengineering, and automation efforts. Initially targeting $350 million of gross expense saves, we subsequently increased our expense savings target to $400 million, which we exceeded, finishing the year at $415 million in gross expense savings. Part of our efforts were aimed at tackling headcount growth, which have been too high for too many years. During 2019, we successfully reduced total headcount by 3% from year-end 2018 driven by automation and standardization as well as process reengineering, with high cost location headcount down by over 3,400. As a result, we reduced our full year 2019 expenses, excluding notable items in CRD by almost 2%, thus exceeding our initial target of 1%. As we look to 2020, we remain focused on reducing our total expense base again. This past December, I outlined the outcome of the initial reassessment of our technology cost structure. In the coming year, we are targeting a change in the trajectory of our IT expenditure, aiming for it to be flat to down 2% during 2020, excluding notable items. For resource discipline and process reengineering efforts, we are also targeting a reduction of total expenses company-wide, excluding notable items, by approximately 1% during 2020. During 2019, we were also particularly focused on balance sheet management. As a result of a number of deposit initiatives as well as improved client engagement, we have recorded a third straight quarter of total average deposit growth. In addition, as a result of an improvement of balance sheet under stress following the 2019 CCAR stress test, we increased our quarterly common dividend by 11% to $0.52 per share. Further, we returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders during 2019, including $500 million of common share repurchases during the fourth quarter. To conclude, during my first year as CEO in 2019, we have faced a number of challenges but through our actions, we have made measurable progress towards our goals, particularly expense management and capital return. My focus for 2020 will continue to be on delivering a distinct value proposition and world-class service to our clients, enabling us to reignite revenue growth while generating further expense reductions with sustainable improvements in our operating model. We remain confident in the trajectory of our business. We expect that our global reach and expertise in servicing and data analytics, combined with our unique front-to-back Alpha strategy, will enable us to realize our vision of becoming the leading asset servicer, asset manager, and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, I'd like to take a moment on Slide 4 to discuss several notable items. In 4Q 2019, we recognized $110 million of pretax repositioning cost consisting of severance and real estate, which sets us up to drive further process automation and organizational rationalization in 2020. We also had $29 million of acquisition and restructuring charges, primarily related to Charles River as expected and in addition, we had a $44 million gain related to the tender of sub debt in 4Q 2019 and a $22 million after-tax costs associated with the redemption of our Series E preferred securities. Taken together, we recognized notable items of $95 million pretax or $0.25 per share. You'll find a bit more detail in the appendix. Moving to Slide 5, on the top panel we show our quarterly and full year GAAP results. On the bottom panel, we show results ex notable items for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. I would note that we were able to generate positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both the GAAP and ex notables basis, helping to improve our 4Q 2019 pretax margin both quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year. Turning to Slide 6, we saw end-of-period AUC/A levels increase 9% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year move was driven by higher end-of-period market levels and client flows, partially offset by a previously announced client transition, which is now largely behind us. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC/A increase was mainly due to higher end-of-period equity market levels, client flows and net new business. AUM levels increased 24% year-on-year to a record $3.1 trillion driven largely by higher end-of-period market levels and strong net inflows of approximately $100 billion, which were spread relatively evenly across our institutional cash and despite a range of ETFs. Amidst the challenging organic growth environment for asset managers, State Street Global Advisors realized AUM share gains during the year in both money market funds and across our low-cost ETF array. It's a reminder that our business is positioned to further scale its offerings and to improve margins in doing so. Moving to Slide 7, servicing fees were up 1% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter. As Ron discussed, while industry pricing pressure persists, the pace of quarter-over-quarter servicing fee headwinds continue to moderate in 4Q 2019 with this quarter's results showing three consecutive quarters of stable to increasing servicing fees, primarily driven by higher average market levels and net new business. And while equity markets were supportive over the course of the year, we are confident that management actions taken since late last year, including the rollout of our new client coverage model and newly formed executive pricing committee, have had and are continuing to have an impact. Nevertheless, there is much more to do, as Ron mentioned driving higher servicing fee growth will remain a strategic priority in 2020. And we continue to see significant interest in our front-to-back Alpha platform. We now have four wins, all of which have expanded our scope of business with existing clients. On the bottom right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $294 billion in 4Q 2019 and approximately $1.8 trillion for the full year. The sizable wins this quarter and throughout the year again demonstrate the benefit of our scale and capabilities as we build new relationships and continue to grow existing client relationships by providing additional products and services. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other fee revenue lines, beginning with management fees. 4Q 2019 revenues were up 6% year-on-year, primarily due to higher average equity market levels and inflows from ETF and cash, partially offset by mix changes away from higher fee institutional products. Compared to 3Q 2019, management fees were up 4% driven by higher average equity market levels and inflows from ETFs, partially offset by outflows from institutional. FX trading services were down 7% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter as the business was negatively impacted by low volatility levels, partially offset by higher volumes. Securities finance revenues were also down 8% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter due mainly to lower industry volumes and spreads. Finally, software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 54% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting higher CRD revenue and positive market-related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, you'll see in the top left panel a five quarter summary of CRD's stand-alone revenue and pretax income. For 4Q 2019, CRD generated $126 million of stand-alone revenues, which was up 4% year-on-year and 48% quarter-on-quarter. I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in the ASC 606 revenue reporting accounting standards and not to read across any one quarter's results. On the upper right panel, we've also included a comparison of CRD's 2019 stand-alone revenue versus an estimate of 2018 revenue, pro forma for the ASC 606 reporting standard, had we owned the business for the full year. As you can see, CRD generated $401 million of revenue in full year 2019, up 8% versus $372 million of estimated pro forma revenues in full year 2018. On the bottom right panel, we wanted to provide you with a bit more texture on the momentum we're seeing in the business and how we've enhanced it since our acquisition last year. We remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. Turning to Slide 10, NII was down 9% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter, with our NIM declining 19 and 6 basis points, respectively. The sequential decrease in NII was primarily driven by the absence of episodic market-related benefits seen in 3Q 2019, partially offset by increased deposit balances. Excluding the episodic benefits seen in 3Q, NII would have been up 2% sequentially. Our deposit gathering initiatives continue to generate benefits. Average total deposits are up three straight quarters and up 3% year-on-year. Interest-bearing deposits are up 9% year-on-year, and noninterest-bearing deposits have been steady for the third straight quarter at approximately $29 billion. On the earning asset side, we targeted careful growth in client lending and a modestly larger investment portfolio, with both the average 4Q loans ex overdrafts and the investment portfolio up 12% year-over-year. On Slide 11, we're again providing a view of expenses this quarter ex notable so that the underlying trends are readily apparent. Year-over-year, our 4Q expenses, excluding notable items, were down 2% and flat quarter-on-quarter. You can see consistent improvement in the comp and benefits as well as several other lines. As you recall, we announced the 2019 expense program this time last year with an initial target of $350 million. And thanks to a significant company-wide effort, we achieved approximately $415 million in saves in the full year, exceeding our initial target by nearly $65 million. And so let me provide some color on a couple of optimization initiatives that really helped us reduce costs last year. First, supplier negotiations and consolidation have been a big focus. We've made great strides in both telecom and tech infrastructure services while also consolidating the number of our IT vendors. Second, the organization has been focused on realizing greater productivity. Automation initiatives launched last year have now led to four consecutive quarters of total headcount declines, resulting in high-cost location headcount reductions of about 3,400 this year, more than double our original target of 1,500. More to come in 2020 as we continue to work on every line of the P&L. Moving to Slide 12, during the quarter, we returned a total of approximately $686 million of capital to shareholders. And for the full year of 2019, we returned approximately $2.3 billion of capital, representing 108% of net income available to common, as we executed our 2019 CCAR plan and delivered on our priority of increasing our capital return to shareholders. Moving to the right side of 12, you can see that both the standardized and advanced approaches CET1 ratio is at a healthy 11.9% even with that level of capital return. We also consciously reduced our Tier 1 leverage and SLR ratios, primarily driven by the post-CCAR redemption of our Series E preferred stock, which is worth about $0.12 of EPS. We remain confident in our capital position and believe that we have incremental opportunities to continue to optimize our capital structure as changes to the capital rules are finalized. Turning now to Slide 13, I'd like to cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of 2020. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, we are assuming slow global growth interest rates based on the current forward curve, and a modest uplift from equity markets as well as continued low market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses. So beginning with revenue, we currently expect that fee revenue will be up 1% to 3% for 2020. This includes servicing fees growing modestly at the low to middle end of this range. Management fees growing at the high end of this range, and CRD revenue should grow at low double-digits. Regarding the first quarter of 2020, we would expect fee revenue to be down quarter-over-quarter by low single digits, perhaps 2% to 3% given headwinds such as the expected asset mix shift by a single client in asset management as well as seasonally lower CRD revenue. Regarding NII, we expect it to be down 5% to 7% in 2020 versus 2019 driven by the carryover impact of lower market rates and some continued rotation in the deposit book. Regarding first quarter of 2020, we expect NII to be down about 5% sequentially driven by the full quarter impact of the October's Fed rate cut, lower day count, and the fourth quarter long-term debt issuance. On a positive note, we do expect that NII should largely stabilize in the second half of 2020, assuming of course, that there isn't a significant change in the interest rate environment. Turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we will continue to be laser-focused on expenses and expect to achieve approximately 4% to 5% in savings driven by our continued focus on resource discipline and process engineering as well as our technology optimization plan. This will include a reduction in headcount of an additional 750 roles in high-cost locations in 2020, which is related to the repositioning charge I mentioned earlier. These expense saves will be partially offset by approximately 3% to 4% of ongoing business building investment scenarios like CRD, tech infrastructure, and the variable cost of new business growth. This should yield a net 1% reduction, excluding notable items, in 2020 total expenses. Regarding first quarter 2020, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19% range for the year, but we expect first quarter 2020 to be at the high end of that range. And finally, given our strong capital position and recent capital optimization, we expect to continue to actively return capital to common equity holders in the form of payouts and returns, subject, of course, to the Federal Reserve scenarios and associated approvals. So moving to our summary of full year 2019 results on Page 14, we were pleased to see fee revenue improve over the course of the recent quarters as management actions and moderating fee pressure helped drive total fee revenue up 2% in the second half of 2019 versus the first half. At the same time, we continue to navigate a challenging interest rate environment and enhance NII with deposit gathering initiatives with three straight quarters of total deposit growth. We also successfully executed on our full year 2019 expense savings program, significantly exceeding our initial savings and headcount reduction targets and helping drive down expenses, ex-notable items and CRD, by 2% year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to bend the cost curve. We're committed to doing more in 2020. Finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure and delivered on our promise of increased capital return to shareholders with approximately $2.3 billion in capital return in 2019 for a total payout of 108%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Operator, can we open the line to questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Eric, you just ran through a bunch of color on expectations for the year in 1Q. One that I was hoping to dig a little in on is the fee revenue side. I think you said that the 1Q fee revenue growth down 2% to 3% sequentially, and you gave a couple of factors. Does that guidance include what we've seen so far year-to-date in the equity markets, which has been pretty robust or is that a potential offset if it proves to be durable through the quarter? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. The guidance is effectively as a combination at the end of the year. And obviously, if there's large dislocations between then and now, we factor it in. I think you'd say equity markets are up. Volatility still, though, on -- and trading is still pretty light. We've not seen that big January uptick that I think we used to see four or five years ago. Interest rates have been, call it, puttering around. So I don't think there's a lot that's really changed, and this is an outlook effectively based on what we see now. I think as I described, there's some basis, just the usual seasonality like in Charles River, which peaks in fourth quarter just because of the cycle of sales that's come through and then dip in first quarter. We have some visibility into servicing fees. Asset management fees, I noted will take a bit of a step down. Trading, we'll see. So it's kind of a combination that we're looking at. Brennan Hawken : That's all really fair. Thanks for that color. And then when we think about some of these robust equity markets that we've seen, and you guys have clearly done a really good job of trying to get your hands around the elevated fee pressure that you were seeing over early 2019 and leading into that. In the past, we've seen some breakage in fee rate when equity markets rally really hard really fast because your servicing fees are not all just purely contractually a percentage of AUC's basis points on assets under custody. Some of them are inflation, some of them were pegged activity levels and the like. So can you help us think about -- should we be prepared for optically the way we model State Street some fee rate pressure here in the near term just because of those mechanical factors rather than thinking -- I just -- I know some people think that when the equity markets go up, okay, then the servicing fee is going to go up with the fee rate being flat. In the past, it hasn't worked out that way, so just trying to think about how to calibrate for that? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Brennan, it's Ron. Let me begin on that. I mean in the past, you're correct, there has been a cycle when you've seen sharp-up equity markets that has been followed by a relook by the client base at what they're paying, and we have a fee renegotiation. And that's still possible. I think what's different this time is, firstly, we have comprehensively been through the client base, either at their bidding or at our bidding. In some instances, we've been the proactive ones wanting to take control of the situation. We've tended to get more term out of these things. And in general, the level of partnership that's between us and our clients now is at a much higher level. So I would suspect -- my expectation would be that certainly, there'll be some conversation, but I would not expect the same kind of effect that we've seen in the past. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Brennan, I'd just add the kind of quantitative side to this is, remember, most of our fee schedules in the servicing business are based off of averages, average for a quarter or multiple months within a quarter or what have you. And so it's worth just remembering that if you take through the depreciation, stock market indices, and I think there is a good table on the top right of Page 6 in our slide deck, the S&P -- and this is 4Q to 4Q. But if you think about it on a full year basis, which I think a number of you have, the S&P was up 29% and the period -- end-of-period, that feels great. But the average was up only 6%, right? The EAFE average point-to-point was up 18%. On average, it was actually down 4%. So it's really the averages that are factoring through. And I just encourage you to think about those as you think about modeling the servicing fee effects. And in addition, those are what the -- but what we focus on, both from a -- as we think about the calculation of the servicing fees, but also what the clients think about as part of the billing process. Brennan Hawken : That's great color, thanks and apologies for jumping in the weeds straight off to bat on you. Operator : Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Curious if you could talk -- and you might have touched on it a little bit, but if you could talk on your deposit optimization efforts, what's working and where you are through the process you've been going through client by client. 4% growth is good. Do you consider any of it repo environment related and transient? Just curious to get the mark-to-market on that. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Glenn. It's Eric. Let me start. Deposit initiatives were something that we really began to focus on late in fourth quarter of 2018, I think I'd say, and then it's been an intense effort for 4 or 5 quarters now. And it really is in response to thinking about how do we serve our clients with our balance sheet. Now as you say, sometimes it's deposits, sometimes it's cash money market sweeps into Guest Manager. Sometimes it's some of the sponsored repo that we do. So there's a series of different areas. I don't think it's particularly -- the results of those initiatives on a year-on-year basis are north of $10 billion of deposits, tend to be more on the interest-bearing side because that's what's discretionary. It's come in probably three buckets. The largest of the buckets is working with our custody clients and thinking about how to serve them on their discretionary cash. Sometimes it's the asset managers. Sometimes it's insurers. Sometimes it's the pension funds. So that's been -- that's probably been the biggest piece. We've also, I think, built up over time a book of corporate deposits. Because remember, not only do we have partners and suppliers for corporations, but because of our custody of the pension plans, right, we have often an introduction from the pension -- the defined benefit pension plans or 401(k) plan into the corporate treasurer. And so that creates a natural access. And then the third bucket is we always supplement with a little bit of CDs or broker deposits, but I think that's been probably the smallest of this of the three buckets. So those are the kind of initiatives we've taken. They've been, I think, material in terms of continuing to build our balance sheet, which then lets us -- provides enough oxygen, in effect, for us to build our loan book, our investment portfolio, our trading book. And so that's kind of part of how we think about running the bank. And then specific to your question of what have been better, different, lower, higher because of quantitative easing or not, I don't think the initiatives would have been particularly different. I do think there is more deposits in the system, in the banking system, and we've seen some of that probably starting in the second half of the third quarter in that kind of period when the Fed began to intervene and into fourth quarter. It's hard to dimension how much there is, but you and I both read the Fed H.8 reports, and that kind of gives you a little bit of an indication. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. And maybe one more on just the servicing wins. $294 billion in the quarter, $1.8 trillion for the year. If you look at that, that's over 5% organic growth. Now obviously, it's a gross number, not net. I don't know if you want to share just a ballpark range of where net is. But then the specific question is if you can help us with the composition of what's in the one but not yet funded pipe, I see some of the press releases, I see some ETF wins in there in the fourth quarter, but maybe just help us think through what's in there? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Yes, Glenn. It's Ron. It's a mix of things that are in there. It's -- some of it is true one-offs, meaning we've won something. It's in the queue to be installed. It'll be installed. More typically, just given the nature of our client base, which tends to be larger asset managers and asset owners, when we win something, we install in tranches. Sometimes it could be very conventional business, like we have a very large mutual fund win earlier in the year. But some of the funds are more complicated than others. Sometimes the client wants it done in a particular sequence around their fund boards. So there's some of that in there. You can probably draw the conclusion that the more complicated of business tends to get involved later. The other thing that's in there, though, is, increasingly, the nature of our business is that we're not just winning a custody or accounting assignment, but we're winning all or a portion of the front-to-back, meaning there's some middle office in there, there might be some Charles River in there. So oftentimes, what you're seeing is a installation of another service for an existing client where we had an install earlier in the year. And that's the way to think about it. Glenn Schorr : Got it, okay. That's interesting. I appreciate it. And is it in and around the range of the average margin because I know going piece by piece would be impossible, but just like the ones that not yet funded, is it coming in at a higher level, average level or below average level? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it's Eric. It's -- I think, as Ron said, it's a mix. It's -- well, it's a mix of fee rate and it's a mix of timing. And as you could see, it could be installed where it's high a quarter ago. It's high again this quarter. And so sometimes this installs more quickly. Sometimes more slowly. So just -- I know it's hard to model. I just encourage you to put a big band around it. Glenn Schorr : Cool, well your outlook comments help, so we will take it at that. Thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks, good morning guys. To follow-up on the NII outlook, Eric, I was wondering when you talk about the expected decline next year, can you just give us a little bit more color on just the dynamics of how much and how the lower rates from last year still roll through on the NIM? And also against your point about there being some excess deposits in the system, but you're still growing these deposits from your strategic initiatives, can the balance sheet also expand to continue to expand from here, so I guess just a split dynamic of what happens on the NIM side versus what happens on the balance sheet? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Ken. It's Eric. You're right that -- you're asking the volume question and the rate question. So maybe -- let me do that in that order. I think from a volume perspective, the two drivers that we see in this business are firstly, the amount of wins that we have in custody and accounting because those typically come with those residual deposits that -- the frictional deposit in the system. So those will come based on the kind of the win rates that we have and some of the installation. I think the other one is the deposits in the system and I think we've clearly seen a bit of an uptick quarter-over-quarter based on the bank-wide data as well as some of the -- some of what you've seen in our results and a couple of the other banks that you've all seen that in the Fed statistics. I think the question is, what happens to deposits in the banking system over the next year? Did we just -- did the Fed in effect with its easing process over the last four, five, six months get us to a new level and then we just go back to the slow build off of that or is there going to be more or less Fed activity and I'll leave that one to -- for you to think about. I think that one is the uncertainty. So we do expect some amount of modest deposit growth. I think the -- what we're careful on, on deposits and we still expect to see is some amount of continued rotation from noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing or interest-bearing into treasuries because you're seeing that in the underlying asset holdings of our clients in the industry. And as we think about the volume of deposits going forward, we've been comforted that there have been three quarters in a row of stable noninterest-bearing deposits. But I'll remind you, third quarter and fourth quarter of 2018 actually saw an uptick in noninterest-bearing deposits, and then it fell by -- it fell significantly in the first quarter of 2019 from 4Q 2018. So we're hesitant to think that we're -- we've gotten to a sea change. We like to see a flattening of that line, but we're hesitant to call that a sea change just yet, which is why we do think there will be some continued rotation in the coming quarters and year. I think from a rate standpoint, it's everything you'd expect as long rates still have a negative effect on a full year basis again. So long rates, I guess I should say, long rates have a negative effect as the tractor of the investment portfolio plays through. And unless long rates pop up 30, 40, 50 bps, you still have that playing through to a negative. You have the short rates are -- kind of have been reset, and so we're going to -- it's going to take 3 or 4 quarters to lap ourselves, and so you have that effect playing through. And then you have some -- as we think about the first quarter, as an example, you've got some transactional impacts, right, as we call those perhaps, we replace them with long-term debt, right, because we have TLAC requirements. And so in effect, I end up with a higher net income, but the -- I get it -- we get higher available to common, but we also have a -- also have more interest expense because of how the P&L accounting is for us. So anyway, I'm hoping I covered most of it there. Kenneth Usdin : Yes. And just one more, just balance sheet structure question to your point on the preferreds. You did that redemption. You said you were -- last quarter, you're able to do that before getting even the final. Could you continue to do more in that ahead of getting the finalization of SCB? Or does now SCB finalization really lead any further decisions you make about the balance sheet structure and capital actions? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Ken, fair question. But obviously, we're -- any kind of decision by us around CCAR about interim capital actions is something that we just don't have an ability to telegraph beforehand or to really discuss. I'd just tell you, we always look at the full range of what we can do. We're always conscious that there are periods immediately after CCAR where one tends to have an opportunity. It gets a little more delicate in the first quarter. So let me just leave it at that. It's the kind of thing where I don't think timing matters a ton about when we take our capital actions, but the -- but we are looking at, obviously, the change in the leverage rules and then importantly, we need to see how the SCB comes through. And that's -- that I think we'll know in the coming weeks, and then we'll start to gear up for these -- for our annual CCAR process. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alexander Blostein : Thanks, hey, good morning everybody. Eric was hoping to dig into NIR in the quarter around some of the deposit cost trends. If I look at the non-U.S. side it looks like it was a negative 4 bps kind of number. I know there's some FX dynamics that are all through that, that could create a little bit of noise. But can you help us understand just kind of where you guys are in terms of deposit costs, how you expect it to evolve from here, and if there's anything one-off this quarter that helped that? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Alex. It's Eric. I think there are a couple of probably elements here that are going through the deposit costs on the U.S. side and then the non-U.S. side. And the page for those of you on the phone probably best to look through is the financial addendum that we have, page 7 there's a detailed sort of average balance sheet table of the last eight quarters for everyone. On the U.S. side, you see our deposit costs came down, I think, a nice 19 basis points. Most of that is on the U.S. fee side. Obviously, this is a domicile view, not the currency view, but it's indicative. And that's really the effect of that October rate cut and the full quarter effect of that coming through, adjusted for our mix of pricing and so forth. And so I think you see the right sort of betas in that kind of 50% range that we've been seeing flowing through that line. The non-U.S. domicile is a little messier. Part of what you see there -- and that one fell, those interest -- that interest expense fell more than you would naturally expect. It actually went from a positive interest expense to a credit in effect. Part of that was, remember, the ECB move, and we moved as well. We actually -- our beta was -- on that ECB move just as we had this begin to normalize NIM in the international markets as other banks are doing as well, given that it seems like it's going to be negative, not for a temporary period, but for the foreseeable future. And so we're beginning to -- I think the banking industry is beginning to reset what kind of NIM should be earned on deposits because of that change. And then we also have less in the FX swap costs and so we had less swap expense, which then goes through that line of the P&L and that we have in the footnotes, and that just bounced around a bit with the costs being on the interest-earning asset side. Alexander Blostein : Got it, that's helpful, thanks. And then a slightly bigger picture question to you guys on profitability. I guess when we take a step back, obviously, a very nice move on expenses this year, and you guys have more to do next year. I guess when you go back a year or so ago, you had a slide out talking about medium-term pretax targets kind of shooting for 2 percentage point improvement in pretax margin. That's still the case, but I'm curious what's the base and what total may be the destination here because in 2018, pretax margins were 28, 29. You guys are kind of 26-ish this year. So I guess off of which base should we be thinking about the two percentage point improvement? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric. Let me start on that because I think it's something that we've obviously been thinking through the markets. When we set those up with the markets at a certain point, they worked against us, both on the equity market side, which has largely bounced back. Now we need to kind of -- it's going to take a few more quarters to get to a place where we're pleased, and that was in our outlook. But it was also at a time when NII, right, was expected to go up, and NII has actually gone the other way. And I think I mentioned in one of the conferences late last year that, that change in NII cost us effectively two points of margin. That said, that's just information. I think when we think about how we need to run this business, we still need to drive towards those targets and drive to those targets at pace. And I think we've been clear that at the time we set those, the pretax margin was in the 28% range. And I tell you, we're at 26% now. We need to -- we've got plans to get to 27%, 28% and 29% and ultimately get that three handle or the 30% handle on margin because we think this is a business that should operate at that level. And I think if you work through some of our guidance for this year, you see us making headway on margin, driving revenues up and expenses down. And I think you'd continue to expect that kind of leverage. Operating leverage and margin expansion is kind of tantamount and kind of a fundamental part of our planning process. So we're standing by those targets. We think they're important, and they were well set and those are -- that's where we're headed. Alexander Blostein : Great, thanks so much for that. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks, good morning folks. Can you just come back to the pricing pressure concept in asset servicing and one detail I did miss, if you could just clarify, the fees down 2% to 3% in 1Q, just the servicing -- asset servicing fee component of that for 1Q? But the broader question is, we've had that 4% pricing pressure, I think, that you identified, Eric, a while back, and that had been moderating to that sort of 2% headwind. Just want to get your thought about that headwind coming into 2020 and clarify that, that's -- that is separate from a mix shift and when I talk about that as a -- the common mix shift towards ETF and away from mutual funds, which I know are lower revenue capture, albeit they are just as -- I believe, they're just as profitable because of the lower cost that's servicing them. So maybe if you could just talk about that dynamic in the -- as how that shapes that 2020 1% to 2% up for servicing fees? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Why don't I begin this, Brian because there's a lot in what you asked in terms of pricing and how we think about our outlook on pricing and pricing pressure. I mean if you look back on this business for time immemorial, right, there's been -- there's kind of enduring deflation in the business, which we've all come to know and live with, and that's been a result of a combination of business growing, ability to scale, et cetera. And that's been historically a 2%. There's also been mix shift that's been underway since then, too. I mean the mutual fund ETF move is not new. It certainly accelerated over the last few years. So -- and we expect that mix shift to continue. I mean the other factor in here is there's increasing concentration amongst ETF providers. We have a very large market share amongst ETF providers. But obviously, as those providers get larger, the nature of the fee rate typically is such that they're paying up less than the marginal asset. So -- but this is the nature of the business, and that's what we have to deal with. So we do think and believe and we've said that's important. The pressure that we saw starting in 2018 and continuing out into 2019, we think that's abating. But we -- this is a business that has lived and will continue to live in the face of ongoing fee pressure, which is why we continue to be intensively focused on our operating model and how we build the business that can not only meet that, but that can become more and more profitable in that kind of environment. Eric Aboaf : Brian, this is Eric. Let me add a little bit of a quantitative kind of estimations of the kind of Ron's summary there. So on pricing, I think, as he said, historically, there's always been a two percentage point or so headwind on pricing per year over the last couple of decade. Two years ago, we saw that tick up 4% kind of headwind. That was kind of 2017, 2018. And then last year, if you think about 2018 to 2019, that was also 4% headwind, roughly speaking. And then I think we've described how we've been marching through a set of renegotiations and resetting of pricing over that kind of 8 to 10 quarter time period. As we look into our book of business and think about this coming year, what's factored into our outlook is approximately 3% pricing headwinds, so down from the 4%. And we've got some visibility, good visibility into first quarter and second quarter. And so that's factored into our outlook on servicing fee on a full year basis. To your point of where does mix come out, mix comes out in how we describe client flows and activity, and it's been relatively neutral. Activity is up a little bit with clients. Kind of transactional activity that flows, you're right, tend to work the other way around. So that's been a more neutral effect in aggregate relative to past history where it's been a slight positive of a point or two. And then finally, on first quarter, you asked -- I'll just remind you that what I guided to on fees for the quarter was down 2% to 3% in aggregate for fees. The downdrafts that I noted were in management fees and in CRD. And so by omission, I didn't really cover servicing fees because we expect those to be flattish, and we'll see how they'll play out. But that's our current expectation. Brian Bedell : Great, that's great color. And maybe then just on CRD, you guys reiterated the revenue and cost synergy outline that you had from day 1. I know that's mostly a 2021 impact in terms of where you want to be. Maybe just an update on sort of the time line into that or how you're thinking about 2020 in terms of part of that $260 million to $280 million revenue goal for 2021. In other words, is that -- are you making material progress do you think in 2020 as it relates to your guidance there? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Brian, it's Ron. I would say we absolutely are making material progress. And in terms of the synergies that we outlined, both revenue and cost, we expect those to play out actually in the time frame that we described earlier. But the more important impact or the even greater impact of Charles River has been around how it's affecting our core business and changing the nature of the conversation and the relationships that we're having with our clients. As we noted, we signed 4 so-called front-to-back deals or Alpha platform in 2019. So in just over a year of ownership, we signed deals, which, in essence, means that we have a comprehensive and complete relationship with the client front-to-back. The pipeline there remains very strong. And even in those cases where the likely outcome is not a full front-to-back, it's changed the nature of how we're dealing with our clients from a one-off product provider to a true business process -- outsourcing partner with these clients, and I think that trend will carry on in many ways, fundamentally change the nature of our servicing business to the positive. Brian Bedell : That's great. And is it more of a linear progression through 2021 or more of a hockey stick into 2021 as the deals -- as you see these deals in terms of revenue? Ronald P. O'Hanley: I mean I'd expect it'll be largely linear, but with a bit of an uptick as we continue to build out the platform, I mean we announced over the year various platform partners that we've added to Alpha, and these are providers that are plugging into our platform and typically where we get a share of those economics. And I think you'll see at an increasing rate over 2020 and 2021 the number of those kinds of providers on the platform, and you'll see them -- the increasing importance of platform economics. And that will be less linear and more -- it's like how any platform grows, right? It starts out small and the momentum build as more and more become part of the platform. Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. Add to that, the -- if you think about the revenue trajectory on the synergies, for example, part of what you'll see is some of the leading indicators, like bookings, have started to tick up. You saw those were up 28% on a year-on-year basis. And so that's what will begin to drive the Charles River kind of specific revenues this year and next year. I think in contrast to that, some of the revenue synergies were around connections with the State Street base of revenues. And in particular, the trading and sponsored repo kind of revenue activity that we've quickly tried to link into Charles River tends to actually happen earlier in the three year cycle than later just because of the speed at which we can either make the client kind of connections or the order management system connection. So there'll be a mix and I think sometime this year, we'll probably do maybe a more fulsome kind of where are we as we're year and half, two years into this deal and try to share more information and it sounds like that would be helpful. Brian Bedell : Yeah, perfect, that's great color. Thanks so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Eric, I wanted to just -- Eric, and I wanted to just dig in a little bit on some of the comments around the expenses. I think during the prepared remarks, you mentioned that there's more to come, and I would expect that, just wondering, should we anticipate that the pace of change, the rate of change of expense reductions, is it something you think you can continue for the next few years? Or is this 2020, we get the 1% down and then it's more hold it steady or continue to grow, so while I should say it to you, but grow in line with just core expense pressure, so I just wanted to get your understandings to the duration of your expectations around the more to come? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Betsy, let me begin on that, and while we're not giving guidance beyond 2020 at this point, I would say that our ambition is to continue to manage expenses down, offset by the necessary investments that we need to make. We believe that there's more room for productivity improvement. Our automation efforts are underway, but we have much more in front of us than what we've accomplished. So we see a path to continued and ongoing expense management certainly through 2020 and likely beyond, is the way I would think about it. And part of that is we -- if you're going to win in this industry, that's what you need to do, right? We've talked about the servicing fee pressure, talked about the pressure that's on our clients, but it's also just about being able to scale at the level that we need to. I mean if you think about the amount of new business that we've brought in, the -- those assets could only have been brought in if there was confidence on the part of the client base that we would be able to scale that. And I just think that to be the leader in this business, we have to continue to get that productivity improvement driven by automation, driven by process redesign to be able to take on a business like that. Betsy Graseck : If we get... Ronald P. O'Hanley: Go ahead, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I was just going to say, if we get a slightly different rate environment where rates come down again, do you feel like you have the flexibility to ramp up that expense reduction? Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it's Eric. That was probably where I was going to go. I think we're quite conscious that in a slower top line growth environment, we're signaling 1% to 3% on fees this year. That's a year where you want to hold expenses, actually bring them down, right, because we need to create some real operating leverage and margin expansion. And so I think part of the answer to your question is if revenue growth is in that low single digits, then the expense is coming down, is the right answer. I think to your point and the precise question that if revenues take a downtick, whether it's interest rate-driven or something else on the equity markets or something, then we would go deeper into expenses and we ration our reinvestment and just do it at a -- perhaps at a different pace. We'd find ways to accelerate some of our other optimization efforts. You're seeing what we're doing in IT, for example, that we described in December. We'd go deeper there. And just think about where we were in January of 2019, we announced 1% down and felt like, through the middle of the year, the environment hadn't gotten appreciably different. And so we ended up with 2% down. I think that's the kind of incremental action we would find a way to deliver if the environment were not favorable. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. And appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe first question just on the CET1 ratio standardized, it jumped 60 basis points, look like a 5 billion reduction in RWAs. Kind of what drove that and is there more to do there? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it's Eric. I think you're on the capital ratio pages where we've shown this quarter both standardized and advanced. And we did that because our binding constraint now is effectively both. They're almost right on top of one another. And I think you need to be a scientist to really understand the trend in each of those capital ratios. So let me try, and I'll -- we'll do a follow-up if necessary. So standardized, if you remember, is more volume-driven with some very -- relatively simplistic factors. And so the standardized ratio actually improved because standardized RWA fell sequentially, and that occurred, in particular, in the standardized RWA of our FX activities and our securities -- I'm sorry, our SEC lending activities. And that's kind of related to the lower levels of volatility in the market and lower actions. So that was the biggest downward driver of standardized. If you take out your Ph. D. and want to think about advanced RWA, our advanced RWA went up, which is why the advanced ratio came down sequentially. And the advanced RWA increased because of loan growth and investment portfolio growth and a little bit of ops risk primarily. So those were -- it's a little bit apples and oranges, but that was the driver. I think from our perspective, we -- it just -- it's a good reminder that we live in a world of both, and we -- obviously, we'll manage to both. I think what I found comforting is, notwithstanding all our capital actions that we've taken and our higher payout, we actually are at real healthy capital levels, and that obviously gives us flexibility going forward. It sets us well -- it sets us up well for this cycle with CCAR, and we can take things from there. James Mitchell : Absolutely, standardized is what matters for CCAR, and that going up is certainly a nice positive. So -- but maybe just the second question, following up on your guidance of kind of fee revenue growth of 1% to 3%, just maybe to push back a little bit on it. If I look at 4Q fees and normalize for seasonality and processing fees and then just annualized 4Q, I get to almost 2% growth in 2020. So it doesn't feel like a very ambitious target when you think about the S&P is now currently 8% above 4Q average level. So you have a pretty big tailwind in the markets. You have about 3.5% of growth from AUC/A that's yet to be installed, the $1.1 trillion or $2 trillion is equivalent to 3.5% growth. You have the market tailwind, and you only have about 2% fee income growth. Is there something we're missing, I know you talked about the 3% reduction in the fee rate, but it seems like there could be a little better than that, and just please feel free to talk me down from that? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it's Eric. I'm trying to come up with a realistic forecast because, to be honest, we'd actually like to be realistic of what we're seeing. And we also want to -- maybe back to one of the earlier questions, if we're realistic on revenue, we'll do the right thing on expenses. And so both matter in this business. But I think this is a realistic forecast. And obviously, if something changes dramatically, we'll -- up or down, that could have an effect. But let me just go through the pieces, so that you have a sense. So on servicing fees, we said to the lower middle end of the 1% to 3% range. So I think that's pretty clear. I think if you think about it, the equity markets in the U.S. on average, and the averages matter here, will probably be up in the high single digits. So that'll provide a couple of percentage points tailwind in fees. There may be a little bit of -- there'll be obviously some amount of net new business, but there's also the fee headwinds still, that 3% that comes the other way that we need to overcome. And so that's why we get to the lower to middle end of the 1% or 3% range. And remember, there are some businesses that are, in servicing fees, that are driving very quickly. We've noted, for example, EMEA sometimes or some of the asset management space, but there are others like our hedge fund clients are actually tending to be relatively stable or even in downdraft in some cases. And so that works in different directions. So there are some puts and takes within the portfolio that we're always conscious of. I think on management fees, we said the upper end of that range, and I think you can square that with the lower step off in first quarter of 2020 that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Trading, I think trading is trading right now. I think you've seen it kind of trend downwards over the last year. I think volatility doesn't feel like it's moving up fast. It's not moving up fast, right? It's stable at best, leverage from hedge funds or from those who borrow or lend in the SEC finance business. If you look at the industry data, it's actually down year-on-year. And I don't see a quick turnaround for that. And so I don't want to gear a business model to an automatic recovery in trading volatility and opportunities to find wider margins and so forth. And then there's our software and processing fee other line, and I think we've given good, clear guidance on Charles River. And like you say, you just have to be careful about the annualization of the processing fees and other. I think just this quarter, processing fees and other were up about $25 higher than would have naturally been expected than a year ago quarter-over-quarter. And if you look at the full year, I think there's that or even a little more in full year 2019 than in full year 2018. So you may want to think about annualizing either both 2018 and 2019 or even look back to 2018 just because there's a range of possibilities there. James Mitchell : Okay, all to the point, appreciate the color. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Your line is now open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. A quick question on the guidance, you did mention that there was changes in leverage ratio coming forward, SCB could also be coming through, has any of that been that factored into the guidance or if those came through positively, that would all be incremental to the guidance you gave? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. Oh, that's a hard question because if I answer it, I'm going to show all my cards, and I can't show all my cards. I don't know what the CCAR cards are going to be like. And so that's a tough one. I think what we do now is we know the amount of capital returns last year. We have some amount of view on this coming year, but we're still guessing. And so I -- it's -- I think what you should probably do from a modeling perspective and what we would expect you to do is think about the capital return levels that we've been at last year as at least a starting point. I'll let you take a swag if you wanted to add a little more or not at that. But at least start with last year as I think that gives some earnings accretion to the EPS line because of the retirement of shares, and that should factor into your estimates in our -- that does factor into your estimates presumably in our guidance. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then separately, when you mentioned the pricing headwinds in 2020 of 3%, is 3% the new normal? Or do you still expect that to go back towards the 2% level of a headwind that has been historically? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. That's a hard question to answer now. I think we'll have a better sense of that later this year in 2020 because what we will get to is where are we with clients with whom we need to adjust pricing in 2017 and 2018 or '16, some of those. They tend to be 3-, 5-, 7-year contracts. There'll be some that start to come through. I think there'll be some balance of trade discussions with those clients. There'll be some different types of deals we do in 2020 and 2021. Think about the front-to-back deals have kind of a different patina to them, whether they come with more middle office or sometimes with a broader array of services that may not factor in differently. So I think it's just early to tell. I will certainly, I'm sure at this point next year, give some kind of indication for 2021. I think we'd like it to come back down to 2%, but we don't want to build a business model to that right now, which is probably why we've been so emphatic about notwithstanding the fee growth that we're expecting this year that we continue to want to reduce expenses in this plan. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Michael Carrier : Thanks, just a quick one for me. You mentioned in the quarter some market-related adjustments in software fees, curious just what that was and if material and then in the 1Q fee outlook, what was the client mix item that you highlighted? Eric Aboaf : Sure. It's Eric, Mike. Let me take the first part of that. On the market-related items in the software and processing fees, there are several -- the larger ones are tied around the asset management business where there are kind of two underlying activities. There's an activity where we seed funds with our own capital. And obviously, if those funds do well or if there's an equity market uptake, you tend to have a positive mark-to-market because they're effectively on our balance sheet. The second one is we've got some compensation programs that tied -- that are tied to different investment vehicles. And because of how the accounting works those, and again, tied, it's, I think, relatively typical in asset management because the way the accounting works is you tend to have a mark-to-market effect and an accrual effect, but they tend to be at -- in different time periods. And so in appreciating markets as we had this year, they tend to be positive. In falling markets like we had at the very end of fourth quarter of 2018, they were negative, and that's why we have a big swing. Those are the -- there are a couple of other smaller ones, but those are the lumpy items that we just effectively need to live with. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Mike, it's Ron. I'll pick up the second part of your question there. There -- we have a very large client where we do -- we have a comprehensive asset management relationship with them and like lots of other -- it's a large corporate. As it's derisking, it moves from risk on type of assets, which have a higher fee to fixed income and liability-driven kinds of investments, which have a lower fee. And this client happens to be large enough that it will be meaningful, assuming it takes place as we expect sometime in early 2020. Michael Carrier : Alright, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Michael Mayo : Hi, I have one question that addresses the headwind and one for the solution. So first, in terms of the problem pricing pressure, which you addressed, you said it's gone from 4% headwind to 3% headwind, maybe not 2%, but a little bit better. I guess isn't some of that improvement due to the runoff of low-margin BlackRock? And if you have assets to be installed equal to 3.5% of AUC, is that why you are conservatively guiding for 1% to 3% fee growth? And if the pricing pressure is really abating on a core level, why is that? Eric Aboaf : Mike, it's Eric. I think there are a couple of different pieces there on the pricing pressure. I think we try to be real distinct in our -- certainly internal analysis, but also our disclosure around pricing pressure relative to other drivers of the fee -- the servicing fee line. So the other drivers are net new business, which would include client transition or added business. There is -- we talked about flows and activity, which have been relatively modest. And then we talk about markets. So we talk about the different buckets consciously because it helps us better manage. And I think if you go through some of the description that I gave, the fee headwind, we do expect to be lighter from 4% this past year-over-year. In 2020, we expect it to be closer to 3%. I think we do expect some market uplift in 2020. That's in contrast to effectively no market uplift in 2019 if you look at the averages and you look at the averages around the world and average those. And then on net new business, which would include some of that, either added clients or the occasional transition out, we do expect that, that would be a bit positive in 2020 based on some of the last year of significant wins. And in 2019, to your point, it was actually flat in effect, and that was because of that client transition. So that's a little bit of a compare and contrast. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Mike, on your question on fee pressure itself, maybe the better way to describe it is we see the effects of the pressure abating. I mean at some level, clients, of course, want to have the best fee proposition that they can. We've gotten better at managing that, and we've gotten better through the addition of additional services like Charles River and the Alpha platform of being able to respond to a fee reduction with a -- with either a consolidation of business, offsetting new business, a deeper and broader share of the wallet. So maybe the way to think about it is there's always ongoing fee pressure. And at times, that's higher or lower, but it's always there. In the meantime, we've gotten better at managing it, both in terms of how we actually go about managing, but also in terms of the additional services that we can now bring to bear. Michael Mayo : And then part of the solution to that, as you've mentioned, is getting more efficient, reduced headcount 4 quarters in a row and really technology. So I know you just hired a new Chief Technology Officer, but if you could just give some sense of your technology priorities last year. Tech spending, I guess, went up 4% to $2.1 billion. Where do you expect the tech spend to go? And I know I've asked this. I asked this at the Annual Meeting last year, but you ended the decade with a 26% pretax margin and it was 29% when you first converted to the cloud. Just -- and this predates you, Ron, predates you, Eric. But when you look back at that and you say, okay, what are you going to do different the next few years that you maybe should have done or State Street should have done earlier last decade? Ronald P. O'Hanley: So there's a lot in your question, Mike, and let me try and answer it efficiently. The focus last year was on, firstly, being ruthless in our prioritization of what was important and trying it much more closely to the needs of the business, firstly, our clients; secondly, what we needed to do for our operating model; and thirdly, what we needed to do for ongoing -- improving ongoing operational resiliency. We're very careful about the incremental investments we make, what we need to make incremental investments. That has set us up. That -- if you will, the actions we took in 2019 have set us up now to be focused on what we think are the right priorities. We let go some personnel that we felt just weren't consistent with the priorities that we've set. And now what we need to do is just get better at executing those priorities. We feel we've got a plan in place to do that. So what we told you is that you've seen our historic growth. Our intention is to bend that expense growth just like we've bent overall expense growth. We'll do that through a combination of continuing to reprioritize. The gross impact of that will be reasonably high, but it'll be offset by the investments that we need to make to continue to be positioned the way we want to be with our clients. So the net result of that will be a significant arresting of the growth, but we'll probably still be slightly up for the year, is the way I would think about it. Michael Mayo : Okay. So total tech spend should increase what, like 1%, 2%, any numbers or just a little bit higher? Eric Aboaf : No, let me just clarify. We were very clear in December that our tech spend has been, this past year, 2018 to 2019, has been up, right, and up way too high in the high single digits at the 8% to 9% range. And our plan this year, which is factored into the outlook, is to have tech be flat to down 2%. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Yes. And that would be done, which I think is important to understand, through just like we manage overall expenses there'll be some gross reduction in tech spending, offset by a lower amount of tech investments to get us to a flat to slightly down kind of spending. Michael Mayo : Got it, alright, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Robert Wildhack : Morning guys. Ron, in December, you highlighted some hiring to target growth in the asset owner space. Can you talk about the competitive dynamics in that business and any differences from the asset manager side? And is that something you're emphasizing as a real strategic priority in the near and medium term? Ronald P. O'Hanley: So Rob, we are emphasizing that as a priority for a couple of reasons. Firstly, lots of the capabilities that we have are increasingly relevant to that space. The asset owner space in the distant past was much more of a custody only, maybe a little bit of accounting. And increasingly, asset owners of typical large and medium asset owner, firstly, is some form of an asset allocator. And in many cases, they have their own investment activities, alongside what they're doing with third parties. So it lends itself to the array of services that we have. The cycle time on them tends to be a little bit quicker, but it's a different selling cycle. If it involves public, it's a very prescribed selling cycle. So it's something that we believe we can leverage a lot of the capabilities that we have. And it's not like we're not present in that business already, but we believe there's opportunity to grow share as those -- that segment needs more and more of the distinct capabilities that we have. Robert Wildhack : Got it. And then on the asset management side, there's obviously been some consolidation in the e-broker space. And I believe there was some speculation that this could have an impact on distribution of State Street products. Do you think that's the case? And maybe more generally, can you discuss how you're thinking about your distribution strategy as that landscape keeps evolving? Ronald P. O'Hanley: That's a good question. And there's -- I think that, that's -- we're still in early stages in that. I mean at one level, it leveled the playing field for distribution. So for those that were, in some way, sharing revenues are paying to be on platforms when it goes to 0, you don't write checks anymore for that. So it's -- in some cases, for us and others, we're not the only ones that's reduced our expenses. But it's also -- it's harder to get -- it's harder to pay for now a distinctive positioning. But we do think it will cause is -- with, if you will, transaction fees, no longer the primary criterion by many investors, we believe that it's going to -- that it should enable us to point investors to what they should be focused on, which is liquidity of the product, the true cost of moving in and out of the product. And we've got -- and despite a range, we've got some of the most actively traded products out there. Very liquid. In some cases, deeper and more liquid than the underlying assets. So we think this is an opportunity for us to actually focus on the liquidity side, the importance of that for our investors. But early, early days in this. Robert Wildhack : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Ron and Eric. Ron, can you share with us -- you talked earlier about business wins, and there's been a whole mix of different products that you succeeded with this past year. Can you talk to the front-to-back business wins which is new because of Charles River, what types of customers are you seeing grab on to that type of full array of products, is it a completely new customer, or is it no existing customers that are now willing to give you that opportunity to go front to back? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Gerard, the pipeline is -- we're pleased about the pipeline, is that it's a true mix of clients. We would have expected that our existing clients are a client where we had a large position already, and therefore, in daily conversations with them would be interested in this. And that certainly has played out. And in most of the instances kind in 2019, there were some existing relationship. But what's been particularly gratifying is that we have in the pipeline and working very much through them towards what we would expect to see mandate signed in 2020 or early 2021. Clients where we had no relationship or just a very, very minor relationship where they see the advantage of being able to have a platform, and it might be all State Street products or might not, but a platform that integrates it all there and give them the ability to reengineer their own business model. It's led to, as I said earlier, a -- just an entirely different set of conversations with clients. It's not about we'll do custody for you at a fraction at this point lower than your guide, and it's much more about what are you trying to achieve in your business, [indiscernible]. Interestingly, as you'd expect, some of the clients in the pipeline are those that are challenged by the environment. Others are those that are already winning in the environment and are trying to figure out how they're going to be able to scale for the next 5 or 10 years. So it's a rich mix of clients, and we think has a -- just a very, very large potential for us as we go forward. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then maybe, Eric, I know there's been a lot of talk on the call about the pricing pressure that you guys have seen, it went up to 4%. Now it seems to be coming in a little bit, and you talked about the mix of your business, repricing, which may be contributing to the reduction. Can you talk to the pricing competition, though? Are you finding that your competitors are less price competitive than maybe two or three years ago or has it really remained unabated? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it's Eric. I think it's actually a mix of competitors, in some cases, and clients and others that actually drive the pricing headwinds. And so if you think about it, we are the largest of the providers, so the asset manager segment in the U.S. and around the world as a custodian and fund accountant. And I think it's those clients, the asset manager clients, in particular, that have actually borne the brunt of some of the challenges in the investment industry. And so in some ways, we're near to the bull's eye of where there's disruption in the investment industry, and that's been why I think we've been disproportionately impacted. It's kind of the effect of having that larger share position. I think we've always seen competitors come in and out of our industry, certainly, those in the other segments, our MBS, of our position, asset managers, but I don't think it's as much a competition-driven change. There's always some of that, but I don't think it's as much of that. And I tell you, for every large competitor that's in the ascent, there's a large competitor who's beginning to fade and focus on other areas, or sometimes there's a small disruptor coming in. There are other small players deciding that there are other areas to refocus. So I think a little more client-driven than otherwise. Gerard Cassidy : Well thank you and appreciate the time that you spent on the call. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Ron O'Hanley for closing comments. A - Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks very much, everybody, for your participation and your interest.

State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street's website. Now, I would like to introduce Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street. Ilene Bieler : Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our first quarter 2020 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that exclude or adjust one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-Q. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald O'Hanley: Thanks Ilene and good morning everyone. You will have seen that today, we released our first quarter earnings results. I am pleased with our performance during such turbulent times, and I am proud of our team members worldwide who achieved these results. The COVID-19 health crisis has necessitated a rapid curtailment of economic activity, which in turn has driven significant financial market volatility and a lack of liquidity in some fixed income markets. The markets in general and State Street specifically, have withstood the volatility well. Central banks moved quickly to help alleviate market stress and State Street's long-standing business continuity planning, supplemented by rapid innovation, has enabled us to operate, protect our employees, and serve our clients exceptionally well. Throughout this period, we have continued to execute against our strategy, which is reflected in our strong performance. Before discussing our quarterly financial performance, I want to review some of the actions that we have taken in support of our clients and to protect the safety of our global workforce, all while remaining focused on State Street's operational excellence, resiliency and business performance. Turning to slide three, I will outline some of the key aspects of State Street's response to the pandemic. As a global company operating in 29 countries, we have been addressing the coronavirus since its very inception with significant operations and approximately 3,000 employees in China, we had somewhat of a head start on adapting our global operating model to the rapidly changing needs of our clients as well as to the safety concerns of our approximately 39,000 employees across the globe. Our actions in response to this global health crisis have centered on maintaining employee safety and business continuity and resilience, while concurrently supporting our clients, the financial markets, and the broader economy. Let me start with our people. Here, our Senior Global Crisis Team has worked continuously since mid-January with local management and relevant authorities across the world to safeguard employee health and wellbeing. Our IT capabilities rapidly allowed us to add capacity for remote access solutions, while also maintaining cyber safety. And today, approximately 90% of our global workforce is working from home. We announced that through the end of the year, we suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID-19 crisis. I believe this is the right decision for our people, our clients and our communities. It aligns with our culture and values and reflects our financial strength. We are undertaking actions to offset the cost of this decision, which we will describe later in the presentation. Let me turn to our clients in the broader markets. The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the pace and timing of an economic recovery will influence investor behavior, financial market conditions, and our clients, who are the owners and managers of the world capital. State Street plays a central role in the infrastructure of the global financial system. This crisis has demonstrated our deep operational capabilities at a time of significantly increased business volumes. Our global operating model has enabled us to run split operations where we can efficiently transfer work with minimal disruption to client service at a time when we have seen a significant expansion in activity. For example, in March, we experienced a 50% increase in back-office transactions and an over 80% increase in middle office transactions. Similarly, valuation checks for NAV calculations due to significant asset price moves, which typically run at approximately $70,000 per day; it is high as $1 million per day at the height of the market volatility. Due to the scale and reach of the current COVID-19 crisis, asset owners and asset managers have been impacted globally with many struggling to cope with market disruptions, reduced workforces, limited access to normal workplace infrastructure, and continuing uncertainty. To assist these clients, we have focused on a number of priorities during the last few weeks. First, we have increased our level of client engagement and communication ensuring we better understand client needs and how we can rapidly assist them in this unique and challenging environment. Second, we are maintaining a state of operational readiness through increased IT resource capacity with strong and tested business continuity plans put into action, as I mentioned earlier. Third, we are providing a suite of liquidity solutions. State Street has a range of short-term cash investment options for our clients, including deposits, centrally clear repo and access to a full range of money market funds via our investment portal Fund Connect. Global Advisors also has a number of specialized cash strategies. In addition, our global credit finance team supports clients with overdraft capacity and committed lines of credit. We also stand ready to support the broader economy. State Street is actively assisting our clients to tap various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit, facilitating approximately 50% of money market mutual fund liquidity facility, or MMLF usage, while also serving as the custodian and accounting administrator for the commercial paper funding facility. Many clients appreciated that we worked closely with the Federal Reserve to set up the MMLF and enable clients to access liquidity even before it's fully operational, which helped clients stabilize their funds. As we look out over the longer term, the evolving needs of all of our clients are at the center of our strategy to continue to be our clients' essential partner and provide the technology and scale they need to grow when the current uncertainty dissipates and global macroeconomic conditions recover. We believe this crisis will only accelerate the desire of clients to outsource more of their operations and partner with a fully capable front-to-back provider like State Street. Turning to slide four, I am pleased by the direction and progress of our strategy as demonstrated by our strong first quarter performance. Relative to the prior year period, first quarter total revenue increased 5%, and on a sequential quarter basis, total revenue increased 1%. First quarter EPS was $1.62, up 37% year-over-year, and ROE was 10.9%. I am pleased to report that our first quarter pretax margin improved by over three percentage points to 25.6%, excluding notable items. Despite the unprecedented levels of equity market volatility during the first quarter, our results benefited from the relatively stable domestic equity market averages relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. Market averages were materially higher than the year ago period as a result of the dramatic global equity market sell-off in late 2018. Industry flows were positive in aggregate as investors move from long mutual fund positions into ETFs and money market bonds. At State Street, we saw a particularly strong recovery in U.S. flows relative to the first quarter of 2019. While FX volatility remained at low levels for the first half of the quarter, our results, ultimately, benefited from materially higher levels of FX volatility experienced during the latter half of the quarter and the market tumult associated with COVID-19. That volatility, plus our multi-year innovation investments, led to record FX results. First quarter NII benefited from significantly higher deposit levels as clients turn to us as part of their flight to quality, despite dramatic long and short end rate reductions. Assets under custody and administration fell 7% quarter-over-quarter to $31.9 trillion as a result of lower period end market levels. We saw a healthy level of new wins during the quarter, totaling $171 billion. Assets yet to be installed stood at $1.1 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, assets under management fell 14% quarter-over-quarter to $2.7 trillion as a result of lower period end equity market levels. Global advisers recorded $39 billion of total net inflows during the first quarter, the highest quarter of net inflows in a year. Net inflows were driven by strong inflows in cash and good inflows in the institutional business, as clients turned to State Street's offerings in a time of turmoil. After experiencing net outflows in January and February, I would note that March was a particularly strong month for our ETF business, with our SPDR suite of ETF gathering more than $20 billion in net inflows. Aided by the integration of Charles River Development, we continue to see that our front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients and building on this remains a key focus for us in 2020. We signed a large sovereign wealth fund as a front-to-back client in quarter one. The front-to-back State Street Alpha pipeline is developing and advancing well with a good mix of deal sizes, functionality and scope. Turning to expenses, first quarter total expenses were down 1% relative to the year ago period, excluding notable items. We are building on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during 2019, when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency, and reduce expenses through a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program. Today, we are more focused than ever on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits, as we strengthen our operating model, even during this unprecedented period. In addition, as a result of the current environment and our decision to suspend workforce reductions, we are taking additional expense actions, including a hiring freeze for non-critical operational positions. We also continue to very carefully manage all discretionary expenses. To conclude, while we cannot predict the scope and duration of the pandemic and the associated economic impact, we will remain very, focused on three core priorities. First, supporting our employees and our communities, second, providing service and operational excellence to our clients, and third, driving value for our shareholders. While the markets may be unpredictable, we are well prepared to navigate this volatility with a strong balance sheet, capital position and proven operational capabilities. We at State Street remain outward looking, globally connected and laser-focused on helping our clients achieve better investment outcomes for the people they serve. State Street has navigated through good times and bad times for our clients for over two centuries and this moment will be no different. We stand ready to support our clients and our global workforce in any capacity we can. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. To start my review of our first quarter results, I'd like to go to slide five, where you can see, we reported EPS of $1.62, up 37% year-over-year. On the top left panel, I would call your attention to two items. First, our FX trading business had extraordinary quarter, generating revenues of $459 million of record volumes and increased client demand, which I'll spend more time discussing shortly. And second, we had a $36 million provision expense with a sequential increase driven largely by the effects of the COVID-19, on our economic forecast. On the top right panel, we had $11 million of expected pretax acquisition and restructuring charges, primarily related to Charles River as well as $9 million of after-tax costs associated with the redemption of our Series C preferred securities.  On the bottom left panel, we show our quarterly results, ex-notable items for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends. I would also note that we were able to generate positive operating leverage in the first quarter, helping to improve our first quarter 2020 pretax margin year-over-year. Turning to slide six, period end, AUC/A levels decreased 2% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter. Year-over-year, AUC/A were affected by a previously announced client transition that had a deminimis effect on year-on-year revenues. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC/A decrease were mainly due to lower end-of-period equity market levels. As a reminder, approximately half of our AUC/A is reported on a one month lag, so some of the impact of the equity sell off seen in March has not yet reflected the year. AUM levels decreased 4% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter to $2.7 trillion, driven largely by lower end-of-period market levels, partially offset by strong net inflows over both time periods. Amidst the extraordinary market conditions for asset managers in the first quarter, State Street global advisers saw net inflows of $39 billion, largely driven by cash and institutional inflows. Unpacking the first quarter, AUM trends a bit, it was a tale of January and February versus March as after seeing modest net outflows in the first two months of the quarter, Global Advisors saw strong inflows of approximately $45 billion in March with $27 billion in cash inflows and $23 billion in ETFs. Global Advisors saw strong inflows of more than $10 billion in March alone into SPY, our premier S&P 500 ETF offering, and the largest and most liquid product in its class. Moving to slide seven, servicing fees were up 3% year-on-year as the core business continued to regain momentum and down 1% quarter-on-quarter on lower equity markets. As Ron said, the investment services business saw significantly elevated client activity inflows during the quarter, particularly in March and successfully navigated the activity with minimal service disruptions. Through this stressed environment, we believe clients realize, perhaps more than ever the value of our scale and capabilities during exceptionally challenging market conditions. By way of an example, a number of our asset manager clients have expressed gratitude for their partnership with State Street and the fact that our investment servicing business has worked tirelessly to ensure that their fund investors are able to buy, sell, and monitor their fund performance, both accurately and timely, which gives them the strong sense of confidence they deserve. On the bottom right panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators that underlying this dynamic. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $131 billion in the first quarter with several deals coming through the pipeline in late March. We do expect to see some near-term slowdown in sales, but assets to be installed as of the first quarter period end is strong at $1.1 trillion, and we still expect fee pressure to remain moderated as it has in recent quarters. Turning to slide eight, let me discuss the other fee revenue lines. Beginning with management fees, first quarter revenues were up 7% year-on-year, but down 3% quarter-on-quarter, driven by lower average market levels and mix changes away from higher fee institutional products, partially offset by positive mix changes in ETFs. As I mentioned earlier, FX trading services were up 64% year-on-year and 68% quarter-on-quarter as the business saw record volumes and increased client demand given market volatility amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, something I'll be discussing more -- in more detail shortly. Securities Finance revenues were down 22% year-on-year as investor asset mix shifted towards lower spread fixed income assets and as hedge fund deleveraging in foreign markets drove down the enhanced custody demand. Revenues were down 17% quarter-on-quarter due to similar factors. Finally, software and processing fees were down 41% year-on-year and 49% quarter-on-quarter. As you know, this line includes certain business revenues such as CRD software fees, as well as other lumpy items, such as the amortization of tax advantaged investments, certain currency translation impacts, and the mark-to-market adjustment on the employee long-term incentive plans. These other items are worth about $65 million negative this quarter as opposed to the usual slight positive. Moving to slide nine, we wanted to provide some incremental color around the extraordinary quarter we saw on the FX trading franchise. For several quarters now, we've been highlighting that our FX business had been confronting historically low volatility levels, but that we have been focused on expanding the client base and building share of wallet, while reinvesting in our broad set of platforms. This quarter, we are thus, well-positioned to support our clients' needs as volumes and volatilely level surged to the COVID-19 pandemic, spurring elevated client demand across our various FX trading venues. As you can see, the FX sales and trading business, including direct FX and custody FX, saw a 40% increase in volumes from average levels, while our FX trading platforms, including FX Connect and Currenex saw a 50% increase in volumes over the same period. On the right-hand side of this page, we've included the most recent Euromoney Rankings related to the FX business, including its number one ranking for real money asset managers for two years in a row to give you a sense of the depth and breadth of this important franchise. Moving to slide 10, you'll see in the top left panel a five quarter summary of CRD's stand-alone revenue and pretax income. For first quarter, CRD generated standalone revenue of $100 million, which was up 1% year-on-year and down 21% quarter-on-quarter. I would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards and to not read across any one quarter's results. Having said that, we do expect some disruption and updates in professional services fees over the coming months as on-site activity is currently somewhat curtailed. On the right panel, we've again included some texture around the momentum we're seeing in the business and how the integration is progressing. We continue to remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition. Turning to slide 11, NII was down 1% year-on-year, but up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential increase in NII was primarily driven by increased deposit balances and episodic market-related benefits of approximately $20 million, partially offset by long-term debt issuance costs. Average assets were up as average deposits increased 10% quarter-on-quarter from fourth quarter 2019, with period end deposits increasing 41% quarter-on-quarter as we saw a wave of flight-to-quality client deposits surge at the end of March, particularly from asset managers. We were there to support our clients. We've since seen deposit levels receipt somewhat in April, but they still remain elevated versus 4Q 2019 levels. End-of-period assets were also driven off by $27 billion as we help clients access the Fed's new money market mutual fund liquidity facility or MMLF. State Street facilitated just over 50% of the MMLF volume as we asserted our leadership role in supporting our clients and the smooth functioning of markets. Moving to slide 12, we've included some color here on the loan portfolio as well as the company's allowance for credit losses. As you know, State Street's loan portfolio is relatively small, typically 10% or so of average assets and generally consist of high-quality and conservatively underwritten mix of fund finance, leveraged loans, commercial real estate and municipal loans. On the right panel of this page, we've included some incremental detail around the loan book and its characteristics. In the current environment, I'd note a few highlights as of first quarter. Approximately 91% of the book is investment grade with 84% of the on-balance sheet exposure to investment-grade and 98% of the off-balance sheet exposures. The leverage loan portfolio of approximately $4 billion has relatively low exposure to cyclical factors currently in focus and has an average rating of BB, which is stronger than the traditional index. Compared to 4Q 2019, average loans grew 12%, while period-end loans grew 23%, primarily driven by elevated client overdrafts as we help clients facilitate the higher settlement of trades and FX activities during March. These overdrafts have already receded in April. Moving to the bottom left panel, the total allowance for credit losses increased by $35 million to $124 million as we added to reserves, largely related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the end of March economic forecast. On slide 13, we've again provided a view of expenses this quarter, ex-notables, so that the underlying trends are really visible. Our first quarter 2020 expenses excluding notable items and seasonal expenses were down 2% year-over-year, driven by resource discipline and reengineering efforts and down 2% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by the timing of foundation funding, lower travel and lower professional expenses. We continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year and believe that taken together these various efforts position us to navigate the extraordinary market conditions seen in recent weeks and meet our expense goals. We're making good progress in lowering compensation and benefits costs, occupancy costs and other costs and IT costs are lumpy but on track too. Given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on revenue, we obviously need to begin to intervene further on expenses and now expect to take them down 1% to 2% for the full year. This won't be easy, but we've begun to accelerate our plans and we'll adjust as we know more. First, as Ron mentioned earlier, for the remainder of the year unless the crisis concludes earlier, we will suspend most workforce reductions. We also instituted a hiring freeze for non-critical positions. Second, we see opportunities to dig deeper in non-compensation expenses, such as occupancy, contractors, travel and other professional fees. Third, we will be judicious about the reinvestments needed to drive growth in our business. And finally, we will adjust as the situation develops. Moving to slide 14, you can see that we maintained strong capital and liquidity levels during the first quarter with our standardized CET1 ratio, which was binding for first quarter ending at 10.7% and our LCR ratio essentially flat quarter-on-quarter. As you can see in the middle right panel, our SLR and Tier 1 leverage ratios ended at 5.4% and 6.1% respectively, with the sequential decline largely driven by an influx of flight-to-quality client deposits. We have the room to support our client activity under both ratios, especially given that the SLR would have been 7.1% post-implementation of Section 402 on April 1. During the quarter, we returned a total of approximately $683 million of capital to shareholders, including $500 million in share repurchases before we acting in coordination with other sub members of the Financial Services Forum agreed to temporarily suspend our repurchases in second quarter. We remain confident in our robust capital levels and our ongoing ability to continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our clients, the financial markets and the broader economy. Turning to slide 15 now, we've provided a summary of our first quarter results. As we mentioned earlier, throughout this crisis, we have been differentiating ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients for these difficult times. Our resiliency during heightened volatility and our ability to execute record volumes without sacrificing service quality has created goodwill with our clients as we look to the future in the post COVID-19 time period. That said the potential length and depth of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy has made the operating environment uncertain. This uncertainty, obviously, introduces a higher than usual degree of variability into our financial outlook. However, I would like to share our current expectations for the remainder of 2020 under a certain set of assumptions. While we believe these are reasonable set of assumptions, there is a broad range of possibilities regarding the potential length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale the economic impacts. As such, the current expectations we are providing today will represent one potential range of outcomes, but they are not representative of the full range of potential outcomes that may actually occur. So, with a very difficult second quarter economic situation in front of us, we assume global central banks keep short-term rates low and that long end rates then flowed up to about 80 basis points by year-end. We assume equity levels in second quarter to be consistent with March averages and potentially float up in the second half of the year. This will leave average equity market levels for 2020 lower as compared to 2019. Given these significant changes to the economic outlook, we currently expect that fee revenue will be down 1% to 2% year-on-year for full year 2020. Looking at the component pieces of our fee revenue; let me go through each one. Beginning with servicing fees, we expect they will be down 1% to 3%, driven largely by lower-than-expected market averages. We continue to see good underlying health and momentum in the servicing business, although there may be a slight slowdown in the sales pipeline over the near-term as clients adjust the new operating environment. Moving to management fees, we would expect now that they will be down 3% to 5% year-on-year, depending on equity market performance. I included in this outlook, the zero interest rate environment introduces the likelihood of money market fund fee waivers, which are highly sensitive to short-term rates and could have a modest impact of approximately $10 million to $40 million on our business, largely in the second half of the year. Our markets businesses will continue to be informed by the trading environment. We expect the spike in FX trading revenues will subside with market volumes and volatility, while securities finance will continue to be impacted by lower levels of leverage. Within software and processing fees, we remain confident in the CRD deal synergies. However, the uncertainty and the operational pressures introduced by the COVID-19 pandemic on the front office clients is now expecting to create go-live delays and slow down professional services projects of several current CRD clients. As a result, we now expect CRD revenue to be up mid-single-digit percentages year-on-year for full year 2020. At this time, we would expect software and processing fees ex-CRD, to likely be between $60 million and $70 million per quarter for the rest of the year, absent any further significant market-related adjustments. Regarding the second quarter of 2020, on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down 5% to 9% depending on our much lower equity market levels. The servicing fees towards the minus 5% end of the range, management fees coming in towards the minus 9% end of the range and considering some reversion in the trading revenues. Regarding NII, we still expect to be down approximately 10% year-on-year for full year 2020, as I previously indicated in mid-March, primarily driven by the impact of lower rates and the relatively strong performance in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we currently expect NII to be down about 11% quarter-on-quarter ex-episodic items, driven by the full quarter impact of lower rates. We expect NII to stabilize by the fourth quarter. Turning to expenses, even during this unprecedented period, we remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and automation benefits. We expect that full year expenses, ex-notable items, will now be down 1% to 2%, exceeding our original goal of down 1%, as I mentioned earlier. In regards to our provision expense, 2Q results will be driven by updated economic forecast embedded in our new CECL models, plus any specific reserves. At the end of March, we assumed a number of factors in a range of scenarios for our general reserve. Among those numerous inputs, our dominant scenario had 2Q GDP of minus 12% and full year GDP of minus 2%. Had we moved to a different dominant scenario where full year GDP was minus 6%, for example, than we would have roughly built an additional $50 million of reserves. I'm simplifying, of course, and there are dozens of important variables, but this example gives you a taste of the sensitivity of the CECL reserving process to potential economic scenarios. On taxes, we continue to expect that we will land within the previously provided range of 17% to 19% for a tax rate for the full year, though some discrete items are expected to drive down that rate by about four percentage points lower for second quarter. And finally, we've again included our previously disclosed medium-term financial targets in our earnings presentation this morning because we believe they are the right targets. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of its impacts, raises the question regarding the timing of when we might realize those targets, which were set on a run rate basis for 2022. We are not changing the timing at this point, but we'll continue to monitor the length of the COVID-19 anticipated impact closely going forward. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alexander Blostein : Great. Great. Good morning, everybody. Eric, thanks for the updated detailed guidance. I guess first question maybe around deposits. So below March levels, but above, I guess, you said fourth quarter, obviously, it's a really wide spread there. So, maybe just give us a flavor for where deposits currently stay in April, sort of on average? And then importantly, as you guys think about the capacity to absorb any additional deposits or sustain the current levels, how should we think of that with respect to your capital leverage ratios? How much lower you guys would be able to take that? Eric Aboaf : Alex, its Eric. Let me start on the deposits and just give you a little bit of texture on the trends, because I think that, that would help you. And obviously, the deposit levels move quite a bit. If you recall, back in fourth quarter, our deposit levels were about $165 billion in aggregate. And in January and February, they were literally just spot on to those averages. What started to change was the surge we saw at the beginning of March. And so, if we just think about the first half of March, we're running at about $185 billion of average total deposits. The second half of March spiked to $235 billion, and that together is what got us to a -- drove the higher averages for the quarter. And I think you saw our end-of-period print was north of $250 billion. And we literally operated at that level of deposits for about a week at the very end of the quarter. In terms of today, they\u2019ve been running somewhere around $200 billion, $210 billion, so still hefty and I'll call kind of risk off levels. We're seeing that flight in [[h] quality and we're certainly there to support our clients. We do expect them to ebb down. And I think the question is, what's the pace of that? Do we get a resurgence or not? But there's a range of scenarios. What I would say is that the deposits now are a facilitation, a way for us to facilitate the needs of our clients, right? We're there for them on overdrafts, we're there for them on deposits, we're there for them on repo, we're there for them on supporting them at the Fed facilities, and I think we're delighted to do that as much as possible. In terms of the capacity, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we've got ample capacity at these levels of deposits to support our clients. You see our capital ratios, whether it's the SLR, post the April 1 change is quite high. And that can -- that's at -- on a reported -- on the new basis were about 7% against the 5% level. You see Tier 1 leverage. We still ran well this quarter, and that's against a 4% minimum. So, there's certainly some range. There's not unlimited range, but our perspective is that, if deposits stay in the asset levels that they are at today, the kind of $200 billion to $210 billion that's quite comfortable for us and we're here to do what we need to for our clients. Alexander Blostein : Got it. That's helpful detail. Thanks for that. And then my second question is around CRD. So, revenue is about $100 million in the first quarter that's up only 1%, I guess, year-over-year. I think that business has been growing in the kind of high single-digit range, and you guys are obviously hoping to increase that further. So, is that sort of the impact of COVID-19 already playing out in the first quarter results? And that's really kind of the slowdown? Or is there something else going on? And I guess, as you look at the pipeline and the front-to-back wins that you guys have been highlighting over the last couple of quarters, any way to help us frame kind of the revenue backlog in that part of the business in timing to recognize it, understanding that, obviously, the current events could move that timing up and down, but just hoping to get some flavor there? Thanks. Ronald O'Hanley: Alex, let me start on that, and then I'll turn it over to Eric. We remain very pleased with the impact that CRD is having on our business. The front-to-back pipeline continues to grow, and it's having CRD as part of that toolbox, if you will. And as I've mentioned before, in some cases, we don't end up, in the end with a full front to back, but we end up with a built-out relationship or even a relationship that we didn't have before. For example, the one front-to-back win that we had this quarter -- that we announced this quarter. It was not even an existing client of either CRD or State Street. So, from an overall enhanced State Street value proposition that's working well. As Eric noted, the reported revenues are very, very sensitive to the accounting rules and the accounting treatment. And we did -- it's very sensitive to when we're delivering things and if delivery gets changed or if the contours of something gets changed, it does affect the timing of reported revenue. So, strategically, this remains a very important and integral business for us. It's driving a lot of new activity. It's driving activity into the profitable back office for us. So, we remain unchanged, and it's important to us strategically. And Eric can talk about the actual financial impact that you're -- in your question? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Alex, its Eric. So the quarterly revenues are always lumpy, and I'll just remind you that for a midsized client will bring in when it's on an on-premise basis, potentially $5 million, $10 million in a potential installation when it goes live. The smaller clients obviously, are $1 million, $2 million, $3 million. And so you can see, on a base of $100 million, you've got -- we could see big swings in growth rates, positive or negative. So I wouldn't read too much into that. What we have done is started to think through the likely revenues for the business this year. And this business in contrast to our servicing fee business, has more on-site kind of work that needs to be done. If there's on-site sort of co-development to integrate our platform within asset managers, there's professional services billings that also go with that. So, between the professional services billings just being slowed down with work from home, and then the go-live dates likely to be pushed out. I don't think there'll be -- we don't expect them to not be there, but we do expect some lengthening of those go-live dates. We're now looking at revenue growth at about 5%, 6%. We said mid-single-digits as opposed to the low-double-digits that we had expected this year. And we think that's mostly going to be around timing as opposed to underlying performance. The pipeline in CRD specifically is healthy. It's continued at the levels that it had been just a few months ago. And the interest in securing mandates from our clients, we think, it's actually as strong as ever. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : Next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Quick question on the loan book. So, I heard you loud and clear. Thank you on -- what the environment you underwrote to and what it could be in a worse environment in second quarter. So, it's -- I'm trying to think through -- if you look at the composition of loan book, fund finance and overdrafts, they don't scare me much. And my gut is not much of the reserves are focused on that. So, is it correct to say that most of the reserving goes towards the $4 billion levered loans and the $2 billion commercial real estate? And I'm just curious if you can contextualize a little bit more about quality of those portfolios. Specifically because what you said looks good, but 36%, 50%, it starts adding up in terms of just reserving. That's all. Eric Aboaf : Glenn, its Eric. I think you've got the right frame of mind on the loan book, so a modest-sized loan book which is 10% of our total assets. And it's pretty diversified both across categories and then within categories. So, fund finance, as you mentioned, is primarily capital call finance loans with recourse to some of the largest in premier investors in the world, where -- that's a pretty attractive business area for us and one that's grown nicely. Leverage loans is an area that we -- obviously, in this environment, we'll spend a little extra time and I'll come back and talk about that in a moment and then commercial real estate overdraft munis are pretty straightforward. You are right to hypothesize that more than a majority of the reserves for our book is for the leverage loan book. And the reason we're reasonably comfortable with this book, do not have to say that things won't happen on an individual name here or there, is that it tends to be an upmarket book. Average rating is about BB as opposed to the average in the index is single B. And it's -- literally, the center of gravity is quite different. We've been tracking the market prices for this book. This book tends to have market prices as we've seen some change in the market to be six, seven points better than the typical -- than the average leverage loan index. So, it's performed well so far. And it's pretty well diversified. There aren't any particularly unusual exposures. There's not much oil and gas in it. So, we're -- we think it'll operate well during this time period. But I guess at the end of the day, it's a relatively high-grade version of leverage lending, and it's only $4 billion. And so we think it's -- it'll perform well and will just be a piece of the broader picture for the company. Glenn Schorr : Cool. I appreciate the perspective, one follow-up on just NII, overall. So keeping it at down 10 as the thought process for the year, but deposit book is a lot more. I'm just curious a lot of the deposits come in, in non-interest bearing. And so we'll see how long they sit there, but they're going to hang out for a little while, at least. I'm just curious, I know rates think, but we knew the rates were interesting. I'm curious why NII, with a greater deposit base wouldn't be a little bit less bad? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, its Eric. I think you said it right. I won't repeat the five-letter word you use. But prevailing interest rates at the Central Bank, if you think of IOER as a benchmark are remarkably low, right? They're at 10 basis points. So, if you think about it, whether we taken a deposit at zero or taking a deposit at one, there's very little spread there. And so the value of the deposits, while they're there for -- they're there on our balance sheet, and we can lend against them, we can use them to support our other books, they're transient, by and large. And the value is small relative to what it's been. If you think back to the first quarter, on average, first quarter deposits were worth roughly 100 basis points. Just think about the cost of funds versus the IOER rate. In the second quarter, we expect deposits across the spectrum to be worth a fraction that closer to 10 basis points. So, it's just in an order of magnitude difference. And so, while we'll have -- we may have a surge or higher levels of deposits, we'll not be particularly renumerative this time around. Glenn Schorr : I got it. I appreciate it and thanks for all the guidance. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to dig in a little bit on your expectation on trading revenue. I know you referenced Eric that you expect it to subside. But can you help us with magnitude? How should we think about the potential decline from what you did in 1Q? Are you really just sort of expecting it to revert back to what we saw kind of like last year run rate? Or how should we calibrate? And what should we watch for as the year progresses? Ronald O'Hanley: Brandon, that's a really good question and a real hard one to answer with any conviction. But let me share with you how we're thinking about it from a forecasting standpoint and then some of the possibilities. From a forecasting standpoint, our view is, by May and June, absent any other dramatic changes to the environment, the FX volumes will normalize back to what they were pre-crisis. And then that those levels, pre-crisis, will be what we should expect in third quarter and fourth quarter. Now, I'm saying all that, assuming that we have stability in equity markets, bond markets, global markets, and that's hard to predict. And, obviously, any further deterioration of the health situation or the economic situation is going to push us right back to where we were. So, -- and we're not hoping for that, we're hoping just for the opposite for the quieting of the enormous disruption that we've seen. All that said, there is a range of outcomes here, not just from the pandemic and its economic impact on markets like we saw in March. If we have a repeat of that in the coming months, and we could see some higher volumes again. But there's also a set of, if you think about the rest of the year, set of events, right? We've got Brexit continuing in some ways. We've got U.S. elections. We've done a series of different elements, I think, political, economic, global, world trade is going to come back at some point, and we'll have -- we may have tensions there. And so it's hard for me to really predict. And so, we tend to try to be careful with our forecast in FX, in particular, knowing that there certainly could be some upside. But I think we'll all see it when it happens and can probably factor that in. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then circling back as a follow-up to one of Glenn's questions on the loan book. Thanks for the additional disclosure there. The two biggest pieces are the fund finance and overdraft. Can you talk about any exposures that you might have in the fund finance book to mortgage REITs? What in that book makes you or your risk managers nervous, when they go to sleep at night? And obviously, it's not -- when we go into a market like this, it's not necessarily the stuff you always think that you need to worry about. Sometimes you get hit by surprise. So how can we -- how is it that you think about that book? How is it that, you risk managed? And how do you ensure that we don't end up in a situation, similar to what we had to a cycle where what we thought was good, like with the liquidity stops for the asset-backed commercial paper conduits, all of a sudden have become assets that end up coming back on the balance sheet and big headache to deal with. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Brennan, it's Eric. Let me give you a little bit of texture perhaps on what's included in the $13 billion of fund finance, and how we think about it. And you can imagine, over the last month, between finance and our risk organization and our business teams, we spent extra time. And heightening our oversight and monitoring. But let me describe for you what we have there, and kind of how we think about the -- each of those books and maintaining the quality that we like. So, within fund finance, the largest piece is capital call financing. That's literally lines to some of the premier investors around the world, and that's done on a -- that's been allocated on a fund-by-fund basis. But the work that was goes on behind the scenes is that, each of those funds as a set of investors behind it. And what we need to do is maintain a diversified group of leads to those investors. And we want to avoid all concentration. So, there's a lot of work that gets done as we grow that book to make sure that there aren't any unknown concentrations or the concentrations are all within limits, on a literally an investor-by-investor basis, because that's where we have recourse. So, that's the primary approach on the capital call financing. The next piece within fund finance is the 40 Act liquidity funds that -- these are the funds that can have a certain amount of leverage. They're very well described, I think, in the 40 Act rules and they have limits on the amount of leverage they can. And there, the monitoring is what the asset pool? It's effectively a version of margin lending. What's the underlying asset pool? What are the line sizes? How do we constrain those appropriately and have our limit structures? And then there is literally the daily monitoring of that leverage in that margining. So, that's pretty straightforward in some sense. But, just like you say, you never say, never. And so, there's extra oversight in these volatile times to measure and to monitor the underlying collateral literally on a daily basis, as you'd expect. And then the smallest piece within fund finance is the BDCs. It's just over $1 billion. It tends to be BDCs with BBB pools of underlying loans. And so there, it's about diversification of the BDCs. They tend to be from some of the most premier alternative asset manager providers, right? Some of our largest clients because that's who we're trying to support there. And there, it's about a set of size limits and ongoing monitoring. So, that's maybe a little bit of texture. I think like I guess the frame of reference I'd give you is each of these a little different, and each of these have a different level of monitoring. And the process now, I think, like any bank, but ours is kind of simpler and more vanilla than most banks is to see if there're any -- if margin changes more than expected, occasionally you get questions around the possibility of adjusting covenants, and that's -- that quickly escalates. So that we have to make sure that how we react to those proactively and consciously. And sometimes we grant those and sometimes we grant those and actually ask the borrower to reduce their leverage or their -- or our exposure to -- our exposure to them. And so there's a -- I'd say there's a very natural set of actions that we use, both on a monitoring and intervention basis on an ongoing basis. But let me pause there with at least that texture. Brennan Hawken : Yes thanks. That\u2019s great additional color. Appreciate it. Operator : -- comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could expand upon your comments you gave on CRD talking about that maybe the -- the cycle is a little bit slower there. Just in terms of your regular way servicing conversations that you're having with clients, giving the changes and how we're all working, how are those conversations going? Are -- does the -- how do you approach sales cycles? And moving forward with engagements that you've already been in process with in-sourcing new business? Thanks. Ronald O'Hanley: Yes, Ken, the -- I mean, the level of engagement remains high and has continued to be high, even during this last month, five weeks of -- with almost everybody in the world working from home. And in fact, a new very large situation developed right in the middle of all this that we've started to work through. I would say that the underlying themes remain the same with this idea of improving and lowering costs of the asset managers or the asset owners. Cost structure of improving their operations, trying to do an outsource of things that are not really critical to their investment, but critical to achieving better outcomes, both for their clients and for themselves. I think what's changed and what's been added to the consideration now is all of the operational stress that's been applied to these managers since then. Many, many managers were not prepared for work from home, and they certainly weren't prepared for a global work from home. So, we see that, if anything, providing another catalyst to these kinds of, what we consider, fundamental enterprise outsourcing. And you can see that it's playing through even in our new business. The line that we focus on is new business, plus business to be installed. And as you can see, the business to the installed number remains quite high. And that reflects the fact that the business, increasingly is less about just a single product and much more about multiple initiatives, multiple kinds of offerings that we have underway for our clients. And we think -- see this continuing. We see this -- the need and desire to outsource at the extreme. You'll have clients that just have antiquated systems or operations that need fundamental upgrading. At the other extreme and we've experienced this, too highly successful managers and asset owners that are saying, we can do this, but it's not a good use of our time, and we want to be able to scale and we want to work with a partner that could be there for us. So, we see this whole trend continuing and probably accelerating. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. Eric Aboaf : I'd just add that we're also -- obviously, these -- the revenues this year are based on the of bookings and the wins from last year by and large, I think about the installation process. And so far, I think we've been pleased with the continued implementation. Our onboarding team has been active through the end of March on-boarding some sizable clients on schedule. April, we've -- we're halfway through April and have visibility of the rest of the month and are not seeing any unusual or major delays. And so for the time being and I think if we could get through March and April, the -- that will bode well. But the previously one business tends to be installed on schedule because it needs to be, right? You've got the previous provider who needs to come off. You've got a lot of preparation that's been done. And so, so far, we've actually seen good progress or good continuity on the onboarding side, which is important because that's when the revenues tend to begin to be accrued. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. And the follow-up, just on the buyback side, you guys were part of the financial services form agreement to stop buybacks through the second quarter. But obviously, not being a credits -- as credit-sensitive of an institution. And just looking at the results this quarter, it would seem that you guys would have capacity to continue a buyback regardless of what the credit environment turned into. I'm just wondering just your thoughts on whether or not if the rest of the forum has to decide to continue to stop buybacks for longer than the second quarter, would you have to be a part of that? Or could you make -- start making your own decisions based on your own capacity to do so? Thanks. Ronald O'Hanley: Yes, Ken. We should be clear. We make our own decisions on this. We are part of the forum. We talked forum and we considered it actually a very good move to make to instill confidence in the system and to -- remember this happened at a time where people were questioning whether or not banks would be there. And we -- I felt it was not going to be useful for us to not be part of this and to have more time spent on, why are the one or two outliers as opposed to the banks are committed to being there during the crisis. But we make our own decisions. You're right. We are very different, and our results will play out differently than credit intensive banks. So, the good news is that with the new rules that are being implemented, capital planning can be much more dynamic than it has been in the past. And we'll take advantage of that as the situation plays out. I mean, the realities are that it's still highly uncertain. You heard that -- and the environment is highly uncertain. You heard that reflected in the assumptions upon which we based our guidance to you. One could argue that we've been very conservative, but one could argue also that the situation could get a lot worse than what our -- what we put out there as a point estimate. That's exactly what we've done. We've given a point estimate within a wide range of potential outcomes. The market level one is the biggest one. And there the assumption is, is that average markets will be what they were at period end March. I mean, that's -- we're already much -- the spot levels are higher than that. So, we really don't know here, which is why going back to your question on capital, if this all plays out as we see, we believe we'll be in a position to distribute capital, but we think it's wise to be able to make that decision dynamically quarter-to-quarter. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. If I can just ask a quick follow-up, Eric, just on one of your prepared remarks. The 10 to 40 of the potential fee waivers, that's not dissimilar to what happened prior cycle. Is that just like an aggregate number, like what could happen on a full year basis as opposed to a quarterly basis? Eric Aboaf : Ken its Eric. Yes, that's for the rest of the year, primarily in the second quarter. I gave you a large range, because it's also highly dependent on short rates, right? If the overnight repo rates are one or two basis points or six or seven or 10 or 11, you literally -- you could go from zero to the -- to what could be the upper end of that range. But that would have been for the rest of the year, and it would be primarily in the second half. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi good morning. Ronald O'Hanley: Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side. I know you indicated that you're looking at everything. And now we're anticipating that you're going to be able to bring expenses down 1% to 2% more than the prior commentary around down 1%. And I just wanted to understand where -- in an environment where you're not doing any redundancies, obviously, this year, could you speak to where there's some opportunity set to dig into that? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Betsy its Eric. The opportunity set is broad and it's a set of initiatives that we had underway. And in the spirit of -- when things are tougher, you've got to act more dramatically, is I think the theme that I share with you. So, if you think about the different areas of our expense base, the compensation benefits line won't be as much of a tailwind as we've, I think, made a very conscious and appropriate choice on protecting our people. But if you think about the expense base, that's only about half of the expense base. And even within the compensation benefits line, for example, there are contractors, there's significant amount of contractors that we employ. And if you think about it, if we're going to end up with a larger employee workforce than we expected, right? Contractors could be an area that we -- where we adjust. So, it's that kind of action. Occupancy is another natural one, whoever thought that you could run a company at a 80% or 90% work from home, but it does give us a real perspective as we have lease rollovers or where we might have been planning on taking additional leases, and there's always a role instead of either potential exits or ads that you're doing as you load balance. You can imagine, we've got lease ads on a complete moratorium. And where we had rollovers, you can imagine, we're now starting to move in the opposite direction and say, hey, why can't I let this space go? And when employees do come back, I want all my employees back, but we clearly have more flexibility than we ever would. So, that's another example. Third one might be around all the other expenses in technology, there's software, there's hardware purchases, et cetera. While our teams are spending time on supporting clients and literally hourly daily basis, it's also a natural time for us to slow some of our purposes of capital equipment or software, doesn't say we won't come back and naturally think about outspending some of that in the future, but it does mean that we can slow some of those purchases because it's -- we've shifted some of our time and energy to more immediate situation as opposed to some of the medium term investments. So, I think that's the other one, which is the -- kind of the reinvestment. We'll naturally slow to some extent. And if you remember the chart we did at the fourth quarter earnings call in January, we showed expenses down 1%. Now, we're saying down 1% to 2%. But within that, there was 3% or 4% increase in investments of expenses due to investments and 4% to 5% decrease going in the other direction. And so part of what we're doing is also, I think, being more disciplined about those reinvestments that we're doing now and pacing them. Betsy Graseck : Got it. No, it's interesting too on the occupancy side because while you might have people come back to work over time, you might not be as densely organized as you have been in the past. So, that's one of the reasons why I was kind of interested in can you actually reduce occupancy or not, but definitely makes sense on the lease rollovers and additional leases, at least for the near-term. Are you still -- go ahead. Ronald O'Hanley: What I would add to Eric's comments or a couple. We have had underway, as you would know, a lot of work on process redesign and automation, and that work is not stopping, right? How we -- how and when we realize the benefits of it may change and be delayed, but the work is not stopping. And so -- and if anything, we're redoubling our efforts there. So, I would just note that we've got this moratorium, and we absolutely think it's the right thing to do. But our work, both in IT and operations, and then how we connect with our clients that remains -- we're working full speed on that. The other point I'd make on the leases is that I agree with your point that we probably won't be as dense for a long period of time, at least until there's a vaccine. But I think it's surprised everybody, not just at State Street, but elsewhere, how effective one can be in work from home. And I would have to believe that over the medium and long-term, that you'll see us having less space than we do today. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Are you still going to be moving your headquarters? Ronald O'Hanley: We are. And that was always a natural financial benefit to us. So that's still underway for the end of 2022. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just focus on the average balance sheet in terms of the non-U.S. deposit rates of negative 20 basis points. If you could just go into that dynamically? What's driving that? I think that there may be FX swap expense against that. And then also just a commentary on the driver of the episodic -- or the net interest income that you described as episodic in the quarter? And then also, you mentioned 10 basis points on deposits in a prior comment. I missed what that deposit level was linked to? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Let me -- Brian, let me take those in order. So on the average balance sheet, you're right. The non-U.S. deposit costs fell, they were minus four basis points or minus 20 basis points. It's literally the effect of the FX swaps, which are diagrammed out in the footnote on that page. I think it's page seven of the financial addendum. And as well as some modest reductions in interest rates in foreign jurisdictions, right? Some of the European and Asian central banks drop rates, and so that will flow through that line as well. In terms of the NII that we reported in first quarter, we did note that there was about $20 million of higher-than-usual NII separate from the deposits. The deposits for welcome and additive NII. But away from deposits and loans and investments, the $20 million was really split into two. About half of that was literally the hedging effect that goes through. We hedge either debt or the rate coupons on some of the loans, and that creates a mark-to-market as you've got changes in the debt market. So it's worth about half of the $20 million. And the other half was actually some good positioning that we took in the quarter with the influx of deposits and in particular dollar deposits, we were dollar rich. Dollars were quite valuable. And so we -- the treasury team did quite well to invest those in either yen or euros. They're kind of one and two-day overnight basis swaps and that was renumerative to us. And at the same time, it was helpful to either clients or counterparties in those foreign jurisdictions who were $1 poor and needed some of the access to the dollars that we could provide. So those were the two components of the $20 million. Finally, on the deposits, what I did say to one of the earlier questions is the value of deposits has changed significantly in P&L terms. I mean, the value of deposits always high on a balance sheet basis and not that we needed more deposits. But we were happy to accept them from our clients. The point that I made is that the level of deposits in the first quarter and then last year were a big -- had a large impact to NII, because the kind of typical deposit. Let me kind of use that in very broad swap might have been worth 100 basis points, think about the cost we would have paid on average for the deposits, saying in the U.S., versus the IOER rate at the Fed. That would be kind of a simple approximation. If you fast forward in, say, in April or in second quarter, how valuable is that same mix of U.S. deposits? It's much less. It's closer to 10 basis points. And why is that? It's because our cost of funds -- the cost of those deposits to us could be zero or one basis points or two or three. But we reinvest them at IOER rates of 10 basis points. And so what we effectively had is a very large change in the value of incremental deposits between kind of the pre the Fed moves and then post Fed move. So, that was the point I was making. So the profit will matter a little bit to NII in the -- going forward, but not nearly as much as they would have mattered in the past. Brian Bedell : Right. That's very clear. Okay. And then just on the CRD commentary on the delay. Obviously, that makes sense given what's going on at work from home. Is -- can you comment on whether you think you're still on track for the 2021 revenue and expense synergies and the net benefit of $75 million to $85 million on EBIT on the revenue side net of investments and, I think, $55 million to $65 million on the cost side. Whether you think that sort of gets also pushed out with delay in implementations? And then the timing of the $1 trillion left to install in the servicing business, is that also delayed by COVID-19? Ronald O'Hanley: Brian, let me take those two different, but related questions. On Charles River, we're still quite confident in the revenue and expense synergies. The expense ones are something we do as a matter of course. And you can imagine, we'll actually try to accelerate those a bit, but those are on track. And then on the revenue side, a good bit of those synergies are actually coming from some of our trading businesses as we plug-in our FX and securities lending and other markets activities into Charles River, and that's on schedule and moving along at pace. So, we're currently confident in our delivering on the synergies for Charles River. On the servicing side, as I mentioned, the client on-boarding has stayed on track in March and April and so as we think about the time line of that $1.1 trillion to be installed for the servicing business, we think that will play out during the year. If you recall, I've talked about those wins and some of those wins are fast to install, say something like custody. And others, where it's a mix of custody and accounting and, perhaps, some of the offshore cross-border products, those tend to take longer. When you add middle office, it takes even longer. And -- but those are all part of the standard course of business. And we don't, at this point, see a slowdown in the implementation on onboarding rates. And so far, our clients are eager to move forward. Because in some ways, remember that business that we won came with some fee adjustments. Clients are -- want to conclude on those and so they need to implement the service. And so those are now because they're paired up, I think we'll stay on track on both sides. Brian Bedell : Great color. Thanks very much for all the detail. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Thanks. Good morning. Just two quick follow-ups. First, on CRD. Just in terms of the mid-single-digits versus double-digits, I just want to make sure from an understanding, like if we get to 2021 and, let's say, there are medical treatments and most people are back to work, would you expect like a pretty significant acceleration or from like a headcount or what like people can actually accomplish, would you just go back to sort of the low-double-digits? Like would you get that acceleration? Or is it just not possible just given like the timing of the implementation how much the people power that takes? Ronald O'Hanley: Yes, let me begin on that. I think that as Eric noted, we stand by the 2021 synergies that we laid out there. And I think what's happening here is that, the pipeline that Charles River would have seen versus the pipeline that it's seeing now is quite different. It tends to be larger, more complicated and sophisticated clients. It tends to be part of a multiproduct installation. So, what you're seeing is it's just taking longer to install and therefore for the part of the deal that gets credited to Charles River, it's just taking longer for that to happen. And in fact, you're seeing now in the current installations, two very large installations underway, one of which has been out there since before we acquired the firm and that's changed over time, and that's delayed the revenue recognition. So, over the long-term -- over the medium and long-term, do we believe that this business can grow faster under us than it was prior to us? Yes, we do. Michael Carrier : Okay. And then just on FX. The comments that you made makes sense. Given some of the investments that you guys have made in the platform, when you've seen the uptick in volatility, has there been any kind of increases in like clients that the number of products that could be sustainable if we continue to get some level of volatility? Obviously, we'll get a moderation, but maybe have you seen anything in terms of traction on that platform at the new level could be at a higher pace? Ronald O'Hanley: Yes. We -- market share is a hard thing to measure in this business because nobody uses just 1 provider. But we have invested heavily over the past couple of years in this era of low volatility to build market share to show and demonstrate the clients, the capabilities that we have, and that really helped when it came time. And the team came through and the transactions occurred really difficult roles, period end roles that were going to be hard to execute, got done, and clients remember that. So, we think this market share that we've built will last for us. As Eric noted, what we saw was just immense volatility, an immense kind of move from risk-on to risk-off assets, including moves out of certain base currencies to others and all crisis driven. So if we see that again, then there's lots of bad news elsewhere. Will we likely see -- or could we likely see is maybe a better way to describe it, volumes higher than what we've seen in the 2018-2019 timeframe? Possibly, right? Because I think we'll be in an era of -- I mean, almost any forecast, one would have to believe has some level of heightened risk. The other thing too is, I mean, we saw our giant rotation out, particularly of emerging markets. I mean, at some point, there'll be a rotation back, and that tends to be also beneficial to us too. So, again, we gave you an estimate and we tried to be conservative here, recognizing the range of -- or the amount of uncertainty and therefore the range of possible assumptions. But there certainly is a case where one could expect to see not sustained levels, at least in our forecast that we saw in Q1, but levels above what we've seen in the prior four to eight quarters. Michael Carrier : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good morning. Just one question -- maybe kind of an update on where we're at in April, if you look at the balance sheet, you had the overdraft that came in at the end of the quarter. You also had the $27 billion of investment securities from the MMLF that were on the balance sheet. And then maybe could you just give an update on where those stand? Those just roll back off now that things have kind of stabilized? And also the same with the money microphone flows? I mean, what are you seeing thus far in April? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. The end-of-period balance sheet is a good starting point for -- to follow-up on that question. And here's how I'd frame it. I think the MMLF balance is, we're at about $27 billion at the end of the reporting period on March 31. And they've been in that range, I mean, plus/minus a few billion dollars has we've been in that range for the first two weeks of April. And then deposits, which had spiked to just over $250 billion or probably closer to $200 billion to $210 billion. So it's really the deposit -- the reduction in deposits that are adjusting the balance sheet down by call it, $50 billion end of period relative to what we saw. There will be a few other smaller movements. Overdrafts have continued to float back down to more traditional levels, the mark on the forwards and the FX books have started to revert. So, there's a few billion here or there and a couple of other areas, but the biggest one is the guidance, I gave on deposits coming down by about $50 billion from the end-of-period levels, will be the biggest change so far that we see. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Michael Mayo : Hi. Ron, can you talk about the trade-off of basically offense versus defense, the tone that you're sending to the company? When I think of offense, I think of long-term market share, helping out the government being part of the solution, like you're doing with the money market. Maybe more help as the Fed expands its balance sheet, gaining share versus smaller competitors by doing a little bit extra. When I think of defense, I think of short-term hunker down, live to quite another day, like what you're doing more for employees, you're not buying back stock. And then maybe even for clients, if they're not making you as much money, still kind of living with that. So how do you think about that trade-off in this unusual world? Ronald O'Hanley: Well, it's -- Mike, it can't be one or the other. But I would say that, particularly since we feel like over the last year, year-and-a-half, we've gotten a very good handle on our expenses, not just from an expense level, but how we manage those expense levels, how we manage the productivity. I think you will find that our tone and our actions are mostly around offense. Certainly, as it relates to clients, we have had unparalleled levels of client communication and client engagement. And if anything, the time in working from a home cause people to redouble and re-triple their efforts to be there to support clients. And that will pay off for years to come. So, we think that, in the short-term, we have to be protecting our employees, both their -- physically and mentally. And we think we've taken the appropriate actions there, but we don't think we've taken them at the expense of any kind of long-term opportunity creation for ourselves and our shareholders. Michael Mayo : And as it relates to clients, you mentioned the rotation out of emerging markets, historically; an emerging markets equities fund would generate higher custody fees than a plain vanilla bond portfolio. So, if people move out of high-risk into lower-risk, wouldn't that hurt fees to assets under custody? And maybe you're doing a little bit extra for clients, even though you're not getting paid as much? Ronald O'Hanley: Yes. Well, my reference to emerging markets, I mean, that rotation was happening, and just if anything has played itself out even further over the last month. I don't believe that, that's makes sense over -- certainly, it doesn\u2019t make sense over the long-term. It won't make sense over the medium term. And we would expect to see as the situation -- as the situation stabilizes and investors start looking at relative valuations around the world, they'll see the -- just the value opportunities in emerging markets. So, I wasn't suggesting even a greater rotation, rotations largely happen. The question is when will the rotation back occur? Michael Mayo : I just -- then in terms of, if there's risk off, does that mean clients go to more plain vanilla portfolios where you get less fees? Ronald O'Hanley: Yes. Well, certainly, in the short-term, that's what they're doing, right? I mean, it's -- you're seeing a giant push into cash, but at the levels that investors are getting paid and the amount of stimulus, first, monetary and increasingly fiscal that's going to be put in. Again, one person's opinion. I think that the more likely long-term trend is for risk assets, particularly equities to continue to provide superior returns. And in a period of uncertainty like this, which is not only uncertain, but previously unknown, you're not going to see as much in the short-term until there is more certainty. But all of the ingredients are in place, low -- lots of monetary stimulus, lots of cash in the system, low interest rates, to see a return to risk on at the appropriate time. Michael Mayo : And then, one more follow-up, Eric, were on. Just, look, do you -- anything you can glean from what's happening in Asia or outside the U.S. that gives you extra insight to the U.S., especially like what percentage of your workforce is the office in Asia at this point versus the U.S.? Or any other trends or like, I said insight since you are in more than one country, obviously? Ronald O'Hanley: Yes. So -- and probably China, our Hangzhou operation is a great example of what we can expect worldwide. We started -- we were given the go-ahead to start returning employees there back in the middle of March. And we're now back up to about 75% -- between 75% and 80% back to work. And we've actually metered that. We -- as we've noted earlier, we have not densified the office as much. We've put -- we've got testing facilities on the way in. Initially, people were wearing mask. And now you're seeing a much more normal working environment. And I think that will stay for as long as there's not another outbreak. What we're seeing elsewhere, in Asia is, not quite as fast to return to work. But -- but you're also seeing guidelines kind of ebb and flow, as you see periodic outbreaks. And I think that's probably what we're going to live with around the world. I don't think this will be a straight-line recovery, in terms of whether it's back to work or back to gatherings. I think that there will be periodic outbreaks. Businesses and governments will need to respond to those. They're not going to respond in the same way, if the lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong or anything they'll be very targeted guidelines. For example, in Singapore, they just recently limited restaurants, again, but they didn't send everybody home from work. So, I think that's what you can expect to see, if you will, a steady recovery back over time. But with some lumpiness along the way as there are outbreaks, until we get to a -- until we get first to testing, and then to widespread availability of vaccines. Michael Mayo : That's great. And how many employees you have in China because that's a fascinating specific, 75% to 80% are back to work in China? Ronald O'Hanley: 3,000 in China, the vast majority of them, 2,800, in our Hangzhou facility. Michael Mayo : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi Eric. Good morning. So Eric, I wanted to ask a question on the securities portfolio. Just given your heavier mix towards fixed versus floating, I think in the 10-K, you sighted a longer duration of around 2.7 years for your book, relative to where some of your peers are managing it. I'm just wondering what causes the NII to stabilize by year-end, just given some of the reinvestment headwinds could persist. And maybe if you could frame what reinvestment yield or level you're assuming, versus the 200 basis points of the securities bookings earnings today? Eric Aboaf : Steven, its Eric. There are a number of factors that you've got to assemble to really predict the path of NII. And in our 10-K, we tend to assemble them all together. And the securities portfolio is just one of them. If you think about the average duration of our balance sheet, you are right. The securities portfolio has an average duration of 2.6, 2.7 years. But the rest of the asset side of the balance sheet is actually much more floating rate. And remember, the securities portfolio is ex the MMLF to keep it simple is call it, just shy of $100 billion out of a $250 billion typical balance sheet. So it's an important piece, but it's not the only piece. The effect of that is that the average duration of the asset side of the balance sheet that we have is about 1.3 years, so about half of the duration of the securities portfolio. And it's that -- and that shorter net asset or the lower duration of the total asset side of the balance sheet is what creates a re-pricing that tends to be a little faster than you would have expected by just thinking about the investment portfolio. So, as we've played that through our models and, obviously, in our models, there are a lot of different factors, but those two are important ones. You see a step down from first quarter to second quarter that's significant. I gave an indication of that. We see another step down, but not as large in percentage terms from second quarter to third quarter. And then starting in the fourth quarter, you see a fair amount of stability between fourth quarter and then our guesstimates of what we might see in the first and second quarter of 2021. And part of that is that you've got the interest rate effects playing out. Then you've got some natural balance sheet growth, which creates a bit of a tailwind. And so once we get through the bulk of the interest rate effect, which happens in the first couple of quarters, the headwinds and the tailwinds tend to roughly even out, which is why we think we'll see some stability from the fourth quarter onwards. Steven Chubak : Okay. Thanks for that, Eric, really helpful color. The one piece you, I was hoping you could clarify is what reinvestment yield or level are you assuming on the securities book? Eric Aboaf : Yes, the -- I'm trying to think about a good way to describe that to you. So, our investment portfolio yield right now is about just over 2%. And that will -- that's been -- that floated down just marginally, but that's because rates fell quickly towards the very end of the quarter. If I think about reinvestment levels in the portfolio, I guess we could talk about new investments, what's rolling off. There's a lot of ins and outs of that. Maybe the better way to describe it is that the average yield on the portfolio is about 2% on average for first quarter. If we start to think about what's the average yield in second quarter and maybe in the third and fourth quarter, we're closer to about 1.5% kind of roughly if I eyeball what the averages will look like. And that will be driven by the new roles being added and the old roles coming off. But that's probably a good rough amount, a good rough estimate for you. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that, Eric. And just one more follow-up, if I may. Lots of helpful detail in the loan mix and composition. There were provisions that you reported was a mealy a bit lighter than peers. If we compare your reserve levels versus DFAST losses, on that screen or on that basis, you look a bit under reserve. But if you look at your company run stress tests, it looks like you're being in line with the rest of the peer group. And so just given that a lot of investors are using the Fed stress test in the DFAST as a framework for forecasting provisions, I was hoping you could clarify or speak to some of the differences in what the Fed assumes versus what you guys are assume for your company run? And why you're comfortable modeling lower losses relative to the Fed? Eric Aboaf : Steve its Eric. So, a couple of perspectives there some of which you touched on and others, which I'll add. I think first, we added to a reserve about $35 million. So, the reserve was up about one-third. And I think when I scanned across peers, you saw reserve increases of anywhere between 30% and 50% on corporate books. So, I think we're -- we made the right upward adjustment just given what we do at the time and what our forecasts were as of March 31. In terms of comparing the reserves to say, the CCAR losses, either the Fed model or our own models or to loans, I think that's where the mix of the loan book is in -- at all those ratios is incredibly sensitive to the mix of the loan book. If you think about it, our fund finance loans and one could go back to the last crisis, the 2008 crisis, performed particularly well. And so we've got to factor that into our reserving. And what I would say is that the reason the fed both does its math on estimated losses under CCAR and then asks us to do our math, is not just to say, hey, there will be a natural bid ask, but it is to reflect the different nature of the books. If you think about it, I think the Fed spent an enormous amount of time as you would expect on what is the typical mid-market corporate lending book going to result in, in terms of losses? Or what's the typical credit card book that it's -- and how will it perform under stress? I would think that, while they have extensive modelers, they probably spent a little less time on our fund finance to capital call line book just because it's small and it's not widespread around the industry. So, I would at least say that in our particular circumstances, the company run stress tests that you've been referencing are in our mind is a good indicator of credit under stress and May. But I'll be sensitive to it because all models are informative, maybe a bit more indicative than some of the Fed models just because they tend to be much more averaged across more kind of a non-custodial set of banks. Steven Chubak : Thanks so much for your helpful color. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Robert Wildhack : Good morning guys. In the slide deck, you called out some pricing headwinds contributing to both sequential and year-over-year declines in the servicing fee line. Can you just expand on what you're seeing there? And then more broadly, what are your thoughts on pricing from here given the shift in the macro? Thank you. Ronald O'Hanley: Why don't I begin--? Eric Aboaf : Hey, Bob, it's- Ronald O'Hanley: Why don't I start, Eric? In terms of -- I'll start with your second question -- on the second part of your question, Eric will answer the first. We have spent a lot of time with our clients. Remember, we've got a fairly concentrated book of business. Our 100 largest clients constitute a big portion of the total. And we're through 80-plus percent of that, we've gotten term out of a lot of them. But more importantly, we've just learned how to do this better than we have in the past. So, while, for sure, our clients will be under their own sets of stress as a result of this, we are not anticipating a heightened level of price compression. Part of it is that it's a given -- if you think about the way that we're remunerated in a client relationship, a part of that is NII and they can see as well as we can that that is -- that the source of return is going away. So, we think it's reasonable to assume that the pricing, as we've said before, will -- pricing pressure is abating, that it will continue to abate and level out at a normal level, which is -- it's not going to go away, but it will be a normal level as opposed to what it's been over the past couple of years and nothing that we've seen this year so just anything different on that. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Rob, it's Eric. I'd just add that pricing has been a natural part of this custody business for decades. And what we're doing in the disclosure on the slide deck is literally given you for servicing fees, what's the very transparent roll forward and net new business flows and client activity, which were up this quarter actually was a tailwind, market appreciation and depreciation and then pricing going the other way. So, it's just part of our natural disclosure now and on a going-forward basis. But as Ron said, we expected a certain amount of pricing to come through during this year at that kind of 3% level, so down from the 4% headwinds we saw last year. And we're -- everything we're seeing suggests that we're on track for that currently and it will be -- it will moderate from last year's levels, so in line with what we currently expect. Robert Wildhack : Got it. Thank you guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Ron. Good morning, Eric. Ronald O'Hanley: Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Eric, thank you for the detail on the loan portfolio, very helpful. As another question, on that leveraged loan portion of the portfolio, are you primarily a participant in those loans, the syndicated type loans? Or are you the lead? And then second, are they all subject to the shared national credit exam process? Eric Aboaf : Gerard its Eric. I think the answer is an easy yes to both of those. So we tend to be a participant in a set of syndicates with the other large banks and work closely with them. We'll occasionally, but we tend to be a participant at the table. And we tend to operate within syndicates of sister banks that we feel when they lead are very thoughtful about credit and credit appetite because it's not just a particular loan, but it's the covenants, it's the terms and conditions that matter. And so the choice we make of which syndicates to join, and which lead banks to partner up with is important. So -- but that tends to be our position to participate. And then absolutely, we participate in the SNC reviews and SNC tests. And so that's a way for us to, I think, for the industry and for our supervisors to make sure that we evaluate credit consistently. I think what's helpful about leverage loans is they're also traded in the marketplace. So, there's an external market benchmark, and that's -- they are external ratings. And oftentimes there are prices, but there's also the SNC review process. We participate in that. And so we feel like we've got a very good read into the quality and health and -- of our book. And as I mentioned, it tends to be double the average book with actually some BBBs and higher and just very few under the BB level. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just a quick follow-up. You gave us good information on the positive flow and what you saw at the end of the quarter and what's happened since then. Can you share with us what were the customers, or who are the customers that were the primary drivers of that deposit inflow? And then are they the same customers that are withdrawing now or is it a different group that are actually withdrawing the deposits? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Gerard, let me give you a little bit of texture because if you think about our client base, it's asset managers, asset owners, alternative providers, insurance, a wide breadth. I think what we -- what we saw is that while they all tended to become more liquid and go to cash, and so we had some increase in deposits from across all those segments, the single largest area came from our asset managers. And sometimes, it was the asset managers who were running money funds and they were derisking those funds and then leaving the deposits with us. And sometimes it was just the asset managers running various funds that we custody for equity funds, bond funds, U.S., international, et cetera, where they were derisking within those funds and shifting to cash. And so those are probably the two different factors within asset management -- asset manager complexes. And it's that cash that's come back and sits on our balance sheet. And so I think part of what we're watching for is how quickly does that cash get reinvested versus how liquid do those managers want to stay, whether it's the kind of money market complexes they run? And so sometimes they stay in cash as opposed to even buying short and medium-term treasuries. Or how risk off some of the long players or even the alternative providers want to be. But those are the factors, and it was primarily around asset managers. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're delighted to make our balance sheet available to them, both on the -- as they have these flight to quality deposits or even operationally as we support them with overdrafts, because that's -- both of those are important parts of our business. In addition, even to some of the off-balance sheet activity, the sponsored repo and other facilitation that we provided, let's get another source of liquidity as well. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : That concludes the questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks. Ronald O'Hanley: Thank you, operator, and thanks to all on the call. Thanks for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene and good morning everyone. We released second quarter results this morning. Let me begin by saying that I am very pleased with our continued strong financial performance. I am proud of our team members worldwide, who continue to put our clients first and deliver these results for our shareholders. Turning to Slide 3, I will provide a brief update on how we are successfully navigating the COVID-19 operating environment, while also delivering earnings growth for our shareholders. Providing exceptional service quality through improved client engagement, driving product performance, supporting the overall financial system, and safeguarding our workforce are all key priorities for us. We demonstrated success in each of these areas this quarter and delivered strong results for our shareholders as a result. Our clients are at the center of everything we do. You will recall that in 2019 we took a number of actions to improve client service quality, engagement, and decision-making. These measures have led to improved client engagement, which is critically important in the current environment, and its impact is evident in our results and business performance. Our clients are continuing to turn to State Street for our operational capabilities and solutions. During the second quarter, we effectively managed to onboard a number of new client projects across various client segments, including a large asset manager, a significant asset owner, and a national wealth manager in CRD. Indeed, we see true sustainable momentum developing in our Alpha CRD platform. All this occurred while processing 13% and 35% increases in back and middle office transactions, respectively. We were the first service provider to support the launch of the semi-transparent ETF product, and we see strong demand in the market for this innovative solution. Our service quality is being recognized across the industry. For example, we are particularly proud of our ranking in the 2020 Euromoney FX Survey, where State Street was named the number one FX provider to asset managers for the third consecutive year, with a number one ranking in overall customer satisfaction globally. This strong client engagement is reflected in our product performance. Our investment servicing assets under custody administration, which increased 5% quarter-over-quarter to $33.5 trillion, had another healthy level of new wins amounting to $162 billion in the second quarter. Assets yet to be installed stood at a strong $1 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.1 trillion and we recorded $23 billion of total net inflows during the second quarter. Our SPDR range of ETFs recorded its best quarter of inflows since the fourth quarter of 2017, while SPDR GLD, the gold ETF at its strongest ever level of inflows at $12 billion. Further, we are competing and winning in key strategic areas of focus for us. Our recently expanded and re-benchmarked range of low-cost ETFs also recorded its highest quarterly level of inflows at $11 billion. Our sector SPDRs made strong market share gains with almost half of sector industry flows going into the product during the second quarter. And we remain flight to quality for cash management and liquidity solutions across a suite of product options. We continue to play a critical role in supporting the financial system. The operating environment remains uncertain as the pandemic continues to impact many parts of the world. While we have seen a partial recovery in some areas, many economic indicators continue to point negatively and unemployment remains high, reflecting the real human cost of this health crisis. State Street continues to support the broader economy and markets and is actively assisting client access to various Federal Reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit. Currently, State Street is involved in 5 Federal Reserve programs either directly, such as with the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or as the program\u2019s custodian and administrator, such as the Main Street Lending Facility. Lastly, developing a high-performing organization and planning ahead for our global workforce also continues to be a priority. We continue to have about 90% of our employees working from home as we optimize a work-from-home model while leveraging technology to enable better collaboration and more effective ways to serve our clients. Last quarter, we took \u2013 we took measures to protect our employees and announced that through the end of the year we suspended any workforce reductions other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID-19 crisis. Now, we are going further for our employees by increasing their opportunities for mobility by launching an internal talent marketplace. By supporting our employees, as they take on new roles and learn new skills, the marketplace will better develop and redeploy our internal talent to meet our evolving business needs and the growing demands of clients and stakeholders.  Turning to Slide 4 in our second quarter and first half performance highlights, I am pleased by our continued strong performance and the progress we are making toward achieving our medium-term financial goals. Relative to the prior-year period, total revenue increased 2% and fee revenue increased 5%. Second quarter EPS was $1.86, up 31% year-over-year and ROE was 12.1%. I am pleased to report that our second quarter pre-tax margin improved by over 2 percentage points year-over-year to 27%. Our first half pre-tax margin increased by 3 percentage points. The front-to-back Alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients. Our second quarter performance was helped by the strong revenue performance at Charles River development, where we had key business wins and renewals. The Alpha CRD pipeline continues to develop well with a good mix of deal sizes, functionalities, and scope. We expect to be announcing new major wins between now and year end. Turning to expenses, the pandemic created an immediate challenge to our expense reduction planning relative to our original expectations at the start of the year. To help offset this impact, we took immediate action by implementing a hiring freeze, launching the talent marketplace I just referenced and reassessing all discretionary expenses. I am pleased to report that through our continued expense management efforts, further IT optimization, and operational productivity measures, we reduced total expenses by 3% in the second quarter relative to the year ago period. While we continue to invest in our business, first half 2020 expenses are now down 2% net of those investments relative to the year ago period. For us, productivity management is a way of life as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during 2019 when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduce expenses through a comprehensive firm-wide expense savings program. We cannot control the economic environment, but we can control our expenses. Despite the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic has created, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model and enhance service quality even during this challenging period. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we are pleased with our 2020 CCAR results and the inaugural determination of our preliminary stress capital buffer at the minimum 2.5% level. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an unprecedented real time stress test and our strong capital position has enabled us to operate effectively, help stabilize the financial markets and support our clients, employees and communities. While the environment remains uncertain, State Street\u2019s performance under the Federal Reserve\u2019s severely adverse scenario is another reminder of our business model\u2019s resiliency and our capital stability. We recently announced our intention to continue our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.52 per share in the third quarter. Consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s instructions to all large banks, we will be suspending share repurchases for the third quarter. As we look ahead, given our strong capital position, we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters. We will of course take into account economic conditions, safety and soundness, the Federal Reserve supplemental CCAR scenarios and review process, our capital levels and any interim regulatory limitations. To conclude, I am very pleased with this quarter\u2019s results, which demonstrates continuing revenue improvement even during difficult times as well as further evidence of our ongoing ability to tightly control expenses while continuing to safeguard our employees and serve our clients. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Let me begin my review of second quarter by summarizing our year-over-year results on the left panel on Slide 5. EPS is up 31%. Revenue is up 2%. Expense is down 3% with expanding margins and healthy ROEs. And I think it is useful to point out that while we continue to operate in an extraordinary environment for the COVID pandemic, our results this quarter shows strong underlying momentum and durability in our State Street operating model. Our bellwether servicing fees are up year-on-year. Our prior investments in our global FX and CRD franchises have yielded strong results. We have been able to carry reserve builds. And throughout all of this, we have continued to drive expenses lower and lower. And so our pre-tax margin is up 2.3 points year-on-year and our ROE is up 2 points. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A levels increased 2% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year move was driven by higher period end market levels and client flows partially offset by previously announced client transition that had a de minimis effect on revenue during the quarter. Quarter-on-quarter, the AUC/A increased, which is partially reported on a lag was mainly due to higher period end equity market levels. AUM levels increased 5% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter to $3.1 trillion driven largely by higher period end market levels and net inflows. Amidst continued in uncertain economic conditions, Global Advisors saw net inflows of $23 billion driven by cash and ETF flows partially offset by institutional outflows. I highlight that our U.S. SPDR ETFs saw another strong quarter with $24 billion of inflows, which was well-diversified once again. As Ron mentioned, our low cost SPDR portfolio ETF saw their largest quarterly inflow yet and continue to gain share. Our commodity ETFs and sector ETFs saw strong inflows too. Moving to Slide 7, servicing fees were up 2% year-on-year reflecting higher client activity and net new business only partially offset by some pricing headwinds, which continue to moderate. Servicing fees were down 1% quarter-on-quarter driven by lower average market levels partially offset by higher client activity. Despite the recovery in equity markets since the first quarter, average domestic and international equity markets were still down sequentially impacting servicing fees. However, client activity remained elevated, so down from March levels as market volatility persisted throughout the quarter. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we have maintained business continuity and continue to provide clients with the benefits of our scale and diverse capabilities. On the bottom right of the panel, we have included again some sales performance indicators that underline this dynamic. As you can see, AUC/A wins totaled $162 billion in 2Q with several deals coming through. Assets to be installed as of period end 2Q are strong at $1 trillion. We continue to have a strong pipeline of front-to-back Alpha deals and expect multiple Alpha announcements in the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue lines. Beginning with management fees, 2Q revenues decreased 4% year-over-year driven by institutional product outflows and mix partially offset by strong net inflows from both ETF and cash products. With the second quarter now complete and a better sense of the forward rate picture, we now anticipate that the likely impact of money-market fee waivers, net of distribution expense will be at the low end of our previously announced range or just $10 million to $15 million for the full year. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, FX trading services saw another strong quarter, with revenues up 26% year-on-year, but down 25% quarter-on-quarter as the business again saw elevated volumes and increased client demand, but down from the record levels seen in 1Q. The FX trading franchises continued to see market share gains and increased client engagement. As Ron mentioned, we saw strong results across the recently released 2020 Euromoney Survey, securing the number one spot in global customer satisfaction service as well as the number one spot for all products and for electronic trading for our asset manager clients. Security finance revenue decreased 27% year-on-year as they do see lending demand for assets lightens and shift towards lower spread fixed income assets and as ongoing hedge fund de-leveraging in falling markets drove down enhanced custody demand. Securities finance revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, software and processing fees increased 46% year-on-year and more than doubled quarter-on-quarter driven by significant revenue-adds of CRD, which I will talk more about shortly and positive outcomes in our market sensitive activity, which includes certain currency translation impacts and marks on employee long-term incentive plans. These other items were positive this quarter in contrast to first quarter when they were notably negative. Moving to Slide 9, CRD generated standalone revenue of $145 million, which was up 59% year-on-year and 45% quarter-on-quarter driven by a large wealth implementation and several large asset manager renewals. We have always talked about the lumpiness inherent in ASC 606 revenue recognition standards. So, while we are extremely pleased with these results, we remind you not to read across any one quarter. Moving to the right hand side of the page, we were quite pleased to see the momentum in CRD this quarter overall and the progress we have made to extend the CRD presence in the wealth segment in particular, which you may recall was one of our key synergy commitments at the time of acquisition. Wealth now represents approximately 20% of CRD revenue and represents another area of growth for us. Turning to Slide 10, NII decreased 9% year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the impact of episodic market benefits of $20 million in the first quarter, NII was down 13% quarter-on-quarter. The sequential decline in NII was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of lower market rate, including the impact of central bank intervention with more USD liquidity driving lower than expected sponsor repo volumes. We continue to support client\u2019s use of the Federal Reserve\u2019s money market mutual fund liquidity facility. As a result this quarter, MMLF balances averaged $19 billion and finished the quarter at $11 billion. You will see on the left hand side of the slide, this quarter we all are also showing our NIM excluding the impact of the MMLF. While MMLF had a positive impact on NII this quarter, its impact on our NIM was a negative 5 basis points. Average assets increased 13% quarter-on-quarter, an average deposits increased 9% quarter-on-quarter. However, period-end deposits decreased 22% or $57 billion quarter-on-quarter as a portion of the uptick in the deposits we saw at the height of the pandemic receded in the last few months. Given the Fed\u2019s expansion of the money supply, however, we do expect a good portion of the current deposits to stay with us, which we will reinvest in a mix of both loans and securities. Moving to Slide 11, we have again included some color on the loan portfolio as well as the company\u2019s allowance for credit losses. On the top panels of this page, you can see updated detail around our high-quality loan book and its characteristics compared to first quarter average loans decreased 4%, while period-end loans decreased 17% primarily driven by reduction in client overdraft levels we saw during March. Overall, the loan book remains healthy with our largest lending category, capital call financing to private equity funds see no change in borrowing pattern, but with continued strong demand for new facilities. Moving to the bottom panels, the allowance for credit losses increased to $163 million, primarily due to a $52 million in provisions for credit losses driven by changing economic conditions and ratings migration offset by $14 million in net charge-offs. You will note we took advantage of a rally in the leverage loan market to selectively de-risk our leverage loan portfolio and exited certain positions, which effectively cost us $6 million given the necessary reserve bill, so a good trade. On Slide 12, we have again provided a view of expenses this quarter ex-notables so that the underlying trends are readily visible. Our 2Q \u201820 expenses were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% quarter-on-quarter, excluding both notable items and seasonal expenses, with favorable trends across most expense categories. As we said last quarter, amidst the ongoing pandemic, we continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year. And while we suspended workforce reductions for year end other than for performance or conduct reasons in light of the COVID crisis, we have found additional expense opportunities to act upon. We continue to make progress on lowering compensation benefits costs, occupancy costs and other costs, while IT costs are lumpy, but on track. We are particularly pleased that our results reflected continued and sustainable expense reduction, notwithstanding the extraordinary market conditions, while also delivering top line revenue growth. Moving to Slide 13, on the right, you can see the evolution of CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. We are thus navigating this challenging environment with strong capital levels. In 2Q, our standardized CET1 ratio increased 1.6 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.3% driven by solid retained earnings and a reduction in RWAs as market volatility receded. The Tier 1 leverage ratio was essentially flat at 6.1% due to higher capital levels offset by higher deposits. We were also pleased with our 2020 CCAR results. Our capital resilience under the Fed stress scenarios continues to demonstrate our low risk profile. And this year, we received a preliminary stress capital buffer requirement of 2.5%, which would have been much lower if it were not floored at 2.5%. As you know, the Fed has had large banks to suspend share buybacks in third quarter. However, we expect to continue to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share. And finally, as Ron noted, the firm\u2019s capital position remains strong amidst the uncertainty created in the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters, but we will do so considering economic conditions, safety and soundness, the Fed\u2019s supplemental CCAR scenarios and review process, our capital levels and then the interim regulatory limitations. Turning to Slide 14, we have again provided a summary of our 2Q results. As we mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results and believe they are a reflection of the durability and resiliency of State Street\u2019s business model as well as our focus on delivering on our strategy of both growth and productivity. Throughout this crisis, we have differentiated ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients through these difficult times. We believe that our resiliency during this extraordinary period and our constant attention to service quality has created goodwill with our clients and positioned us for share gains over the medium to long-term. Last quarter, I outlined our full year financial outlook under a certain set of assumptions, noting that there was a range of possibilities as a result of the potential length of the COVID pandemic and the associated economic impacts. I would like to update those expectations with our current thinking, again, noting there remain a broad range of possible outcomes. We now expect global central banks will keep short rates at current levels for the remainder of the year and long end rates will stay at a June 30 spot rates through year end. We also now assume that average global equity markets levels for the remainder of 2020 will be flat to current levels. As a result of our client engagements, moderating pricing pressure and CRD and Alpha front-to-back wins, we now expect that full year fee revenue will no longer be down 1% to 2% year-on-year for the full year 2020, but instead will be up approximately 1.5% to 2% with servicing fees expect to show a year-over-year improvement relative to 2019. Regarding NII given the impact of continued lower long end rates on the investment portfolio and central bank intervention with more USD liquidity driving down the expected repo volumes, we now expect NII to be down approximately 9% to 11% on a sequential quarter basis and expect the fourth quarter to be relatively in line with the coming third quarter. Turning to expenses, we remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and achieving automation benefits. We expect that full year expenses will now be down at the better end of our previous guide of down 1% to 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items as we continue to find ways to control and drive down expenses. In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic conditions and any ratings migrations. On taxes, we expect our tax rate for the full year to be closer to the lower end of our 17% to 19% range. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, can you open the call to questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, if you could just unpack a little bit the NII guide just in terms of what you are seeing for client deposit levels moving into 3Q, and to what extent your guidance for 3Q and 4Q includes more reinvestment or more shift of deposits into longer term securities? I am sorry, also one more on that is the repo financing business in terms of the impact, it looks like that was much lighter in the second quarter, so just your thoughts on that for the second half as well? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Eric, you are muted. Eric Aboaf : Brian it\u2019s Eric. Thanks for the question. We are clearly navigating through some challenging times with the interest rate environment and obviously trying to do our best to navigate through. When you think about the NII guide, there is clearly the continued downtick in long-term rates, which is affecting the investment portfolio, and we will continue to some extent in the coming quarters after that. And then there is lower volume sequentially and overdraft and then the MMLF balances that are also contributing to that \u2013 to the second quarter to third quarter decline. I think once we get to that level, part of what happens is that you have got offsetting factors, you have got on one hand the lower long end rates which put up -- which tend to tractor through the investment portfolio for another couple of quarters, which creates a downdraft. And those I think can be offset by the growth in the investment portfolio and lending base, which is really supported by the higher levels of deposits that we are operating at. Now, it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what the deposit levels are going to be, but I think if you stare at the data that we have shown here, you know, we used to run at $155 billion to $160 billion of deposits. First quarter average was solidly at $180 billion. Second quarter averages solidly at $197 billion. We think we are going to land somewhere between those two points, which means that off of the original base as, call it $160 billion of deposits, there is an ability to expand the investment portfolio put on duration carefully and selectively invest in some high-quality position to maintain our HQLA, and we think that together should create some stability on NII in the coming quarters. The sponsored repo program, as you mentioned, did create a downdraft from 1Q to 2Q. And what we are seeing there is that the overnight repo rates are less attractive then they have been relative to 1-month treasury rates, and so that creates reduction in volumes. If that were to persist, then we are not going to get a lift there and we are not going to get the volumes we would like to see. On the other hand, if that normalizes back, there could be some upside in the coming quarters, but more time will tell before we can incorporate that into our forecast. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. That\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe on CRD, you had a very strong quarter, very encouraging on the wealth management wins, maybe just a two-part question, Eric, on the revenue trajectory, obviously, it\u2019s lumpy like you said, maybe if you can just try to characterize what you thought was one-time licensing fee revenue within the second quarter? And then maybe Ron, if you want to talk a little bit about that wealth strategy, it sounds very encouraging in terms of the win that you have announced and potential new wins down the road? And maybe just in terms of sizing that space for you, what you are doing there on the wealth side that\u2019s different than the institutional asset manager side at CRD? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Brian, why don\u2019t I start and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric. So I will start on the latter part of your question there. As we mentioned, when we acquired Charles River in addition to its core institutional client segment, it developed a fair amount of technology applicable to the wealth segment, particularly the larger wealth manager segment, large private wealth managers, warehouses, etcetera. And that is -- we have continued that R&D and also leveraged our own client relationships to be able to help propel that growth, and that\u2019s what you are seeing playing through. We see it as a solid and additional form of growth on top of the core institutional business. Right now, I think it\u2019s about 20% of the business, up significantly from when we acquired it and we would expect it to be growing probably a little bit more than the \u2013 at a slightly higher level than the institutional business. And the good news about this is that it shares the same technology and operating platform. I mean, there are certain sub applications that are different, but we can do this at scale easily. And the way I would say you should think about the lumpiness, I mean, Eric, will take you through the how the accounting actually works, but when you start to see kind of positive lumpiness like this, I mean, it\u2019s essentially a client being installed, and it\u2019s at the point then that we can start to recognize revenue and following that will be ongoing recurring fee. So, that\u2019s how you should interpret the lumpiness. It\u2019s not necessary. It is one-time as it relates to that client, but it\u2019s certainly not one time as we continue to grow. You will see that same kind of lumpiness. Eric Aboaf : Brian, let me add some texture and even some numbers to that so that you can get a better sense of the underlying revenues here. And we are quite pleased with the growth trajectory. We are quite pleased with the pipeline with kind of contracted, but not yet installed levels. We track a number of different metrics here to give us confidence in the developing growth. The revenues really come, I will call it, broadly into two buckets. There is SaaS revenues and professional services. And SaaS revenues are pretty straightforward, you win a client, it\u2019s a 5-year contract and the revenue recognition is that the revenue is ratably applied over those five years, very straight forward. And in fact, we want to be in the business of growing SaaS revenues over time and professional services because those create a very regular and recurring set of revenues. The second part of the revenues comes from on-premise installations, and we have a number of clients who\u2019ve had on-premise installations and even some who continue to prefer them. And in those cases, the revenue recognition comes in two parts. You have an upfront piece, which could be in the range of around 60% of the contract. And then you have the balance, call it 40% in the example I have given you, which could be ratably over the contract length, if that were say a four- or five-year contract, and so you get a piece and then you get a trail behind that. So those are the two big pieces.  When we look at the revenue numbers that we showed you on page nine, you go back what we want to be doing, we want to be growing both pieces to be honest and in particular, the regular. The first one, the very recurring revenue base, if you go back on Page 9 and you look at the data that we showed around revenues, back in the second quarter of 2019, we had $91 million of revenues, about 65% of that was in SaaS and professional fees. And so it gives you a sense for the kind of the relative amount if you go quarter over quarter of this year, those recurring SaaS and professional fee revenues were just over $80 million. But we see both, we see nice growth, year on year, and in fact, it\u2019s happened consistently over the five quarters, and then the balance of the 145 is been more in the on-premise kind of revenue installations where you get a good sized piece up front, but then the recurring piece in the future. And I think if you step back with that kind of revenue recognition, where we are focused on growing client and client engagements and some clients are delighted to be on the Saas platform and we have seen consistent growth there. So that gives us some confidence in the kind of the, the, the completely recurring base, and then you have the more on-prem kind of revenues which start off with a piece, they then have a trail. Alright, and then when the contract ends, you get another piece in the that\u2019s lumpy, and then in a trail after that, and that\u2019s just the nature of the beast of how, how the revenue recognition works all in. we are quite pleased with this revenue trajectory the backlog the contracted but not yet installed and the sales performance and so while you see some lumpiness, it is we are seeing good underlying metrics as well. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color and a lot of detail. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to understand a little bit on the expense side. I know you called out, improvement there in part from things like market data, which is, really impressive given that market data cost for most, participants is moving higher and higher every quarter. So just want to get a little bit of color on that and on the sub-custody savings and to what degree is there, more legs there and that, specific line item in your expenses? Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. Both of those are sizable expense categories, they both are part of the transaction processing line item that we report. And, what we found is that we need to just actively manage those, sub-custody is something that that we need provided to us. And so, we\u2019ve worked with some of the largest banks, as well as some of the, country banks to find the best mix of service at a declining cost level, in our view that is something we need to keep doing year after year. And we have been able to deliver I think, some good savings this year and our expectation is to continue that trajectory. Market data is a little more complicated to your point is that there is a of market data ingestion that is possible. And what we found is that we need to both manage the ingestion pipes, because if we secure market data in too many different pipes, then we end up buying more than we need. We also need to find vendors. And over the last couple of quarters, we have started to really work more closely with several of our vendors around who gives us the best cost and pricing kind of quality levels. And that\u2019s also been factored in. And then there is a third piece to be honest on market data, which I find helpful from a client standpoint to be honest, which is some of our market data costs are borne by us, which we want to drive down, but with the right quality and others, market data costs are sometimes borne with our buyer clients. And we are in many cases working with our vendors against both pools of market data to try to secure the best results for them as well. So, lots of activity there. What I would tell you is that some of what you see on that transaction processing line is the result of some intense focus on those areas. And it\u2019s actually a bit of an example of what we are doing in other areas. We talked about starting to drive our technology costs down. And so we are doing similar work on hardware costs and hardware vendors working with them in a more active way. We are doing that in software and maintenance contracts from the technology side. And so it\u2019s really become an expanding, I will call it expertise, but sort of partnerships and approaches that we have taken I think to good effect, but to be honest one that we need to repeat year after year to get the benefits that we would like to help drive our expanding margins. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so you have got some more legs there is the nut of that answer. And I appreciate all the color. It\u2019s interesting especially with the client side of it. The follow-up I have for you, Eric, is regarding the net interest income, net interest margin outlook and I know you have a 9% to 11% down 2Q and 3Q and then stabilization into 4, maybe you could give us some color on the assumptions around the four key stabilizations, what has to happen for that to come through? Eric Aboaf : Yes. The 4Q stabilization is really driven by I think the economic kind of the interest rate environment first and foremost. So we are assuming short-end rates stays more or less where they are and we are assuming long-end rates stay more or less where they are. You know, the forwards always have some expansion and increase and I think we have gotten a little gun shy about always planning for those. And so we feel like we should plan at the current levels. So that\u2019s the first part of the assumption base. I think the second part of the assumption base is that there is some normalization deposits, but as I have said, I think we have got a nice chunk there that we can begin to think of this, whether we are confident, are stickier. And it depends on the speed of our reinvestment in the investment portfolio into some asset classes that we are comfortable with. And I think that will factor in as well. Betsy Graseck : Okay, alright. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Quick follow-up question on the expense side, I heard your overall comments. So that\u2019s what matters most. But within this quarter\u2019s 3.3% dropdown, 40% of the reduction expenses was lower marketing and travel, I am assuming that\u2019s the product of the environment. So how much of that is sustainable or works its way back and again, I appreciate that\u2019s probably part of your overall expense comment? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Glenn, that\u2019s fair, because as you just \u2013 as you know, we are trying to find sustainable expense reductions this year and then into next year. And if we just brought them down and they pop back up, that doesn\u2019t count neither for our shareholders nor for us. There aren\u2019t some tailwinds of travel expenses and even some medical benefit claims, you know, are lighter in the expense trends, but remember, there is also some headwinds that we would have are actions in areas where we would have driven expenses down that we weren\u2019t able to. And so as the biggest simple example is the pause on layoffs because of the pandemic, that would have been worth at least half a point of expense reduction, if not a little more, for every quarter this year and on a full year basis. And I think what we are going to have to do next year is go back to what we have been doing driving down all of our costs or compensation benefit costs, where we will be able to now action that and continue to drive-down third-party spend costs as well. And so I think we are \u2013 I think the trends will line up, there are just going to be some ins and outs or headwinds and tailwinds at any point, but we see a path to continue doing what we are doing, which is to drive expenses lower and lower year after year. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. And then during the quarter, you announced a venture with FNZ on servicing and the wealth management space. I am curious if you could talk a little bit about what the target of that venture is, they seem to have a really strong operation in Europe, what you bring to the table, what they bring to the table that will be great? Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Hey, Glenn, It\u2019s Ron. So FNZ has a very strong operating platform. It\u2019s target market is certainly in the U.S. would be the smaller end or a lower end in terms of size of market segment than we do in Charles River and CRD. So, it\u2019s quite complimentary to what we do. We would also \u2013 we would be their custodian and administrator as they move into that space. So, we view it as a way to expand into even further into wealth, a segment that we wouldn\u2019t naturally have leading capabilities in number one. Number two, they have got some really interesting technology that we want to continue to figure out how we can use elsewhere. So it\u2019s a way of getting some technology leadership that as well as a revenue stream at a relatively low cost for us. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I would like to follow-up on the Charles River commentary and the front-end fees versus that trail \u2013 and the trail dynamic. It sounds like that\u2019s a little less than half of this quarter\u2019s revenue. So wanted to confirm that\u2019s the case? And then is the on-boarding, you know, the installed the front end, is that a multiple quarter dynamic or is that a single dynamic? How does the trailer in those arrangements compared to the upfront? So, how should we think about the continuing revenue dynamic? And then how long are those contracts? And what\u2019s the typical retention rate? I just would love to get a better dimension for the cadence of those revenues if you can provide some of that? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it\u2019s Eric. It\u2019s fair to get into the details, because the details do matter. But as we do that, let me remind you, there is a range of details. And so let me try to answer the question that we can certainly follow-up with you and other investors that are curious, but this is a bit of the bankers working in a software space, which just operates in a different cadence with ASC 606. First, the recurring revenues, the SaaS kind of implementations are pretty straightforward. And I think I gave the numbers there. And I think you have got the right mix. The mix in each of these quarters has always been much more kind of SaaS professional services, the completely, I will call it completely stable revenues and those have been building nicely. And I think we are quite pleased with that trajectory. On the lumpier part of the revenues which is the on-prem \u2013 on-premise installations, the answer is there is a range of different situations, which have to do with different contract length. And so let me just give you a sense, contract lengths can range from call it 3 years to 8 years, right. And for those kinds of ranges, then you tend to get on 3-year contracts, you might get 70% upfront and then the other 30% over the rest of the 3 years comes in kind of year by year by year or quarter by quarter by quarter the effect or for something like that 7 or 8 year contract you will tend to get about 50% in the first year and then the other 50% in those 7 or 8 years ratably. And so there is a range, but I think it\u2019s I don\u2019t know it\u2019s contemplated to measure the revenues in a reasonable way. And you will have to talk with them if you like it or not, I can\u2019t really opine there, but that\u2019s the range. The upfront piece comes in, in a particular quarter and why is that because that\u2019s when the system literally goes live and it\u2019s beginning to serve clients. So, it becomes in service and it\u2019s the quarters after that through the length of the contract that you ratably see the rest of the revenues. What I do want to remind folks though is that once we have a client, the client retention in our business are very, very high. We retain most of our clients. And so, on a 3-year contract, you will the description that I just gave of 70% plus of 30% over the trail, 3 years later gets repeated, right? Same for a 5-year contract, 5 years out. And so in a way, we are little hesitant when people casually say, well, that\u2019s one-time it\u2019s not really one time, right, it\u2019s there is a good piece upfront, there is a good piece reasonably process that we have secured. And then there is almost always the extension, which brings the same thing again, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a little lumpier than that we would all like. So maybe I will pause there, but happy to talk more at the right time. Brennan Hawken : Well, one more piece of my question, I think that you might have forgotten, Eric, is the retention rate, what\u2019s the historical retention rate on those 3-year rates? Eric Aboaf : We can, I think it\u2019s very high. Why don\u2019t we \u2013 why don\u2019t we do a little follow-up and get that out to you in a Reg FD. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Eric Aboaf : But it\u2019s \u2013 we have been with part of our diligence of retention rates. Before I quote a precise number, let me come back to you, but it\u2019s very, very high. Brennan Hawken : Yes. Eric Aboaf : It\u2019s something that gives us a lot of confidence, because remember, once you have an on-premise installation like you have invested a lot internally as become a client side to integrate it with your state, with your other systems and subsystems. And so there is a willingness and there is an ability which together result in very, very strong, very high renewal rates. Brennan Hawken : Yes, okay. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Brennan, it\u2019s Ron. Maybe just to reinforce why that is, I mean, typically what goes on in these conversions is there is a pretty big and significant operating model change that goes on at the asset manager or the wealth manager. So typically, a new client is not that we are displacing somebody like Aladdin. Typically, it\u2019s a client that\u2019s got a bunch of bespoke and scattered technology. And they are moving to a comprehensive kind of system like this. So that\u2019s why you get very, very high retention rates, because frankly the switching costs on the client side are pretty high. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thank you for that. Appreciate all that color, Ron and Eric. And then following up on, you gave some great color and expenses. And I understand it\u2019s really hard to be too granular, Eric, to your point in the unusual operating environment that we are in, but I am going to give something a shot anyway. Have you reviewed your real estate footprint? Boston is a fairly expensive city. And when you look at your website, it seems like you have three different offices in the city. Is that really the optimal footprint based upon the experience that we have been seeing here, early read on the pandemic and the shutdown? Have you rethought the potential for remote or distributed workplace arrangements? How much do you think you can compress your occupancy expense over the next few years on the back of some of that? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it\u2019s Eric. Let me start on that to give you a little bit of kind of near-in views and Ron may play in as well. And in fact, I might ask your CFO the same question, when I see him next, because I think every CFO out there not just bank CFOs is wrestling with this specific question. Here at State Street, we have occupancy expense of about $435 million bucks. And we had already plans to drive it down this year by about 5%. So, taking a chunk out of that, and part of that is continued gratification of our high cost, location footprint, and taking advantage at the same time as some of the productivity, right, think both from the headcount management that we have done around the world as well. I think, I think in the very near term a couple things happen in real estate one is we just don\u2019t add any real estate and Ron and I put immediate halt. As soon as this pandemic happens, let me tell you, there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no that a halt is, is perpetual practically. If then, it does have a little bit of an effect where we can easily sublease. So, now what we are doing is going back to every lease that we have, and literally going through and asked him the question, when does it roll over? The question that it really wrestles through is what kind of occupancy rate can you operate add? And if you know most of us have operated at the \u2013 call it 85% to 95% occupancy rate. And I think what this pandemic has demonstrated is that the tools and the capabilities through technology and the methods that we have in a company, if we can, we can drive occupancy rates up to we are originally planning to 130%, 140% just by thinking about people\u2019s historic approaches to being in the office or not and I think that, that is kind of what gives us the view that, if we originally saw we could get to 120% occupancy rates. And now with a pandemic, we are confident, we could get to 150%. That\u2019s how you start to get some real leverage on the occupancy costs. I think the one thing that gets in the way of that and I am thinking of various kind of financial lens and we have to think about our people, our teams, our clients, and all the interactions and all that they do is we also need to be respectful of some of the social distancing requirements in the immediate term. And so I think what we have is we have a periods right now where, work from home is 90%, let\u2019s say, with social distancing, we can bring a certain number in. At some point, there is a vaccine. So the social distancing may not be at the same level as it is now and we have a whole group of employees who have learned to operate incredibly effectively work from home, some of whom prefer to be home. And so I think I think there is a lot to do here is I get the summary. I tell you we are already driving down occupancy costs. And I think the question that we will come back to in the coming quarters and in the coming year is how much more, it\u2019s not that they can\u2019t that they won\u2019t come down, they will come down. I think it\u2019s a question of scale off of that base of expense that I circled upfront. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Brennan, it\u2019s Ron. What I would add to that is in a fairly short period of time, we have gone through three kind of phases of work. Work from home was about a 1 week event for us and we got 90% of the people out of the buildings and into a home environment. We started about 3 weeks after that planning the return to office, which is in Asia-Pacific as you can imagine where it started back, also parts of Europe slower and you for all the reasons that we know. We have also launched the third phase of this, which is what we are calling the workplace of the future, which is encompasses a lot of things that Eric is talking about. To your point on Boston, as we had announced earlier, we are \u2013 we announced late last year that we are vacating this headquarters tower at the end of \u201822 going to move to a new building in Boston, but it\u2019s much more flexible, better terms, lower amount of space. And it\u2019s early enough now that we have ability to customize that even further given what we know about COVID-19. So, again, I don\u2019t believe that we could operate or should operate anything near 90% work from home, but we can operate in a much more flexible basis with work from home being an integral part of what we do it\u2019s certainly part of our disaster recovery now so you should start to see if shedding disaster recovery spaces, too. And you should expect and hold those two are a much lower for foot prints are really starting quite soon. Brennan Hawken : That\u2019s great, Eric and Ron, thanks for the color and of course, Eric happy to line up the discussion with my CFO, he can give you tips on how to deal with my annoying questions. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Brennan. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Kenneth Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. Good morning guys. Eric I was wondering if you give us a little bit more color underneath your full year fee outlook and I know given that you have got the CRD comments you talked about then and ask transaction activity but can you kind of walk us through how you are now seeing the bigger buckets move both sequentially and year over year given that we see average asset pricing we have in your earlier comments about the income pressure moderating? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Ken. Part of the reason we gave an overall fee guide is that there is always are and always going be some ins and outs in that in the various fees I think if you think about the different buckets the texture that I give against the full year guide 1.5% to 2% first on servicing fees I think we feel positive we\u2019ve delivered year on year growth in servicing fees now for the first quarter year on year and then the second quarter year on year and we think that will be a positive for the year and that\u2019s different I contrast that to previous years where we had more fee headwinds or where we didn\u2019t feel like we have the performance we would alike but we think servicing fees will be positive and that\u2019s without an average equity market uptick really because globally equity markets are kind of in a more flattish range management fees I think are doing well we have been a little more negative there we would like to do a little bit better than what we have done FX trading and then all the electronic services around that will be a clear positive FX lending a little lighter as we described some of the shift there but area that we are working on and then in the software and processing fees I think we are quite confident on the Charles river momentum especially with some of the recent win and then there is a kind of the there are some other in that line there are some other business activity or loan fees or other software fees etcetera then there\u2019s some of the lumpy stuff that we have to just take in Mark so all in all though full year 1.5% to 2% is what we see today. Which is I think it gives us the positive momentum that we live and then something to build on for next year and our view is if we can drive even low single digit fees upwards and continue to drive expenses down we are getting the right results. Kenneth Usdin : Yes. And one big picture one for Ron. Ron last quarter you talked about that a little bit of a push off in either installations and client discussions because of just everything that we are dealing with your win rate in servicing was about flat can you talk and you talked about the potential wins in the CRD side wealth management platform can you just talk about just the conversations that are happening now and how that\u2019s evolving just in terms of the core business and any sense that\u2019s starting to open up at all. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Kenneth. As we talked about last quarter we said that it was our sense that just given the additional challenges post to asset managers and asset owners operating models of COVID-19 but we thought that we would see even at some point an increase in conversations an interest in outsourcing and operating model changes in general and that\u2019s actually started to happen and was started to happen in a big way in the second quarter so we see continued interest in not just movement of back office to the lowest price much more about how do we comprehensively improve \u2013 how do we \u2013 the asset owner or asset manager comprehensively improved our operating model through changes to their back office, and even to their front office. So that\u2019s continuing. And it\u2019s we have, as I noted in my opening remarks as a result of that, we would expect to see and be in a position to announce some significant new wins between now and the end of the year. That are some combination of front, middle and back office of notable names. Kenneth Usdin : Got it. Thank you, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Hi, thanks guys. Good morning, Ronald and Eric. So, should maybe just building on the last comment, I wanted to big into share it a little bit more. As you think about the pipeline and CRD and sort of this sizable implementation opportunity you guys see, what percentage of that is the on premise versus kind of the SASB type of contract? And then secondly, I was hoping you guys could begin into the shared the wealth strategy a little bit broadly, thanks for some of the added disclosure there. But what kind of the \u2013 what are the typical sort of clients in the wealth management space that are warehouses is it a independent broker dealers and RIA. So, just a little bit more flavor there and which one of these channels incremental growth has been coming from? Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Why don\u2019t I start there? Eric can talk about the mix, Alex, but on the wealth channel, it tends to be the higher \u2013 the larger wealth managers. And it\u2019s a combination if I think about both, what\u2019s installed this quarter, but also what\u2019s \u2013 where we have conversations and we will be installing a future quarters. It\u2019s a combination of the warehouses and that obviously comes with lots of seats, as you would imagine, but also the larger private wealth managers, I mean, they could be RIAs, but again, it tends to be the larger ones and the larger names. And if you think why that is, oftentimes they are bringing, these institutions are bringing some fairly significant asset allocation capability to bear. And while they want to give their advisors, some freedom to customize, they also want to have a lot of control over that. And the CRD platform works really well. And in that regard. And as I mentioned, in response to an earlier question, the great thing for us is that this, it\u2019s it, it certainly is a bespoke application for the wealth segment, but it\u2019s leveraging, much of the same underlying technology. So there\u2019s a lot of scale and all this both in terms of the initial development we have done but also as we, as we roll out software improvements. Eric Aboaf : And Alex, just have round out on the financial fleet, we had a range of implementations of this quarter on the on premise side, that ones that are lumpier. The range was 3 years to 8 years. And it actually runs the gamut of 50% to 70% in the first year and then the balance ratably. I think the largest of implementations was that\u2019s going to be on the close to 8-year mark, which would be 50% in the first year and the other 50% in the coming year \u2013 in the coming years. Alex Blostein : Got it. Thanks. And then just maybe to round up the discussion around NIR, so Eric, your comment around kind of stabilizing NIR towards the end of the year, because that already contemplates significant reinvestment of liquidity that you guys have build up on the balance sheet into securities and loans or with a little more reinvest into \u201821? Could we maybe even see a little bit of growth from that sort of trough level of net interest revenues? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Alex, it\u2019s little early to get into 2021 to be honest, but with the guide I gave for 4Q does contemplate some reinvestment in the investment portfolio. And we are just kind of driving the balance both the long end range do have a kind of a tale of effects for us. And so in a way this is the time for us to add to the investment portfolio and do our work to offset what would naturally be a downward headwind, but I think we are \u2013 we have got a path. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see growth in NII at this point. We are both what we see a path to relative stability within a range, but it\u2019s going to take some work. And, we don\u2019t really know what happens with rates and how they evolve. But, we can we can see a path there. Alex Blostein : Yes, that makes us. Thanks very much. Eric Aboaf : Yes Operator : Your next question comes from line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Morning, Ron. Good morning Eric. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Good morning. Eric Aboaf : Morning. Gerard Cassidy : Ron, can you follow up on the new wins that you guys gave us this quarter? And you mentioned in your comments about the stickiness of not losing customers, and the wins primarily coming from existing customers where you are adding more products and services and in the cases where you win a new customer? I think you alluded to the lower prices, but can you share with us is it price driven that the new customers are coming over or are there are combination of price and better products that you are offering them? Ron O\u2019Hanley: That\u2019s right. I don\u2019t remember referring to lower pricing and in the context of the wins, But to answer your questions, it\u2019s a mix that we are seeing and right now I\u2019m referring to the, what we call our alpha front to back platform in Charles River. It\u2019s a mix of, existing clients or new clients that we are seeing. And that\u2019s particularly true. As I look at the near-term, pipeline. So in for those existing clients, in effect, we are expanding our share of activity with them to use the vernacular expanding the wallet where we might historically have had a back office custody relationship. And we\u2019re moving to the middle of the funnel of this but beyond that, in the, kind of more traditional core business, we continue to see a fair amount of outsourcing there too firms that had historically done everything but custody inside where we might have been one or, or the only custodian or we are now reconsidering that and moving things like fund accounting out. Middle office would be another big part of that because in fact, our middle office business is the outsourcing of their back office and that solves lots of challenges for them, and we have learned how to scale that business. So that would give you a sense of all that. I mean, what has been pleasing about the pipeline as it\u2019s developed and again, given the comprehensive nature of what we do, these pipelines do take a while to move from when there\u2019s the first contact to the actual signing of the business, but what\u2019s pleasing about that is we are seeing a fair number of new clients there to us, and the, the attractive thing about that is to really get the full advantage of the front to back platform. We are able to show that, we can do the Charles River in middle office for you, but we are going to get real data advantages is having the full front to back. So it fuels growth in our traditional back office business. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then Eric I know it\u2019s not as material to your business as a traditional bank, but your loan portfolio you mentioned you exited some of the leverage loans. Two questions one, can you give us any color on the industries in which you do risk the balance sheet for him? And second, what kind of pricing. Did you see when you sold those leveraged loans? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Gerard. We are trying to be proactive here, right. The leveraged loan market has really moved up and down and a good day. And just finding some points where it might make sense. We de risked roughly about $160 million of balances of leveraged loans. I remember, one of the cinema chains was in that and we got out at a good price. I think the average pricing on the exits was around, I think around $0.92 I want to say, on the $1, so somewhere in that range, so we feel like we made some, good tactical decisions. It didn\u2019t cost us that much, because we would have had to build the reserve anyway for those. And that\u2019s why I said on that $160 million in cost that\u2019s effectively a net fix. But for the peace of mind and just trying to be careful because we are a trust and custody bank and that\u2019s our brand, we felt like it was a good trade and we will continue to selectively do that. But in truth, we feel quite good about this loan book. I mean, it\u2019s a most leveraged loans are in the indices are single B and below are the double B and sometimes even better. And so I think we are pretty confident here, but there is always something and we just \u2013 we are happy to be proactive and make some tactical decisions and that\u2019s what we did. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. So, you are guiding for better fee growth for this year, 1.5% to 2% versus down before, how much of that is already reflected in the first half results and how much should be coming in the second half? You mentioned servicing fees, management fees FX processing, but is this mostly reflecting what you have done already or is it mostly to calm? And as a subcomponent of that when it comes to CRD, I guess linked quarter revenues were up $45 million and pre-tax was up $42 million. So I guess that\u2019s about a 93% incremental profit margin. So that leads me to ask, are there some upfront revenues with the new business wins and in terms of timing between the revenues and the expenses, how does that work out? And then lastly, if I can throw it in there, you are going to be a client of CRD and how is that moving along back? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Mike. It\u2019s Eric. Let me take the first couple and then I think Ron will probably want to take the third. In terms of the full year guide, you are right, there is a number of different pieces to it. There was some pieces of the full year, 1.5% to 2% fee revenue guide that are driven by the first half of the year. And there is some that will be driven by I think continued progress in the second half. I think if you just go through the line items, servicing fees has been good for the first half and we expect them to continue to be good, but I that will be a continued story. Management fees largely because of market, I think a little lighter in the first half, we are hoping that they come in a little stronger on a year-on-year basis in the second half, FX obviously a first half story where the second half will not be there. Sec finance has been light for us in the first half. We are hoping for some and looking for some stability there and some sequential \u2013 some sequential stability, if not some little bit of uptick. And then you have Charles River where we obviously got a big part in the second quarter but \u2013 and that maybe end up being a little more first half weighted, but I think you are \u2013 you typically get performance in the fourth quarter of these software businesses, but we will see I think some activity there. So, a little bit of a mix, to be honest. On Charles River, the good question on the on-premise installation, in particular or the renewals, but I think it\u2019s really on a kind of combination of the new implementations. You do get some professional servicing fees where we build revenues and we incur expenses. And my recollection is those are fairly aligned, the accounting centers encourage us to do that. But there \u2013 I think the professional services tend to be billed as incurred. And then \u2013 and part of what I described is the more stable part of the revenues. And what we are finding is there is just there is professional services installation work that we do for kind of coming clients, clients that are not yet implemented, but are on their way to implementation. There is some during the implementation that last sprint and then there is clients behind that. So it\u2019s a bit of a mix to be honest, but something we can try to parse out a little more detail in future conferences or calls. Ron O\u2019Hanley: And Mike regarding, the last part of your question, which is State Street Global Advisors becoming a client of Charles River, they are actually becoming a client of of the full Alpha front-to-back platform, including Charles River. So it\u2019s a fairly comprehensive installments, it\u2019s underway. Alright. It\u2019s the inflation is happening. Mike Mayo : What \u2013 because you are going to be like that will be a nice showcase once you get that done as you say and we use that ourselves, you should use it too, kind of what inning are you in as far as implementing it internally? Ron O\u2019Hanley: I mean, I am somewhat speculating here now, but we are well over half installed is the way I would describe it. And again, it\u2019s not just installing Charles River, but it\u2019s moving the State Street Global Advisors back office to our middle office platform. It\u2019s accommodating some existing technology that they have in place too. So as you would imagine, it\u2019s a $3.1 trillion asset manager, it\u2019s pretty complicated, but it\u2019s well over halfway to one. And just one last clarification, Eric, so the CRD revenue, should we $145 million in the second quarter, I know this is going to be pretty granular, but is that coming that\u2019s kind of lumpy or were you not \u2013 we should extrapolate that out or how should we think about that? Eric Aboaf : No, it\u2019s lumpy. And Mike, that\u2019s why I was trying to give a little bit of color, but just to reaffirm, in that $145 million, we said they are kind of very recurring literally kind of recurring revenues of just over $80 million and then the balance is in the kind of lumpy category where you get these on-premise installations. I also \u2013 so you kind of have to take a piece of the lumpy and say there is always going to be lumpy, because we have 3-year contracts, 5-year contracts, 8-year contracts. And every quarter, every year, there is some of those contracts rollover. And so you are going to get a new lumpiness or you get new business that you add in the lumpy category. I also gave if you want another quarter as a contrast back a year ago, second quarter of \u201819 we have $90 million of total revenues. And I said we had about $65 million of the very kind of recurring SaaS and professional services revenues. And just a smaller piece of that was lumpy. So you can kind of think I think draw some lines and say the lumpiness \u2013 this is big lumpy, that\u2019s for sure, but there is only going to be some, but I think \u2013 I think hopefully I have given you enough on the kind of SaaS and professional services to let you extrapolate from there and then put in something in the models on the on the lumpy part. Mike Mayo : Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Jim Mitchell from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just we could talk a little bit a question on the new business wins you have had and the cadence and impact. If I look at new business to be installed, you have about a $1 trillion to go. That\u2019s been pretty stable since the big wins in 3Q 09s, I mean, 19s. So is it on these bigger wins? Does it just really take this long? Is there something unusual here and I guess going forward with the new business wins you have alluded to in the second half this year, is it a similar kind of time to install? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Jim, it\u2019s a good question. The \u2013 when you see this kind of to be installed backlog if you will, that typically reflects that there is multiple tranches of business. So, for example, it could be custody and fund accounting in middle office. And a custody conversion we can do very quickly, right. We have \u2013 we literally did some we were notified by a client that they wanted to move in the midst of the crisis. And we got it done intra-quarter, those moves quickly. And so oftentimes don\u2019t even show up in this backlog here. I mean, they would if it was carrying over to a quarter. What you are seeing here is clients, including some very large clients that have multiple tranches of business that they are either moving over from an existing provider or in some cases moving from an in-source to an outsource model. And again, that reflects the nature of our business. We are using our ability to do these kinds of outsourcing to actually drive not just the outsource business, but not to drive traditional core custody, which scales easily and is quite profitable to us. But that\u2019s how you should think about that is that in any given quarter, our new business wins will be some very traditional custody to custody kinds of things or fund accounting to fund accounting. But oftentimes, the backlog reflects it was much more comprehensive kinds of moves. Jim Mitchell : Right. And should we assume that those more complex deals have higher fee rate? Should we see a little bit more of a material impact on servicing fees when they close? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, what you should expect to see is that there is fees coming from more than one source right, the custody fee, fund accounting fee and middle office fee etcetera. So, that\u2019s how you should think about it. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja to JPMorgan. Your line is open. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Vivek, we can\u2019t hear you. Operator : Vivek, if you are on mute, please un-mute. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Are you there, Vivek? Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Ron O\u2019Hanley for closing remarks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, thank you operator and thanks to all of you on the call, who joined us. Thanks for the questions and we look forward to the follow-up. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we released our third quarter and year-to-date financial results. Let me start by saying how proud I am of our team members worldwide who continue to put our clients first and deliver strong results for our shareholders in these extraordinary times.  Turning to Page 3, our vision is clear and remains that of becoming the leading services and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the world's capital. Despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we continue our strategic pivot in investment services from being primarily a fund servicer to being an enterprise outsource provider, further enabled by our differentiated State Street Alpha platform. We are forging ahead with the implementation of our strategy, developing new business opportunities, and continuing to drive productivity improvements. As we successfully navigate the COVID-19 environment, we are operating against four priorities; one, delivering growth through deeper client engagement; two, improving our product performance and innovating; three, driving efficiencies through improved productivity and optimization; and four, supporting the financial system and planning ahead for our team members. I will provide you a short update on each of these areas before moving on to our results.  First, our clients are at the center of everything we do. This year we have proven that as a result of our strong operational capabilities we are able to effectively and efficiently on board new clients and install new assets in even the most volatile of market environments and we continue to see proof points of our operational excellence. For example, this quarter we successfully installed approximately 800 billion of investment servicing assets. This was accomplished while also driving sales and expanding the pipeline as demonstrated by the strong level of new investment servicing wins this quarter, which amounted to 249 billion. Our front to back Alpha platform drove approximately one third of these wins.  Of note, included in these wins was a front to back CRD middle office and core custody mandate with a large European asset manager that was not a pre-existing client relationship. Also, despite the challenges, we continued to expand in critical growth markets with the opening of a new office in Saudi Arabia to support our growing opportunities in the Middle East. Lastly, we continue to win new business and maintain a strong pipeline at CRD. For this quarter we more than doubled new bookings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. The institutional investor market is experiencing significant disruption. Our clients are facing increased pressures to effectively employ data to achieve better investment outcomes and drive efficiencies within their operating models. We are positioning ourselves strategically to meet our client's needs and help them with their own strategic pivot.  Second, product differentiation and innovation are critical elements of how we are driving revenue growth across the franchise. Clients continue to turn to State Street for our comprehensive and differentiated servicing capabilities. For example, we recently launched our new NAV Insight's product for our hedge fund clients. Elsewhere, the open architecture and interoperability of our platform will enable us to expand our capabilities and attract new clients by partnering with other service providers such as our recently announced partnership with SimCorp for the insurance segment in EMEA. At Global Advisors where assets under management reached a record level of 3.1 trillion this quarter, we continued to expand our product offerings including expanding our range of fixed income ETFs.  Third, we remain highly focused on driving productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model [and cost] [ph] efficiencies even during this challenging period. Companywide productivity and efficiency efforts in just the first nine months of 2020 have so far achieved growth savings of 5% of our 2019 year-to-date total expense base, excluding notable items as we continue to gain efficiencies through IT optimization as well as other measures. The efficiencies we gain from the optimization of our business model to date are enabling both margin expansion and further investments to support our operations, client needs, and technology innovation, including our ongoing investments in CRD and our Alpha platform. Last, throughout this crisis, State Street has supported the financial markets and our employees. Our human capital is critically important to our success. We have safely reopened most of our office locations across the world and have brought back critical functions that operate more effectively fuller part time in office but most of our workforce remains work from home. At the same time, we are planning for the post pandemic workplace of the future. We believe that enabling better productivity, innovation, and fostering cultural attributes that set us apart are critical to our success.  As many of you know, Global Advisors has long been a leader in its stewardship efforts and its focus on diversity and good governance with portfolio companies. We are also addressing racial and social injustice by improving the diversity and inclusion within our own organization and advocating for the same in our industry. This is critically important to our leadership team and we are taking a number of concrete actions aimed at reducing these injustices, including 10 specific actions we have committed to executing, which I encourage you to review on our website. Turning to Slide 4, we present our third quarter and year-to-date financial performance highlights. You will see that as we continue to implement our strategy and improve our productivity, these actions are bearing fruit. First, looking at our third quarter results relative to the prior year period, total revenue decreased 4%, largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, demonstrating the progress we are making as we work to reignite fee revenue growth as well as the year-over-year contribution from CRD.  Turning to expenses here again I am pleased to report that as a result of our continued productivity improvements, we have reduced both third quarter and year-to-date expenses by 2% excluding notable items. Productivity management is now a way of life for us and we will continue to build on this strong culture of expense management we have successfully established. On a year-to-date basis and excluding notable items, we have driven 3 percentage points of positive operating leverage, improved our pretax margin by 1.3 percentage points, and generated 19% of EPS growth relative to the year ago period. We have achieved these improved results in a very challenging operating environment, particularly the low interest rate environment that I just mentioned. Lastly, reflective of our business model our balance sheet and capital position are strong and we continued to operate with capital levels well in excess of our regulatory requirements. As we await the outcomes of the latest Federal Reserve stress test in the fourth quarter, given our strong capital levels and unique business model, we are considering a full range of capital return actions in line with Federal Reserve instructions and market conditions.  To conclude, despite the challenges of the current operating environment, we are navigating it well. We are implementing our differentiated front to back alpha strategy, developing new business opportunities, and continuing to improve our operating model, thereby driving productivity improvements. I am pleased that our third quarter and year-to-date performance demonstrate this and how we are making measurable progress in improving State Street's financial performance. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. To begin my review of our 3Q 2020 results I'll start on Slide 5. As you can see on the top left panel, during the third quarter we recorded good growth in both servicing and management fees. Our expense discipline continues to bear fruit too with total expenses down 4% year-on-year and 2% ex-notables. On the right hand side of the slide, you can see two notable items, including a small legal release this quarter. Separately and for comparison purposes only, we have also called out some of the noteworthy impacts within NII which I will discuss more in more detail shortly. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A increased to 11% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to a record $36.6 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client inflows, and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A also increased as a result of higher equity market levels and net new business installation's. AUM increased 7% year-on-year and 3% quarter-on-quarter to 3.1 trillion, also a record. Relative to the year ago period, the increase was primarily driven by higher period end market levels, coupled with net ETF inflows offset by some institutional net outflows. Our SPDR Gold ETF continued to perform strongly, generating 6 billion in net inflows this quarter and taking in a record 23 billion year-to-date. Quarter-on-quarter, AUM increased mainly due to higher period end market levels, partially offset by cash net outflows as very strong inflows during the first half of the year reversed with a recent risk on sentiment.  Turning to Slide 7, third quarter servicing fees increased 2% year-on-year including FX reflecting higher average market levels, increased amounts of client activity, and net new business only partially offset by pricing headwinds which continue to moderate. Servicing fees were also up 2% relative to the second quarter, including the effects of FX driven by higher average market levels partially offset by sequential normalization of previously elevated client activity. As a result of our commitment to clients and our strong operational capabilities, we have continued to close deals and successfully on board new client business throughout this pandemic. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize the statistics. On the bottom right panel, we summarize the actions we're taking to further ignite growth. In 2019 you may recall that we saw servicing fees declined 6% year-over-year probably as a result of elevated pricing pressure which is now moderating. We quickly intervened by rolling out a client coverage model to our top 50 clients, instilling pricing governance, launching the new Alpha front to back offering, and working more closely with our clients. The result was to not only stabilize servicing fees, but also begin to drive growth in servicing fee revenues, which are now up 2% year-on-year and year-to-date. The next phase is to extend our enhanced sales coverage model to another 150 clients, leveraging both country and regionally focused segment teams to further develop our pipeline. We think this is worth another couple percentage points of servicing fee growth over time as we saw across our top 50 clients.  Turning to Slide 8 let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Beginning with Global Advisors third quarter management fees increased 2% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, with a year-on-year performance largely driven by higher average market levels as well as net ETF and cash inflows partially offset by institutional outflows. For a complete view of our investment management segment revenues we've included a page in the addendum, which also includes fees we earn as a marketing agent as we do for our SPDR Gold ETF, which are booked in other GAAP lines. All in total investment management segment fee revenues increased 5% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter and the business segment margin reached 29% this quarter. With the third quarter complete, we anticipate that the likely impact of money market fee waivers net of distribution expense will be within the previously announced $10 million to $15 million range for full year 2020.  Turning to FX trading services, third quarter results were up 4% year-on-year, but were down 15% quarter-on-quarter as we saw the second quarter bump proceed. Securities finance revenue decreased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower client balances and lower agency reinvestment yields affecting the industry. Securities finance revenue was down 9% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of those lower yields. Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 21% year-on-year, but were 30% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to next as well as market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, we show a view of CRD\u2019s business performance and revenue growth. As you can see, we have separated CRD revenues into three categories; on premise, professional services, and software enabled revenues. The slide illustrates the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the 606 revenue recognition accounting standards for on premise and more importantly, it demonstrates the consistent growth in the more predictable streams of software as a service and professional services revenues. As a reminder, second quarter CRD standalone revenue of 145 million was primarily driven by a large wealth on premise -- implementation and several large asset manager renewals. This quarter CRD standalone revenue was a more normalized 99 million. Looking over a broader time horizon, you can see that total revenue, as well as the SaaS and professional fee revenue growth are strong, up 16% and 20% respectively. As we continue to invest in and expand the CRD platform, we are seeing good momentum in the business and we now expect full year CRD standalone revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII declined 26% year-on-year and 14% quarter-on-quarter. Excluding the impact of episodic and true ups, NII was down 20% year-on-year and 11% quarter-on-quarter. As a reminder, the year ago period included approximately 20 million of episodic market related benefits related to the FX swap mark-to-market and hedge effectiveness. This quarter\u2019s NII included a negative true-up as we recognized approximately 20 million from OCI to net interest expense related to the prior period transfers of securities from AFS to HTM. Year-on-year the change in NII was primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the impact of these two items partially offset by larger investment portfolio and loan balances. Relative to the second quarter the decline in NII was primarily driven by the impact of lower market rates, the roll off of MMLF balances, and this quarter's true up partially offset by a $5 billion expansion of the core investment portfolio, which was worth about $10 million of additional revenues.  On the right hand side of the slide, we show our end of period and average balance sheet trends. We currently expect to operate at around 190 billion of average deposits so that may actually increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As a result this puts us in a position to continue to consciously expand the investment portfolio in the coming quarters to mitigate the effect of the low rate environment.  On Slide 11 we've again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex-notable so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 3Q 2020 expenses were down 2% year-on-year, but up 1% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items but including the impact of FX. As we continue to concentrate on driving productivity improvements and cost management in a challenging environment, we reduce expenses across four of five GAAP lines, comp and benefits, transaction processing, occupancy and other relative to the year ago period. Information system costs remain lumpy but we continue to focus on technology optimization and are making good progress. On a year-to-date basis total expenses are down 2% ex-notables relative to the year ago period, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we reduce gross expenses by about 5 percentage points, which is partially offset by natural growth and reinvestment of approximately three points.  Moving to Slide 12, in the left panel we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio. The investment portfolio increased to 112 billion as we thoughtfully put more client deposits to work, even as MMLF Securities continued to run off as anticipated. You will see that we continued to maintain a high percentage of HQLA assets, and as the short dated MMLF securities matured, the average duration of portfolio extended to almost three years at period end. In the right panel, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with strong and elevated capital levels. As of quarter end our standardized CET1 ratio increased by 10 basis point quarter-on-quarter to 12.4%, driven by solid retained earnings only partially offset by modestly higher risk weighted assets. Tier 1 leverage ratio was improved by 50 basis points to 6.6% as a result of our higher retained earnings and lower average assets. Consistent with the restrictions imposed on large banks by the Federal Reserve, we made no common share repurchases in the third quarter and cannot do any in the fourth. As Ron noted, we are confident in our strong and elevated capital position and we will consider a full range of capital actions, including the resumption of share repurchases in upcoming quarters on regulatory and market conditions allowed. Turning to Slide 13, we've again provided a summary of our 3Q 2020 and year-to-date performance. Our third quarter results reflect our focus on not only stabilizing but also reigniting fee growth, as well as the obvious headwinds from the low interest rate environment. Both our third quarter and our year-to-date results show clear evidence of how we are successfully executing on our strategy to improve State Street's financial performance and create shareholder value all the while temporarily holding elevated capital well above our regulatory requirements.  Turning to the rest of the year outlook, throughout the pandemic I've discussed our outlook under a certain set of assumptions. Now with three quarters of the year behind us let me share with you our current thinking, but with the caveat that the macroeconomic could continue -- environment could continue to change. We expect global central banks will keep short rates at current levels and long end rates will stay at current spot rates through year end. We also assume that average global equity market levels for the remainder of 2020 will be flat to current levels. With that backdrop, we now expect that full year 2020 fee revenue will be up approximately 2.5% to 3% with servicing fees expected to be up approximately 2% for full year, both of which are up from our previous guide. Regarding NII given the impact of continued lower long end rates we still expect full year NII to be down approximately 15% in line with our previous guidance.  Turning to expenses, we have successfully transformed the expense base and remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and operational efficiencies. We therefore still expect that full year expenses will be down 2% year-on-year, excluding notable items as we continue to find ways to reduce expenses. In regards to our provision for credit losses, we continue to see a range of outcomes based on evolving economic conditions and any credit quality changes. On taxes we continue to expect our tax rate for the full year to be at the low end of our 11% to 19% range. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, let's open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Hi Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Hello there. So it's good to see that consistent and good new business growth, and I know that we get that on a gross basis all the time, but it looks good enough to be very positive on a net basis. I don't know if I can get you to comment on that, but the follow on questions that I have is it's also good to see the pricing moderation over the last couple of quarters in your conversation. The question I have is how do you know how durable that is, meaning how much of the book has gone through it, the confidence in what the pricing committee is doing, the next 150 clients, and then can clients just stick you up next year too, I just -- I'd love to get your -- just the overall feeling of confidence that we can keep this trend going in the right direction? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Thanks Glenn, it is Eric. Let me start on pricing and then we can cover the broader topics of pipeline and momentum. I think on pricing, we continue to feel that the actions we took right, literally centralizing and turning pricing into a very senior conversation internally here and management process for one have made a real difference in a practical way. And so while you turn back the clock and you see that historically this industry has always had some pricing compression, literally, because there's always appreciation in our fees due to markets, right, so there's always a natural balance that we play out with our clients. You know that history was in the range of 2% per year. We saw that expand to 3% and 4% headwind last year, which obviously was not something that we want to or expect to repeat. This year we thought it would be down to 3% and we updated our view that it'll be down at around 2.5% for the year.  And I think the perspective that we have is that that is largely due to a more heightened set of actions, governance, education to be honest, both of our team and clients. I think what happens next will, you know, time will tell. But I think there is not only the continuation of our intensity and actions here, but I think the other feature is that as our value proposition offering that kind of front to back offering, which connects the Charles River, the middle office, the [indiscernible] accounting becomes a bigger part of what we offer. Those contracts tend to be longer, they tend to be more integrated, they tend to be stickier and we think that's going to continue to provide some support to the pricing benefits that we've accrued and at least keep us at this level. If we can do better let me tell you, we will lean hard into that. But I think we're confident where we have gotten to and operating in this area. Glenn Schorr : Okay, so I couldn't get you on the net new business that's cool. Maybe Ron last one for me is you mentioned considering the full range of capital return options which is cool, you got a lot of capital to consider options on. You particularly have had a good long history in consolidation on the asset management side. I'm just curious your take of or observation on what's going on in the industry and if there's room for State Street to participate, not that you're not already a huge player? Thanks. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, I mean, your observation is accurate. There's a heightened amount of consolidation going on. We think about it from two dimensions, not just as an asset manager, but also as a servicer to asset managers. So it's something that we're looking at carefully. We're always looking at our two businesses, investment services and investment management and trying to determine how we best optimize them and we like what we have. But to the extent to which we could add to it through some kind of a tuck in we will consider that also. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks for all that. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alexander Blostein : Great, thanks for the question. Good morning, everybody. So Ron, just maybe building on the last point around a pickup in asset management industry M&A obviously with Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley and there's been speculations that there could be others. How do you think about that from a service provider perspective? Obviously, on the one hand, I could see how that could be a net positive, given you guys are kind of in a sweet spot with sort of large global kind of giants, as you described them in the past. So perhaps maybe more volume, but pricing could come under pressure, given kind of the benefits of a larger platform. So help me think about that, is it a net positive or net negative for State Street that we see more consolidation in the asset management space and then specifically with respect to Eaton Vance and Morgan Stanley, any risk or opportunities from a revenue side you guys see for yourself, I don't know to what extent you provide services to either? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, so we're not going -- I'm not going to comment on any specific client situations, it's public that we serve both of them, but I'm not going to comment on that, Alex. But in terms of the impact on us, there's some negatives but there's also a fair number of positives. The negatives, obviously would be if we lost a client or if we consolidated but ended up at a different spot on the aggregate fee schedule. The positives are that in most of these situations we often are involved in some way right from the beginning, because of our knowledge of asset managers, our ability to help with operating models, the fact that we now have this front to back Alpha platform so there's -- we're often there at the table or certainly brought to the table quickly thereafter. The other thing that we believe we can stimulate with all this is if you're going to go through all the integration, you might as well go through a platform upgrade. And so we think that in some ways this is actually going to spur activity because oftentimes the synergies that are being promised or looked for have to do with the back office and operations and you're going to get even more synergies if you actually take the opportunity to overhaul the operation and have a true front to back kind of implementation done. So positives and negatives, but we think over time, probably more positives for us. Alexander Blostein : Great, thanks. And the follow up question for Eric around NII. So just to clarify that down 15% NII for the full year to get in line with prior, does that include the $20 million true-up in the quarter and sort of you're talking about this on a reported basis, which I think implies about $480 million for NII for Q4 so just double checking that? And then more importantly, how do you guys think about that runway developing into 2021? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric. Yeah, we did do it on a reported basis that the 15%. So I think your estimate of what we're looking at for fourth quarter is in the right area. I think the way I describe this is first to describe this year and then maybe talk a little bit about next year. We've clearly been in this interesting environment that that fell sharply and what we're finding is that at this point we're starting to really slow the decline or the pace of decline of NII quarter-on-quarter-on-quarter. And so, you saw in our results this quarter, adjusted for the true-up will come back there if necessary down 11% sequentially. If you actually just open up the lens and say, how much was NII down first quarter to second quarter, it was down 16%. So we started at 16% 1Q to 2Q. This quarter we are at down 11% on a kind of underlying basis from 2Q to 3Q.  And to your point if you take our full year guidance and you've done the math like many others, we're looking down at around 4 maybe 5 percentage points from 3Q to 4Q. So you can see that pattern consistently slowing and that's really the effect of the kind of grind through the portfolio coming through, which slows over time offset by our actions to expand the asset side, whether it's loans, the investment portfolio, which I said was up 5 billion on average for the quarter. It's actually up 9 billion on an end of period basis. And then some expansion of what we're doing in that sponsored repo program. So, those are the puts and the takes.  As we look at next year it's a little early. But, our view is that that pace of reduction continues to slow and so we're probably looking at a couple percentage points from 4Q into 1Q or 2Q and then we see some stabilization at that level. And so I think you've seen us now really intervene and slow the decline. We'll see stabilization in 1Q or 2Q and then I think at that point, we can offset the grind down from the portfolio. Alexander Blostein : Very well, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow up on that actually, Eric. The couple of percentage points from 4Q levels, does that utilize the same underlying assumptions that you laid out initially spot basically keeping spot rates unchanged and then also given the level of importance mortgage backed securities have on your portfolio, what assumptions are you making for prepayment rates or are you just holding those steady, are you assuming that they use a little bit what are -- what's embedded there, just so we can calibrate [moving forward] [ph]? Eric Aboaf : Yeah Brennan thanks for the question, because each of those assumptions are very important, right. We're looking for this working -- looking for and driving towards an inflection here. So first on rates, I think we're looking at current short rates, which have become a little more normalized. Remember, we had an inversion between repo and treasuries, which now is normalized. So that's slightly beneficial. We're hoping that continues, that stays that way. And long-end rates in the 70 to 80 basis point range, they've been bouncing a good bit over the last week or so. So that's the broad assumption. I think, as you think about the assumption on MBS pre-amortization, prepayment speeds, we are assuming that third quarter and fourth quarter are at a more elevated level of prepayments and then we do expect some amount of burnout into first quarter, second quarter and going forward. And so that is an underlying assumption. We think that's a fair assumption given a look at the models and we obviously get models from the three to four providers and have our own assessment as well. But it is driven by that.  And then finally it'll be -- our performance will be dependent on the pieces that we can control. You know you've seen us expand our loan book. Our loan book, which is exceedingly high quality for our clients is up about 10% year-on-year. You see our investment portfolio is also up about 10% year-on-year. And, our sponsored repo [Audio Gap] and so our view is that we have more of those deposits can be put to work, whether it's the loan book or the investment portfolio over the course of a couple of quarters. And here you could see even this quarter, I gave you a sense for the difference, it makes a real difference and it lets us kind of lean in and drive this stabilization. Brennan Hawken : Excellent. Thank you for all that color, Eric. That's great. And then shifting gears to the servicing revenue, you referenced some new business installations. We saw also the sort of repeatedly [ph] of the equity market rally. And in the past, sometimes that has resulted in some -- the way the Street calculates your servicing fee rate to compress just because of the mix not all of your servicing mandates and contracts are purely based on asset levels. And so could you maybe help us unpack a little bit how much of the lag, how much of the servicing fee is not going up as much as the AUC/A was lags from new business installations where the revenue has not yet come on and how much of it might be from the market rally which naturally would only be partially captured due to some of those contract dynamics? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, let me Brennan take that from a couple of different angles, right. Equity markets are clearly a tailwind for our business and there's always a little bit of timing, but let's -- that's kind of the timing is really rounding. What's important really here is the average equity markets and the average equity markets across the globe, right. So if you step back, S&P is up 12%, 13% year-on-year. But the emerging markets are up, the international EMEA markets are actually down a smidge year-over-year. So it's the mix of those that matters. And then not only the EOP matters, but the average matters and so on average year-to-date we've got equity markets at up around 6%, which is beneficial. We've always talked about equity markets up 10, fees up 3. Fixed income markets up 10, fees up 2. And so we do have a tailwind of a point, maybe a point and a half of fees that are coming through on a quarterly basis or year-to-date basis and we'll take that.  Over and above that I think we've also got some net new business and so, to the question that came earlier and that folks are always asking about are our business wins are outpacing some of the bit of turn that you always get in the portfolio. And then we've been able to charge more on whether it's client activities or flows have been a little more positive this year. And those are coming through and offsetting some of the fee headwind. So I think there's a good mix in general if equity markets stay at this level, that'll help us with the compares on a year-on-year basis. But remember, third quarter to fourth quarter of 2019 equity markets were up as well, right. And so that'll help us on a sequential basis from 3Q to 4Q but year-on-year, we're also going to have a tougher comparison there as well for 4Q to 4Q. Anyway, there's a lot there, which is partly why I gave the overall fee guide for this year on servicing fees up 2% because we think that's a good indication of a bit of a tailwind then in equity markets around the globe. But also driven by our ability to drive new business growth, manage pricing, and then take advantage of some of the flows and activities that we're seeing. Brennan Hawken : Appreciate that Eric, but just the lag in new business billing versus the AUC/A coming on just what -- is there a lag with some of that, sometimes there is and so I just wanted to confirm, appreciate all that, that's a great color on the market dynamics and the beta? Eric Aboaf : There is a bit of a lag but I think the EOP and the averages were relatively consistent for the quarter. And so we're not expecting a large lag adjustment into the fourth quarter at this point. There will be a little bit but because of the end of period and the quarter, the average was pretty consistent. I think it'll just play through more naturally. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for clarifying that. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Hi, good morning guys. Eric, I want to just come back to the capital return question, you have an 8% CET1 minimum. Just wondering if you can just level set us again now that SUB is totally done, we have the stress test ahead of us and the limitation through 4Q, what do you guys see as your limiting capital ratio and when you are able to get back into buybacks, do you go back to 100% capital return and how do you think about like what the actual excesses over just getting back to a more normal buyback plan? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Ken it's obviously an important topic we've been working through. In a way we've gotten to been forced to defer any of those decisions. But I tell you, it's one that we're anticipating and eager to act upon given how strongly capitalized we are. I use the word elevated capital purposely in my prepared remarks just because that's what we're running at, right. We've got significant headroom. I think there's a couple of parts to the question. So, I think first in terms of our capital ratios, binding constraint, it is now CET1. So, core risk weighted assets divided by common equity, Tier 1 capital. At this point, the leverage ratio is not really any more of a binding constraint. And you've seen us take advantage of that as we've reduced some of the stack of preferred on our book. And then as you think about CET1 ratio, we'd like to get that down. I mean there's very little reason that we should run above 12%. There's little reason we should run above 11%. And so there's at least 0.5 if not more. We're working through what's appropriate because we've got a lot of data over the last couple of quarters. So we want to factor in but there's a solid billion and half of capital there that needs to go back to shareholders over and above what would go back to shareholders just from the earnings that we create each quarter. And so, we obviously want to see the results I think as the Fed and market participants do of the new CCAR test. We went through all the assumptions, as I think you guys did too. And we think we'll show well. We're very comfortable with our SEB and I think what we'll do is kind of market dependent and also based on any Fed guidance for the industry we'd like to restart capital return and if we can do that in the first quarter the pace of that needs to be a little bit paced. It got to be careful in this environment. And we're careful bankers, after all. But our view is that we need to start and then we need to accelerate that pace of return so that we return more than what we earn each quarter and start putting that back into our shareholders hands. Kenneth Usdin : Great, great color, thanks. And just to follow-up on expense question, you've been talking for a good while now that you think that the company should be able to take expenses down annually. And I know we'll hear more about this when you get to your formal outlook for the year. You did a very good job this year, still being at about down 2%. With the NII still being a headwind but fees looking better, how do you start to just think about that calibration and where are you in terms of just the ability to continue to net down the expense base? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah Ken and I appreciate your letting us answer that now and then as you say in January we'll give our annual guidance. I think I've been clear, I think we've all been clear here from the management team that down in expenses is the right direction of travel. And the direction and the volatility we've seen in market interest rates just reaffirmed that down is the new up and that's the kind of way we should operate in this environment. And I think what you've seen is us being able to do that now for effectively two years in a row. We did that last year if you adjust for the acquisition costs of CRD, we're doing that again this year. And I tell you, we have a lot of confidence in that momentum partly because that frame of mind, I think, has really kind of organically expanded through not only our management team, but our one downs and two downs. So we've got hundreds of people, hundreds of senior folks working on productivity and expenses all the while driving revenue growth and fees and so forth as you noted. But we're finding ways to do that across the line items, right. You saw four out of five of our expense line items down year-over-year and many of them were down quarter-on-quarter as well. And I tell you in our four operations area we continue to find ways to automate and reduce manual touches. And we think that has years of opportunity for us in technology we are driving a transformation and we've been clear there. And I think more broadly across our corporate functions or businesses, the notion of productivity kind of more outcomes per person is something we're actually adding measurement tools on so that we can in a more incisive way find opportunities. And I think that's why you've seen even with the pandemic, our comp and benefit costs are down 2% year-on-year. Even more if you adjust for the currency swing, our occupancy costs are down. And every one of those is a result of those pretty broad based and deep actions. Kenneth Usdin : Great, thanks, Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Elizabeth Graseck : Hi, good morning. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Morning, Betsy. Elizabeth Graseck : I wanted to just take in a little bit on the wins that you've been announcing recently, there's been several press releases on servicing wins for semi-transparent EPS. And I just wanted to understand how you think about the market opportunity there and how we should be expecting that's going to be impacting fee rates as they come in and what kind of time frame it takes from announcement to fully loaded and in the plant? Thanks. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, so I think it's fair to say Betsy that virtually every active manager is thinking about these and there's a lot of work underway in many asset management firms. There's basically five firms have come out and actually launched them and I'm not sure what the total is. Most firms have much multiple funds, but of the five firms that have come out, we're servicing four of them. And I think that you'll find that many others, as I said, are looking at this and also many are looking at what's the experience of those that have gone first. So I think many firms view this as a potential new revenue opportunity in that case and to the extent that growth [ph] will be an opportunity for us. We have from a servicing and a servicing innovation perspective we've been on this now for a while. We're familiar with all the different ways of doing it and in effect are servicing most of the ways if not all the ways of doing it. But I think it's too early to tell whether or not this will be a game changer, but it's certainly something that we felt like was important enough that we needed to put some innovation against it. We have -- we've got great market share at this point, but on a market it is small and growing. Elizabeth Graseck : And then just thinking about how you -- the fee rates associated with it, is it something that's going to impact the overall fee rate, is it like lower than traditional fee rate type of products or not, I'm not sure how it's priced? And then the other question is just how long does it take from an announcement to be loading up into the plant, is it like a two or three quarter loan or it's just growing with the product itself, which has made sense? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, so I mean, the fee rate is higher but it's rate times volume. And I would say so far the volumes are -- they're growing but off of a very low base. So I think it's just too early to tell whether or not this will be a game changer for us. But again, our view was that it wasn't something we should ignore. We really -- because we spent time on it right from the beginning, we'd actually worked on some of the rulemaking around it with the SEC. We felt like it was something we should step into and we'll just see where it develops. Not being evasive, we just don't know. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay, and since the investment has been made it would be a relatively high margin as these wins coming on to your platform? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, I mean certainly to the extent to which any of the existing funds grow. Yes, high margin, we understand all the different models. So our -- what it takes for us to install them, I mean we understand it now. So it's not like a lot of new incremental costs. Elizabeth Graseck : Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Just one clarification before I ask the question, the tax rate Eric that you mentioned, that should be 17% to 19% for 2020 at the low end, do I have this number correct? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, that's correct, 17% to 19% was the guidance. And we've reaffirmed that we're coming in at the low end of that range. Brian Bedell : That the guidance or the number. Okay, good. And then first question is on CRD, the low double-digit revenue guidance for 2020 to comprise a little over 100 million for 4Q. Just wanted to make sure that thinking about that correctly? And then as we move into 2021 given the new wins that you're seeing and the momentum you see on the Alpha platform, I guess maybe an early look of what you're thinking for core CRD in 2021 in terms of that growth rate potentially even accelerating from that low double digit or around the same or lower? Eric Aboaf : Yeah Brian, on CRD I don\u2019t want to get out ahead of myself for 2021. We're still doing the pipeline assessment growth and so forth. I got to tell you is that we're quite pleased with the growth that we've seen here. You know we bought a business that had top line growth of 7% a year. Last year we nudged that up to 8%, that was our first year of ownership. And this year we're looking at low double-digits with some upside relative to where we were a couple of months back. And you saw some, I think, some impressive wins in the second quarter with in the wealth space and some major renewals that kind of give you a sense for the kind of the effect of the State Street backing software offering has on the market and our ability to convert that into some significant adds to revenue. Now, we'll have to lap ourselves next year. So that's obviously going to be the hard part quarter by quarter by quarter. And so we're doing all the things you'd expect us to do. We're expanding the sales force, we're expanding the technical base, we're expanding the implementation engineers. But I think we're real pleased with the trajectory and just a double-digit revenue performance two years into an acquisition. I think it gives us the confidence that not only did we buy the premier property in the space, but under our ownership it's very strong and on a top line basis. And that's just CRD itself, right. CRD is really part of that front to back Alpha offering and you've seen us expand that with partnerships, win business and custody and accounting and middle office with Charles River, and so I think that broader effect on our offering and our client discussions is shaping up nicely as well. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Brian, I want to underscore that last point that that Eric just made, because we've been talking to you all right from when we acquired Charles River. We closed it in October of 2018 and we started talking about how the pipeline was developing for not just what we -- Charles River, but also for a broader front to back kinds of offerings. You'll note that in our new business wins this year of this quarter, a third of those wins were Alpha related. So remember, that means that it's not just a CRD win but we're getting out of that some form of the middle office and the back office. And we said that we were seeing it develop, we said that not only would we drive what we drive CRD wins off of our existing custody platform, but that we saw CRD and the Alpha platform as potentially driving back office wins. And we're starting to see that. I noted that one of the Alpha wins was large European asset manager that we had no existing relationship with before. So we've gone -- we'll go from zero to having CRD, the middle office, and front services. So that's how you should think about CRD both in and of itself as a software provider, but also as part of this alpha platform and I will pivot to being an enterprise outsourcer. Brian Bedell : Yeah, that's great color. And then maybe just Ron, have you on some growth initiatives. ESG obviously you guys are very strong and [Technical Difficulty] AUM, maybe if you can talk about what the plan might be to launch more products that sustainably focused product, maybe especially on the ETF side, and obviously we have seen BlackRock related space and then also on the servicing side, to what extent within your data analytic offerings are you able to integrate ESG data and analytics services for your client? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, I mean, you've outlined it well in terms of how we think about it. Most of the -- much of the visible ESG activity to date has been in SSGA and in addition to all the stewardship work that they do, there's been much new product and more new product on the drawing board. What's as exciting for us though is that if these managers are now integrating ESG into their overall investment risk framework and overall portfolio construction that's driving more and more needs for measurement, data analysis, etcetera. So we've got a series of products that we're working on now that will help support that. So stay tuned on this. It's something that's very important to us. We're actually -- we're even thinking about it in terms of how we put our resources together across the firm on this and go out on a united front. So you'll see more of this in the next few quarters. Brian Bedell : Okay it is Great. That's great color. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier from Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael Carrier : Good morning and thanks for taking the question, just a quick one on the 150 clients you mentioned reviewing and working on, is there any difference it was this group versus the prior 50 that could create a different outcome? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: No, I think what's -- the way we think about it, Mike, is that we rolled out a more sophisticated and engaged and kind of action oriented coverage structure on the top 50 starting at the end of 2018 and that's really took effect this year. And that's about folks with a kind of a sales orientation, with a deep relationship, kind of building orientation, a sophistication to leverage the whole organization and bring it to bear to our clients. And what I tell you is that that actually has created at least several points of additional fee growth for that group over and above what we're seeing for the rest of our client base, right. And so as we step back, we're saying, wow, given that that has created differential amounts of revenue growth and we track it, right, we track the top 50, we track the rest of the client base and then we further sub segment below what we've decided to do is take the learnings. Now, you don't take them kind of pound for pound because there's a cost to a coverage organization. There is productivity and loading that you want to think about with a coverage organization with different sized clients. But, the client base, the next 150 clients are not dissimilar from the largest or just tend to be maybe in one or two investment areas if they're servicing clients as opposed to three, four or five. They may be $50 billion or $100 billion clients instead of trillion or $2 trillion clients. But these are our clients in the next 150 are large, their scale, they can take advantage of our custody, accounting, middle office, front office services. And so I think they're similar in a lot of ways. And that's why we think that in a more intense and orchestrated coverage organization, which really then has the ability to unleash another several points of revenue growth there, can then help lift the overall revenue growth of the franchise in a way that we've already seen for the top 50. Michael Carrier : Got it. Alright, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So Eric wanted to start with a question on the securities portfolio, the duration increased sequentially, it now sits at about 2.9 years and there will be a little bit of a surprising development just given the accelerating prepayment activity. Now some investors and admittedly not all, but some are speculating we could see some steepening in the curve in the event of a blue wave and various inflationary programs are launched. And I know that outcome is not contemplated in the NII guide, for some of you could just speak to how you're handicapping extension and AUC/A risk, maybe you could just frame the capital and duration sensitivity if we do see 50 or 100 ways of steepening? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Steve it's Eric. Those are exactly the kind of the balancing -- the balancing drivers that we are quite careful of. To your point we model out all the uprate scenarios, 50, 100, 150, 200 and what you've seen us do is both be, I think, considered in how much maturity and duration we've put on. We've historically run at this 2.5 to 3 year range of duration. So I think we're within that band. We added a little more to offset some of the shortening that came on MBS prepayments. So we did that consciously, but we also didn't see us take that up to four or five-year duration and run long on 10 year and 30 year bonds. So I think it's calibrated. One of the tools we use here, though, is not only to think about where we play on the curve, right where this is really the middle part of the curve. This is five and six-year maturity paper on average with some a little longer. But, we're careful. But we also use the HTM accounting designation because a lot of what we hold we'd like to hold for to maturity. And you've seen us put 40 billion, 45 billion of securities and health to maturity, which insulates it from the OCI pressure. And we do that very, very consciously. And we also are quite purposeful in what we put in to maturity, because we think that's got to be pristine. It's government paper, it's government guaranteed paper. And so that's how we balance the uprate scenarios, is through a mix of kind of just carefulness on duration and then the HTM accounting. And I think in a lot of ways that lets us feel comfortable that, we always need a volatility buffer in capital, but we don't want to have one that's inordinately large because then we couldn't return capital to shareholders. And, that's why earlier in some of my remarks, I described that there's a solid amount of capital to give back. We need to keep some for the OCI volatility, but we think we can manage that to a reasonable levels, given the portfolio design and some of the accounting designation. Steven Chubak : Hey, thanks for that color, Eric. And maybe just as my follow-up, just wanted to ask on the investment management strategy. The segment did see a nice lift in pre-tax margin this quarter for the profitability has consistently lagged some of the traditional asset management peers. And just with the latest wave of consolidation now how are you thinking about scale adequacy of the platform, especially on the active side, and just given more subdued profitability, as well as a significant capital cushion arc that you cited, just how may you look to reposition this segment to compete more effectively and I guess more specifically, how does an organic growth fit into that strategy? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, so it is Ron. These are exactly the questions that are very much on our mind and that we're working through quite actively. We'd like the franchise, it's got some terrific assets to it, particularly the ETF franchise. And you're seeing more and more that that's an area where the big are getting bigger and it's just hard if you're not in a top three or four position there. But it also has its challenges, right. It's a fairly narrow platform from a product perspective. So it operates really at the beta, the active beta and quad beta and is relatively small and things like alternative. So thinking about it from a product perspective, both organic and inorganic. And then obviously from a distribution perspective, it's the only distribution we have is our institutional distribution. So, we'll probably talk more about this at some of the upcoming conferences as we finish through our work. But it's something that we're actively considering and evaluating. Steven Chubak : Great, look forward to hearing more about it. Thanks so much, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Harte from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Jeffrey Harte : Hi, good morning. Can you talk about the value of kind of deposits to State Street and I guess I'm thinking about it from the angle of with deposits up a lot, 20% from year-over-year, NIM as low as I can ever having remember seeing it. And you're holding a bunch of capital events, the balance sheet is just kind of swollen with these deposits. At some point in time it has become economically advantageous to kind of turn deposits away, say, through pricing and delever the balance sheet, return more capital to shareholders, assuming the Fed lets you buy stuff back? Eric Aboaf : Jeff it is Eric. Those are all the right questions that we -- that I think we as bankers have to navigate through. I think what's changed and is particularly important for us as a bank is that the binding constraint for us has actually shifted. Two, three, four years ago, it was around leverage and probably around Tier 1 leverage, probably around supplementary leverage ratios, right which have an expanded kind of view of the balance sheet. And those rules though were effectively adjusted over the last year I think in such a way that they became more rational and didn't put us in this position where we needed to any longer push away client deposits, which is something we did do. I remember in 2017 that was one of the actions that we took and it wasn't very pleasing to us or to our clients. But we're no longer in that position. What's really changed now is that it's the common equity Tier 1, the risk weighted asset ratios that really matter, both the spot ratio, then under CCAR and the FCB. And because of that shift, we were effectively in this position where we're open for business on deposits. And while in a kind of -- in a way it's a larger balance sheet, it's 20% larger, that's not constraining for us. And what that does put us in a position to do is to carefully expand the investment portfolio. You've seen us do that this year, continue to lend more to our clients, and you've seen us do that as well. And so that's the path we're taking, which I think actually supports the financial system in the right way as we lend and expand the investment portfolio, it supports our clients and to be honest, that'll come back as earnings and returns to our shareholders. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Jeff, what I would add to that is many of these deposits, to the extent to which we push them away, we create operational complexity for our clients because most of these deposits that we get are associated with our custody activities. So when you start to separate those, you're creating some operational complexity. And Eric noted that we did some of this mostly in year 2016, 2017, and it would be hard for us to get those deposits back if we did that too. So, if you believe that these are going to be useless forever, it might be something that you'd be willing to do. But given the lack of constraint, given the fact that it creates operational complexity for our clients and given -- and to retain that optionality if and when, in fact you do see a steepening of the curve or even increase in rates, we like our approach. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, the current approach drives 85 basis point of spread income effectively on those deposits because many of those are actually priced at zero or one basis point. Not as much as we'd like, but to be honest, that's remunerating to the income line and to our shareholders. And over time, there will be some normalization of rates, we could see that expand again. Jeffrey Harte : Okay, and just a quick kind of bigger picture follow up. It's probably too soon to tell, but have you seen or do you expect to see any impact kind of versus the pre-COVID environment in servicing and as far as kind of the trend of industry consolidation or maybe even pricing pressure do you see things changing because of with the whole work at home and just everything we're kind of facing now versus a year ago? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: I think the trend that's most visible to us at this point is that investment managers, even asset owners of sovereign wealth funds plan sponsors are really taking a hard look at their operating model. They were before, if anything this has put more spotlight on those operating models. I mean, we had instances where we had clients, the example I'm thinking of was an asset owner had roughly 1700 employees and had the ability to have 70 of them working from home from a technology perspective. So there's a broad based look at operating models, which we think will be beneficial to us. You know, ultimately, as long as you believe that investment markets are going to continue to function and grow what we do will still be there. What we're positioning ourselves strategically for is that as these operating models need to be overhauled, we want to be the enterprise outsourcers there that's doing it for them, taking on as much as we can of the front, middle and back office. Jeffrey Harte : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi Eric and Ron, couple of questions for you folks. Firstly, can you give an update on you've had a good run with the internal [ph] revenue growth as you mentioned. Can you give an update on where you stand on the synergies that you've achieved and accretion dilution? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, in fact we continue to run well along those lines. I think we had said that accretion would turn positive by the end of the second year. We effectively have gotten to that point, given that the synergies have come in both on the revenue and the expense side. I think the expense synergies came in actually a little faster than expected. I think we've always historically been good at expenses as a company. And the revenue synergies have come in quite nicely. They've moved around a little bit. We had some synergies from some of our sponsored repo activities sold into the CRD base, which came in a little lighter because of the compression in rates. But some of the fee activity that we have and the sales activity that came from the State Street franchise have come in stronger. You saw the very significant wealth of when and some of the other activity. So I think we're really pleased with where we are and has hit our milestones. Vivek Juneja : Thanks on that, a couple of different one, Eric, for you. The reverse repo business, you know, it's been shrinking, you've shrunk quite a bit. The last couple of quarters the spreads have diminished. Do you see it shrinking further or is it stabilizing, what are you seeing in spreads, any color on that? Eric Aboaf : You know, the sponsor repo business is something that we've done. It started small, it got to 50 billion, 75 billion, 100 billion of assets, it got north of that. Sometimes it's spiky. We had months or we're at 150 billion. We're back now in the kind of $80 billion to $90 billion range. And the biggest driver has been the changes in front end rates, right. Repo rates and kind of one-month T bills tend to create movements in positions of asset managers who are very focused on overnight out through one-month paper. And, because T bills were suddenly more attractive during really the spring and part of the early summer, we saw that that sponsored repo balances come back down. We've now seen some, I think, normalization in those rates. I think they're back to being 5 to 10 basis points a part. We think that gives us some opportunity and we've seen a bit of growth here over the last month or two. And I think we're notwithstanding the flood of cash from the central banks, see some amount of upside there. And that's what we're working towards. That comes through our NII line and that could be a -- that is factored into some of our forecast but that's the kind of area that we're pushing on. Vivek Juneja : Thanks for that, if I may sneak in one more, Eric, what types of securities are you at and the most recent purchases that you've done? Eric Aboaf : Vivek, I think you mean on the investment portfolio. Vivek Juneja : Yes, investments portfolio, I shifted gears on you. Sorry. Eric Aboaf : I'm okay with the off balance sheet client sponsor program questions or the on balance sheet investment portfolio questions. They're both good ones. On the investment portfolio itself what we've done is we've continued to do a couple of things. I think, first, we've gently expanded our MBS portfolios so we are up 9 billion in securities and up here at the end of this quarter, I'd say, 5 billion to 6 billion of that would be in the MBS space. But we have rotated the types of mortgage backed securities. You'll see eventually the regulatory filings that we expanded a little more in CMOs, in commercial MBS, all government guaranteed because part of what we're doing is trying to put on some cleaner duration paper as opposed to take up premium at risk. And we've also continued to hunt in the specified pools and not just the current coupon. So that's been some of the rotations there. And then we've supplemented that with a little bit of expansion in the international areas around some foreign sovereigns and then some of the triple-A agencies have also been an area of expansion. Vivek Juneja : Greg, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Michael Mayo : Hi, I guess one kind of easy question, one tougher question. But first, so end of period loans were up, is that right, why is that, what seems to be a little different? Eric Aboaf : Mike, end of period loans were up but they were up slightly, we like lending to be up in this environment given that we're there for our clients. We had two offsetting factors, we had number one the continued growth in our client lending capital co-financing in particular continues to be a real important part of our growth to the managers. And that was just offset by some amount of reduction in the overdraft balances on an end of period basis. But the net was up slightly and I think more indicative is total loans were up about 9% or 10% year-over-year. Michael Mayo : Okay, and have you said anything about cutting costs in 2021, how should we think about costs next year? Eric Aboaf : I guess you continue to ask the easy question. So we've not given outright guidance for next year, Mike, we'll do that in January. But we've been clear that we reduce costs this year, 2% last year, adjusted for the acquisition we were down 2%. And we continue to like the approach given the economic environment to drive costs down. And we think that's appropriate. So those are in our plans and what we're working through is what's the magnitude of that next year. Because what we do need to do is continue to drive for gross cost savings. But we also need to reinvest in our business and especially as we add new business and you saw some of the wins this year, we're going to have to implement that. Some of that takes some funding. And then we want to continue to invest and expand into product, features, and so forth of the platform. And that front to back platform in particular, which is going to take some resources. But net-net, we expect costs to continue to be down not only this year, but also next year. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Mike, what I would add to that is we've been very clear that this is not a one and done kind of thing. I mean, sure, there's some tactical things that we -- that if they're there, low hanging fruit, you have to grab at it, you realize that. But we've been -- we're on a sustained program to transform our business. Much of it is around productivity improvement and much of that is driven by the ongoing automating of processes, reduction of manual processes, etcetera. So this is -- I mean, you should expect us to be thinking about this and implementing this on an ongoing basis. Michael Mayo : OK, that's a good segue to my harder question, which is maybe I will phrase it like a Jeopardy question. So the answer, I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, is what you're doing is you're improving efficiency, productivity, automation. You're expanding your revenue streams, as you said at the start Ron and now you're extending the total addressable market with more focus, not just in the top 50 but the next 150. And I guess the question is why and is part of the why because assets under custody were up 11% year-over-year and the servicing fees were only up 2%, in other words, I don't see the revenues keeping up with the business volume and therefore you have to go to these alternative streams and I guess really the question is, what are you seeing on pricing pressure? You said it was easing. You said some business has been coming on at a higher margin, but, we're not seeing it in the final results that are released to us? Thanks. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: And Mike, let me start here, I would add a fourth element to what we're doing, which is also basically expanding our addressable market, meaning that moving from the typical traditional custodian role of being a fund servicer to also being an enterprise outsourcer and to work with the actual management companies or the plan sponsors on their own operating model. And that's just that's an incremental revenue stream that isn't available to us. Why are we doing it, the -- I mean, it's no secret that the traditional fund services business has its series of challenges, not just price compression, although that was done a good job at it. I mean, just think about it. Go back 10, 15 years ago, it was all about new funds being created. Somebody would have a line at domestic funds and they'd like move into other asset classes. They might move into new jurisdictions, new countries. Now, it's -- if anything you're seeing the number of funds go down as distribution platforms are saying, one, we don't want as many funds. And two, we're more interested in estimates anyway. So this is just these trends that are underlying our strategic pivot here. Now, as we've also said, it takes a while for this revenue to be realized and you're kind of seeing that even in the way that we started talking to you about this expanded pipeline at the beginning of 2019 now we're talking to about front to back Alpha wins. And so you should expect to see that some of the things that we talked about in the past in 2019 and early 2020 we will start to be showing up in future quarters as Alpha wins, it is just these things take longer, because going back to what I said earlier, you're actually working with the management company on overhauling the way they work, the way they invest, the way they employ data, the actual tools that they're going to be using, the actual tools they are not going to be using. So I hope that's the why in terms of what we're doing here. Michael Mayo : And then last follow-up, just besides that so going for custodian to an enterprise outsourcer, at what point -- like what percentage of the firm or revenues would the enterprise outsourcing today, where was it a few years ago, where do you hope that to get to, and when do I transfer my coverage to our firms FinTech Analyst, that's enough because that\u2019s the direction I you're going? Michael Mayo : I mean, it's a little early to talk about that and we will talk about our strategy more, some of the upcoming conferences and maybe we'll get into that. We haven't really thought about that. But I think your point I would agree with your points that you should expect to see it be a higher and higher percentage of what we do. And you're also accurate about the technology content in here. And this is very much a technology and a software driven strategy. Michael Mayo : Thank you. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Ron, good morning, Eric. Eric, can you share with us you mentioned about the CET1 ratio, you are badly constrained in it. You said that it's obviously too high at 12.4%, even too high above 11, how low do you think you could comfortably bring that down to and then simultaneously, what's your thoughts about redeeming more preferred stock in 2021 or 2022? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Gerard, it's Eric. Maybe to tackle those in reverse order it's a little early to think through the preferred question because we really want to see what happens with this next round of, kind of intermediate CCAR tasks and just see if there's anything different or not there. So, we're keeping an eye on it. We like the fact that we've already called a couple. Perhaps we certainly be happy to do more if we can. So I think that one is certainly always in mind and we'll give that some more thought. I think on the broader topic of capital ratios we're doing a lot of work here. And maybe just to frame out clearly we have too much capital given the limitations and that's fine. We'll get it back to shareholders as soon as we can. The bridge shows that we need to do is we clearly need to run above the 8% SCB requirement let's assume and we have confidence that that will stay in that -- at that 8% SCB, obviously subject to the Fed indications. But the work we're doing is how much CET1 capital volatility do you have for OCI. And that's where we're kind of working through well, how much can we, should we put in to help the maturity versus available for sale. So we have some ability to influence that and then we have some amount of volatility, to be honest in RWAs right in the risk weighted asset denominator just because you get volatility, you get a little bit of RWA expansion in the FX book. So, it is that it is -- you need volatility cushion of at least 100 to 200 basis points probably. We as bankers want to run conservatively. I think what we're wrestling through is we are in the range of 11% is too high I've said. No, 10% is kind of one of those kind of areas that you want to think really seriously about crossing below, because there is some volatility in our business. And so somewhere in that 10% to 11% range, there's got to be somewhere that we'd like to run. And we're doing a little work to fine tune that. But I think if you do the math that way, you get to a view that there's really a substantial amount of capital to release from based on where we're running, because we're running at 12.5% and 12.5% down to somewhere in the 10% to 11% range is a real return, a sizable return for our shareholders. Gerard Cassidy : Absolutely, that would be very positive. Moving little bit back into investment securities portfolio. Clearly, we're all focused on the rate environment and I think everybody's on one side of the boat, so to speak, in that rate environment is going to stay low for an extended period of time. But it also brings out the interest rate risk for a securities portfolio should rates go up, surprisingly for 2021 or 2022. What indicators do you guys keep an eye on, you can name two or three that really would make you change the way you look at your investment securities situation or where there could be a risk of a mark-to-market situation if they got out of line and rates started to go up, which, nobody's really planning for, the forward curve certainly doesn't call for that at the long end, so I was just curious how do you guys manage and keep an eye on this so that you don't get caught offside should something change unexpectedly 6 to 12 months from now? Eric Aboaf : Gerard I think there are a number of indicators but part of what we do is we manage for the concerning outcomes, the downsides, right. So what we are careful in the portfolio is, you don't want to barbell between one-month paper and 30-year paper because you get a big move in rates. The 30 year hurts. Same thing with three-month paper and 10-year paper. So we're quite careful about where we operate on the curve. And it's not just an average duration that we run at, but we have a series of limits across the curve and we'll position to your point to be quite careful and circumspect. So that's one, there's kind of an outright management process and sort of places that we will operate.  I think in terms of indications, there's clearly a set of Fed indications and then market indications. The Fed's been quite clear about their policy around lifting rates. They've been quite clear about how long, they've been quite clear about inflation targets and kind of general monetary policy planning, and I think that's actually you've got to ascribe a fair amount of reliability to that. And then they're all the market indicators, whether it's the front end of the curve, the steepening, the volatility inherent in some of the curve structure is another indicator that we're very conscious of. And then I've got to say, there's no substitute for doing a running a battery of tests, a battery of stress tests, because you're always worried about what you don't know and what you're not seeing in the marketplaces. And, the good thing about rates markets is we've got 50 years plus of solid history. And we'll do all those tests and then we'll do the theoretical ones. So anyway, it's something we're very careful on, I think is the bottom line. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, appreciate the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl from KBW. Your line is open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Mine is just a real quick question, a clarification question, so Eric, when you were talking about the NII on kind of the go forward past the fourth quarter, I think you said a couple of percentage points down first quarter, second quarter. But did you mean a couple of percentage points down in the first quarter and then another couple of percentage points down in the second quarter and then stabilized from there? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Good, good question Brian. I said a couple of percentage points down, either in the first quarter or second quarter. We think there's a small step down from 4Q to one or the other. It's just really hard because you're always working through what are the headwinds and tailwinds at an inflection point to call the trough. But we think it's sometime in the first half. And we think it's -- we think given what we know today and kind of the market indicators and the assumptions we've shared, we think it's one of those two quarters. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. That was our last question. I will now turn it over to Ron O\u2019Hanley. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Well, thanks to you all on the call for joining us.",

Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to reflect on how State Street successfully adapted to the unique operating environment in 2020, supporting our clients, communities, and the financial system, all while advancing and positioning the business for future success. 2020 was a year like no other in recent memory. As we entered the year, few could have predicted how volatile the operating market -- operating environment would be as the health crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global economic recession, which the world is still dealing with. Against that backdrop, governments, central banks, and financial institutions like State Street needed to act quickly to assist in limiting the impact of this crisis on the financial markets and the global economy. 2020 also highlighted a number of racial and social injustices that we must act to address. When faced with these economic and social challenges, I'm proud of how State Street team members around the world lived our values of being stronger together and a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities, all while generating solid earnings growth for our shareholders in 2020. As the pandemic worsened last year, our global operating capabilities allowed us to adapt quickly and deliver products, services, and results for our clients when they needed us most. In addition to the client-focused product and service enhancements we made in 2020, we continued to transform our operating model by simplifying our operations, increasing automation, and driving productivity and efficiencies while continuing to invest in our business. State Street has been on a journey to transform its operating model for the last two years, and we expect that we'll be able to deliver further improvements during 2021 to drive costs lower, self fund investments for the future, and transform how we compete and operate in the years ahead. At the same time, the volatility in markets demonstrated the strength of our global FX franchise, where we retain the number one market share position with asset managers and achieved an approximately 30% uptick in revenue. We continued our intense efforts to innovate throughout 2020 with the further development and delivery of the State Street Alpha front to back platform, which has gained traction with clients. Through the open architecture nature of the platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships with leading data and analytics providers unlocking new sources of revenue. We signed six Alpha clients in 2020 where early adoption has helped us accelerate our development. The Alpha pipeline remains strong. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our future strategy, we also remained laser focused on improving the financial performance within investment servicing, which is the core engine of our business. We recently enhanced our institutional services client facing strategy, and during 2021 we will leverage improvements in client coverage, segments, and regions to broaden and drive investment servicing revenue growth over time. As a result, our strategic moves, the strength of our capabilities and operating model, and the commitment of our team members enabled successful navigation of 2020 and improved year-over-year financial performance, which I will now discuss further. Turning to Slide 3, fourth quarter EPS was $1.39 or $1.69 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, fourth quarter total revenue declined 4% largely driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, fee revenue increased 2%, reversing recent trends and demonstrating an improved servicing and management fee performance, as well as strong FX trading results. Despite an increase in transaction processing, total expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items. At the end of the fourth quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increased to record levels supported by higher period-end markets. At Global Advisors, we had another strong performance in ETFs and cash. These results in both businesses provide good step-off points for 2021. Turning to our full year 2020 results, we made solid financial progress relative to 2019 as we work to drive fee revenue growth higher and total expenses lower. Full year EPS was $6.32 or $6.70 excluding notable items. EPS results were up 17% and 9% excluding notable items, despite the dramatically lower interest rate environment. Supported by year-over-year improvements in servicing and management fees, very strong FX trading results, and a higher revenue contribution from CRD which continues to perform well, total fee revenue increased 4%. However, total revenue was roughly flat year-over-year as a result of the impact of interest rate headwinds on NII. Our team drove total expenses down 1.5% year-over-year, excluding notable items as we continue to build on the strong culture of expense reduction that we successfully established in 2019. Operating leverage was positive, and margin was up in one of the most challenging years in history. To conclude my opening remarks, State Street faced a number of unprecedented challenges during 2020. As a result of our operational capabilities and innovation, we were able to successfully navigate those challenges all the while acting as a trusted and essential partner to our clients and communities and generating solid year-over-year earnings growth for our shareholders. As we look ahead, for the first quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to $475 million of common stock repurchases, which is in effect the limit set by the Fed. We are well positioned for and looking forward to returning significantly more capital to shareholders in the future. In addition, the Board has also authorized the partial redemption of our Series F preferred stock, which will further benefit our common shareholders following its partial redemption in the first quarter. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail, and then I will return to update you on our medium-term targets. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. Turning to Slide 4, and before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results, let me briefly outline $145 million of notable items we recognized in the fourth quarter, which totaled $0.30 of EPS that will collectively help us deliver another year of declining expenses in 2021. First, we took an employee severance charge of $82 million to eliminate approximately 1,200 positions, mostly in middle management, which will be partially offset by in-sourcing and critical hires during the year. This complements the senior management reductions we made 2 years ago and the ongoing reduction of junior roles through automation that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this to generate savings of approximately $120 million in 2021 and about twice that in the following year. Second, we took a $51 million occupancy charge for real estate to reduce our total office space across 20 sites by about 1 million square feet or approximately 13% of our total square footage. This is the start of our process of reconfiguring our office space for a post-COVID environment. We expect this action to generate savings of roughly $30 million in 2021. We try to minimize repositioning charges, but we have delivered 2 years in a row of underlying expense reduction while investing in our business and want to do so again in 2021. Turning to Slide 5, I will begin my review of both our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, we finished fourth quarter with strong revenues. Total fee revenue increased 2% year-on-year and was up 5% quarter-on-quarter. And while interest rate environment continues to be a headwind, the absence of the $20 million in the third quarter true-up combined with a stronger than expected balance sheet growth led to a 4% quarter-on-quarter improvement in NII. Total expenses ex notables were flat year-on-year, but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter including currency translation and higher variable costs. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2020 performance. And despite the challenging operating environment, dramatically lower interest rates and a suspension by banks, we delivered full year positive operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth rate of 9% excluding notable items. Our GAAP results were even better across the board. Turning to Slide 6, period end AUC/A increased 13% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $38.8 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and better clients flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 11% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter to $3.5 trillion. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows, but offset by continued institutional outflows in the equity index product line. Our SPDR ETF business recorded its second highest quarter of net inflows driven by strong U.S and European flows, taking total net ETF inflows to over $43 billion for the full-year, almost 30% higher than last year. Now on to Slide 7. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 1% year-on-year including currency translation. The increase reflects higher average market levels, softer than expected sales in 2020, as well as lower levels of client activity and normal pricing headwinds. Servicing fees were flat quarter-on-quarter including currency translation has higher average market levels were partially offset by a continued normalization of client activity. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators for our servicing business. AUC/A wins totaled $205 billion, while AUC/A yet to be installed amounted to $436 billion in the fourth quarter. As we look ahead, we are focused on generating the level of gross sales volume needed to offset the typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, which we think is about $1.5 trillion or more of net AUC/A each year. The amount of gross wins needs -- needed to offset these factors will vary year-to-year and be impacted by a number of factors including product mix. This would include Alpha mandates, which were over 25% of our second half AUC/A wins. So as I have mentioned before the sales cycle and inflation of these more complex solution focused services take some time. In 2020, we've had some strong success and growth across our top 50 asset manager clients, as well as within our insurance and asset owner client segments. We have been disappointed, however, with our sales to our mid size asset managers in North America and EMEA and are implementing a plan to address these areas of opportunity. On the bottom right panel, we highlight some of these tactical enhancements to our institutional services strategy, which involves expanding coverage to a total of our top 350 clients and diversifying our pipeline across segments and geographies. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Before I began, you will notice that for the current and prior periods, we have reclassified the AUM base fees that Global Advisors receives for acting as the marketing agent for the SPDR Gold ETF from FX trading services into the management fee line. Going forward, we think this reclass better reflects the management fee performance at Global Advisors. Inclusive of this reclass, fourth quarter management fees reached $493 million, up 3% both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, including the impact of currency translation. Year-on-year, management fees benefited from higher average market rates and the strong ETF inflows I mentioned earlier, partially offset by money market fee waivers of about $3 million, net institutional outflows and the timing of cash outflows. Our fourth quarter investment management pre-tax margin reached 32%, which you can see in our segment reporting in our financial addendum, and we generated significant positive operating leverage. Regarding money market fee waivers, we currently expect they will continue at the current rate of $5 million to $10 million per quarter company-wide in 2021, which is included in our outlook that I will discuss further shortly. FX trading services had another strong quarter. Fourth quarter FX revenue increased 25% year-on-year and was up 20% quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating the strength of our top ranked FX franchise for asset managers. Year-on-year and sequentially, FX revenue benefited from substantially higher indirect FX volumes as well as stronger market making revenue on elevated volatility as we help clients rebalance their global portfolios in the light of ever changing economic and political conditions. The full year 2020 FX revenue surged approximately 30%, will obviously make the 2021 year-on-year comparisons more difficult. Fourth quarter securities finance revenue fell 21% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower enhanced custody balances and agency spreads. Securities finance revenue increased 5% quarter-on-quarter, however, mainly as a result of both higher agency lending assets and higher enhanced custody balances as we saw demand for some leverage reemerge. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 7% year-on-year due to lower on-prem CRD revenue. Software and processing fees increased 19% quarter-on-quarter as a result of sequentially stronger CRD revenue and positive market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, we show CRD revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into its three categories, given the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the ASC 606 revenue recognition accounting standard for on- revenues in particular. Fourth quarter CRD revenue fell 9% year-on-year, largely as a result of the timing of revenue recognition in the fourth quarter of 2019, but was up strongly at 16% quarter-on-quarter on higher renewals. CRD demonstrated very strong revenue growth for the full year, driven in part by the success of the CRD wealth strategy earlier in the year, with total standalone CRD revenues up 14% year-on-year and with the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues growing 18% relative to full year 2019. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the highlights of the State Street Alpha front to back platform sales during 2020. In total, we signed six Alpha clients during the year including three in 4Q, which included one new client and two clients converted from existing relationships. The Alpha pipeline remains promising as clients begin to realize the transformation of potential of the platform for their technology and portfolio management needs. Turning to Slide 10. Fourth quarter NII declined 22% year-on-year, but was up 4% quarter-on-quarter. The quarter-on-quarter increase in NII was driven by the absence of the $20 million true-up in the third quarter. Not including that true-up, the significant investment portfolio balance growth and higher average loans, coupled with a $17 billion of higher average deposits, which were worth about $10 million, and approximately $5 million of episodic FX mark-to-market swap benefits over quarter end were enough to offset the ongoing headwinds of the low interest rate environment on investment portfolio yields. Each quarter, we try to offset the persistent effect of low rates in the portfolio by taking these sorts of tactical actions. In some quarters, we'll be able to fully offset the headwind like we did here, as we put the $17 billion of the deposit surge to work, but that won't be the case every time. On the right side of the slide, we show our end of period and average balance sheet highlights. Last quarter I noted how we expect to operate around $190 billion of average deposits, but that our deposit levels might increase given the Fed's continued expansion of the money supply. As it turns out, we begin -- begun to see the tailwind and now expect to operate at even higher levels of client deposit and more in line with our fourth quarter average or even higher. We will be opportunistic from here regarding the deployment of cash and the expansion of our investment portfolio. But we also need to be mindful of currently tight credit spreads and the potential for OCI risk from interest rate changes. On Slide 11, we\u2019ve again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are readily visible. 4Q '20 expenses were held flat year-on-year, but increased 2% quarter-on-quarter, excluding notable items and including the impact of currency translation, which was worth about a point in the fourth quarter. Relative to the third quarter and ex notables, we achieved a decline in the largest expense segment of comp and benefits, while occupancy and information systems costs were held flat. However, this was more than offset by higher transactional processing and other expenses in the fourth quarter. Transaction processing increased 10% quarter-on-quarter as a result of variable costs tied to higher market data volumes, sub custody balances and brokerage volumes. Other expenses rose 8% quarter-on-quarter as a result of higher marketing and professional fees. For the full year total expenses were down approximately 1.5% ex notables relative to 2019, demonstrating the solid progress we are making in improving our operating model as we continue to reduce expenses, sell fund investments in our business and more than offset natural expense growth. We want to be down again in 2021, which I will detail shortly. Moving to Slide 12. On the left of the slide, we show the growth and evolution of our investment portfolio in 2020 as we supported clients with the MMLF and we've thoughtfully put higher levels of client deposits to work to support NII. On the right of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, as you can see, we continue to navigate this challenging operating environment with extremely strong and elevated capital levels relative to our regulatory requirements. As Ron noted, we are excited that our Board authorized the new common share repurchase program for the first quarter, up to $425 million and which is in line with the new Fed limits. We're also optimizing the capital stack by redeeming $500 million of pref stock, which will have a benefit to our common stockholders starting in 2Q. Turning to Slide 13, you could see a summary of our 4Q '20 and full year 2020 results. I've already covered fourth quarter in detail. So let me say a few words about our full year results, given that we've been on a journey to turn around growth and improve margins and returns. Following a 3% decline in total fee revenues in full year 2019, we successfully drove a 4% increase in total fee revenue growth in full year 2020. Many initiatives came together to successfully make this happen. Following a 6% decline in servicing fees in full year 2019, we intervened to moderate pricing pressure, we revamped our coverage of our top 50 clients and we executed on our Alpha strategy leading to an increase in servicing fees by 2% year-on-year, which made for a real turnaround. At Global Advisors, despite a challenging year on our long-term institutional index product line, our ETF business had a very strong year with total flows up 30% year-on-year and our cash business performing quite well. Our FX trading services business had a remarkable year in 2020, as a result of higher market volatility and record client volumes, and we reap the benefit of our prior investments and our number one position with asset managers. On expenses for the full year, we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive costs out of the business recording a second consecutive year of total net expense reduction, excluding notable items and adjusting for the acquisition of CRD, all the while investing in our products and capabilities. All told, excluding notable items, State Street delivered full year operating leverage of 1.4 percentage points, a 50 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth of 9%, notwithstanding some of the interest rate headwinds. And GAAP results were even stronger across the board. All that said, we have more to do in 2021. So let me get into it. Turning to Slide 14, let me cover our full year 2020 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of 2021. As I usually do, let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain relatively flat, and there is some modest steepening to the yield curve in line with the current forwards and anticipates modestly slowing prepayment speeds. We're also assuming around 7 to 8 percentage point to point growth from equity markets in 2021, as well as normalized market volatility, which impacts our trading businesses. So beginning with revenue, we currently expect that fee revenue will be flat to up 2% for 2021. And fee revenue ex trading will be up 3% to 5%. This includes servicing fees growing towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect fee revenue to be down year-over-year by low single digits perhaps down to the 4%, given headwinds such as the outsized FX trading revenues we saw last year due to volatility in the early days of the pandemic in March. Regarding NII, we expect full year 2021 NII to be down 14% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, as investment portfolio yields continue to grind lower from prepayments and reinvestments. Regarding first quarter of 2021, we expect NII to be down about 68% sequentially, driven by the continued impact of lower rates and day count and should stabilize there and be somewhat range bound, assuming that our rate assumptions do not change significantly. Turning to expenses as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex notables will be flat to down 1% on a nominal basis in 2021 due to our continued focus on resource and infrastructure optimization, and currently assume that currency translation will be a 1% headwind in this estimate. This net expense reduction includes approximately 4% to 5% of variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like CRD, Alpha and tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2021, we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide year-over-year and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter. We also expect releases of provisions for credit losses during 2021 of at least a third of what was built in 2020. Taxes should be in the 17% to 19% range for 2021. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Turning to slide 15. I would like to update you on the current thinking on our medium term targets, which we now aim to achieve by the end of 2023 on a run rate basis for 2024. At this time, we still consider these target levels to be the right ones for our business and our shareholders. As a result, they remained unchanged as you can see from the slide. However, we now expect these targets may take longer to achieve than we had initially anticipated, largely as a result of exogenous factors. We set these medium term targets in early December 2018. Soon thereafter, interest rates fell as the Fed tried to stimulate a slowing economy in 2019 and then again as COVID hit in 2020. The market went from expecting in 2018, the Fed to approach 3% by late 2019, to ending 2020 at 25 basis points with no rate heights expect -- with no rate hikes expected until at least 2023. Meanwhile, long end rates also fell from about the 2.9% level at the time we gave the targets to just -- to average just 90 basis points during 2020. All told, we estimate that the sharply lower rate environments since 4Q '18 has impacted our 4Q '20 pre-tax margin by about 5 percentage points in ROE by around 2.5 percentage points. We also witnessed a large downdraft in global equity markets in late 2018, followed by a steady rebound in the U.S equity markets, but international equity market averages over the last 2 years were down. While we are clearly operating in a dramatically different environment relative to when we set our targets, we have made real progress. We went from a 3% decline in fee revenue in 2019 to a 4% growth in fee revenue by reversing the trajectory of our servicing fees and delivering in our global markets business. We are evolving our business model to become an enterprise outsource provider while at the same time enhancing our investment service and capabilities and client coverage distinguishing us from our competitors. We've also systematically reduced net expenses ex notable items, which has helped -- help us begin to close the margin gap to our peers by about 2 percentage points. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ongoing strong expense results. In summary, though interest rates have impacted the timing of our medium term targets, I'm confident in the direction of our business and we will continue to innovate to meet our clients' needs and drive business growth, while also focusing on improving productivity to achieve our goals. And with that operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alexander Blostein : Great, thank you. Good morning, everybody. So first, Eric, for you, maybe just to clarify some of the comments you made around servicing fees. So you talked about $1.5 trillion in sort of annual client attrition. Is that a -- that's about 4%, I think of your AUC. Is that sort of what we should be thinking about as kind of like a gross impact on revenues as well? And qualitatively, how does that compare to prior periods? Has anything changed that sort of drives this churn higher? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric. Thanks for the question. We're trying to be real clear about our sales expectations for our business, because at the end of the day that is part of what we do every day and we do it across segments, across regions, across client groups. And I think to kind of give you some perspective on that, we wanted to be clear that to actually have to demonstrate net new business, right, so to be able to offset the nominal amount of attrition that we always get, which is a few percentage points and actually overcome that plus deliver some amount of net new business growth, we need about $1.5 trillion of gross new sales a year to accomplish that, and we think that's what would really contribute to the rebound of growth that we'd like to see. Now, in truth, we've not gotten there this year. This year, net new business was flat, and you saw our AUC/A wins at about $800 billion. And so, it's just obviously an area of pretty intense focus, but I think it's the kind of area that we feel like we can make a dent on. If you step back, we've made really good progress on our top 50 clients where our -- where we rolled out our coverage process and set of executives about 2 years ago, and we've seen the growth there. We've seen it in a couple of segments, and now we need to broaden that and deepen that kind of coverage intensity across the rest of franchise. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Alex, I'd like to just add to that. I would not want to leave you with the impression that there's a client retention problem here, if anything, client retention has gone up. But if you think about things like what the market is facing in terms of reduction in funds, for example, or if you think about M&A, oftentimes represents an opportunity for us. So, there's a small amount of attrition broadly defined as much asset attrition as it is client attrition. And what we're trying to be here is very clear on how we think about our -- what we need to do from a sales perspective and what we're doing about it. Alexander Blostein : Great. Thank you. That clears it up a bit. Speaking of M&A, Ron, I wanted to ask you a question around SSGA. Obviously, there's been several headlines around potential strategic actions State Street could make around its asset management business. And in the past, you also talked about the drive for scale in that business, just like what you're trying to provide to your clients. So maybe you can update us on your latest kind of strategic thinking for SSGA when it comes to either acquisitions or divestitures, obviously there was a JV headline out there as well. And as you think about sort of these various avenues, what is the ultimate kind of financial and strategic goal you're trying to achieve for State Street as a whole when it comes to SSGA? Thank you. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Alex, I'm not going to comment on market rumors, but what I'm going to say is what I've said before. We have a very strong franchise in SSGA. It's particularly strong in the ETF space, the cash space, the indexing space. It\u2019s got an increasingly strong position in ESG. Having said that, as we've said before, we see the world evolving. And therefore we need to think about how to add capabilities, both product and distribution capabilities, or distribution access to this. So we are -- it's not new. Any time you ask us about this, I think I answered it more or less the same way that we're constantly thinking about this. We've made some steps over the past several years in terms of organically adding really important product capability, for example, fixed income ETFs, ESG capabilities, we launched the low-cost range of funds, we created the distribution arrangement to help propel those low-cost funds. So, we will continue to look at those things, and we'll continue to look at inorganic activities, if we think it's the best outcome. And to answer the last part of your question, what we're looking to do is to best position SSGA for growth. It\u2019s a to remarkable asset. It's got a lot of potential, and we'll do what we need to do to best position it for growth. Alexander Blostein : Yes, for sure. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Eric, just a follow-on on the NII side. Just wondering if you could help us understand you talked about some type of step off from fourth to first in terms of NII and then stabilization. And I'm just wondering if you can walk us through the pieces of what are still moving through other than day count in the first quarter. And how much premium AUM was in the quarter, and is that part of a rate of change that you can see any type of -- help that stabilization or benefit thereafter? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Ken. It's Eric. Sure. Let me describe first maybe third quarter to the fourth quarter to give you some context, and then fourth quarter to first quarter and then kind of see what we see from there. Going into the fourth quarter, we have the usual headwinds from investment -- from the investment portfolio and actually higher premium amortization than we've had previously, and that would cost us sequentially about $35 million. That's kind of the headwind. Now, that will come back to, because that headwind is attenuating each quarter, but that was a headwind. Against that headwind in the fourth quarter, we had some unusual benefits. We had the FX swap mark-to-market, which was about $5. We had a surge in deposits, both in developed markets and in emerging markets. Remember, they're valuable in emerging markets worth about $10 as a tailwind. And then we built our investment portfolio and added quite a bit of loans at the tune of about $20 million. Now, that was a larger bill than usual, but a better remunerated plan. And so, those are the kind of features that held us flat in effect from 3Q to 4Q. I think if we go into first quarter, you kind of take each of those in pieces, the investment portfolio, headwind, it's probably going to be about $25 million instead of $35 million. So you see it attenuate. And part of that is that the prepayment speeds are neutral we think from 4Q to 1Q. We have some tailwinds of deposits and loans and investments, but that's probably worth about 10 bucks. And then we still have a couple headwinds, we have the unwind of the swap mark-to-market which sequentially is worth 10, because you got to double up the positive turns negative. And then you have day count worth another 10 as a headwind. So that's kind of what gets us to the guide that we gave. Once we get through the first quarter, I think what we expect to see is that stabilization and what we're effectively expecting is that the investment portfolio headwind which was $35 million, but coming $25 million, it's going to start to trend down to $10 million a quarter. And why is that partly rates have been kind of working through the on the yield side and partly because prepayment speeds we expect to start to attenuate as we see higher rates. And so, we do expect some lesser headwinds. And against that, we think that the actions that we take on a more traditional basis will be worth about plus 10. And so it will be roughly neutral and stable from 1Q to 2Q and 2Q to 3Q and so forth. Obviously, it'll be range bound. And obviously, it'll be -- there's always a little bit of lumpiness that we get into, but that's our best estimate of what we're seeing today, based on the curves, the expectations of rates and so forth. Kenneth Usdin : So Eric, sorry, if I can speak that back at you is that mean kind of a 50 something million dollar decline for the first, if I got all your add up there? 10, 25 and 10 and 10, and 10? Just trying to understand what that all gets to? Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think I said 6% to 8%. So I think we're looking at \u2026 Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Eric Aboaf : \u2026 whatever $35 million decline in the first quarter and then stable from there. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, sorry. Got it. Understood. All right. Great. Thank you. And then just one follow-up on a big picture, unfortunate another news item to ask you about. Yes, we're going on. Now, I guess 9 months since the BlackRock ETF headline news was out there as well and I know it's a specific client, but if there's a way of just helping us understand just what needs to happen for that to either be codified as you're keeping it or going away. Just any commentary would be helpful. Thank you. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, that process is still underway. We're working very closely with them. They have not made any decisions at this, but we are feeling reasonably positive about them. Eric Aboaf : And Ken, it's Eric. I also just remind you though, that is a growing -- it's a growing business, a growing asset at quite a high pace, right. And so I think the last time we had one of these, it took 3 years from start to finish to kind of work out from discussion to RFP to response and so forth. And so I think there's [indiscernible] factor that into the -- to any scenarios that you run. Kenneth Usdin : Yes. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Adam Beatty : Thank you and good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just wanted to focus in a little bit on some of the softness you mentioned in the U.S and EMEA mid market phase. I\u2019m wondering if you could help us maybe size that a little bit, recognizing your efforts to broaden and diversify the business, just in terms of the core of what you've got right now. Either maybe size it or talk about the impact that had on your '21 guide. And also interested in any interaction with the activities of the pricing committee there in terms of either structuring pricing, or what have you in order to better retain or win business. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Adam. It's Eric. Let me start. I think the way we think about our business on the servicing side is across segments, right. We have asset managers, we have asset owners, we have insurers, and our business is more geared to asset managers in the other segments. And so, we've historically built our franchise there, but we've actually done quite a bit of success in other -- in those other segments as well. Within asset managers, what we're starting to find is over the last year, last 2 years, the last year, in particular, we've actually secured more growth than the largest of the asset managers. They're obviously winning when you look at the external data, and either less growth or in some places decline in the mid size and smaller asset managers. And so what -- and that gap can be -- that gap in a particular quarter or a year could be a 2 percentage point growth gap, it could be a 3 or 4 percentage point growth gap, it bounces around. And so what we're finding is that, we really feel like we have the right coverage and intensity and kind of seniority focused on the largest of our clients. But our midsize clients are really an important part of our franchise. We built our franchise on them, we provide really, I think outstanding products and capabilities. And we're finding we need to spend both senior time on the midsize clients as well as the time of our relationship managers and client executives. And so this is really about intensifying our coverage of those groups, and helping them see the strength and the opportunities and the products and services that we can offer. And make sure we're top of mind that we're building on share of wallet. I've got share of wallet statistics for top 250 clients, and that includes the midsized players and really executing in that area day in, day out product one, product two, product 30, product 50, it's literally down at that level of granularity where we're focused now. Adam Beatty : Excellent. That's helpful in the dynamics. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on MBS prepays. I appreciate the detail from before on that. Recognizing, of course, that interest rates will be the main driver there. Do you feel as though this past year 2020 there was any type of pull forward, in prepayments or refinancing, such that a reversal and downward ticking rates might not generate the same level of prepays as previously? Or is it very much still linked to rates? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Adam, it's Eric. I always like to hope that prepayments are burning through that there's been a one-time pop and then they're going to attenuate, but I've learned that hoping isn't a strategy, right. We just have to operate through the environment. I think what we've seen is certainly a surge of prepayments, starting in the end of 2Q, right, once people figured out how to do the paperwork during COVID in 3Q and 4Q. And our best estimate is informed by the various modeling providers. We subscribe to 3 or 4 of them, because we knew that diversity of opinion suggests that prepayment speeds should probably continue into the first quarter, and then I'll begin to edge down from there in the second quarter and the third quarter, with some stepwise improvement. That said, we've got -- I think we've got to live through time here and just see how it plays out and we'll know more. What we're trying to do, though, is make sure that we're always taking the actions that we can on investment portfolio, on deposit reinvestment, on loans, because that's something we can control and we need to stay focused on those actions. Adam Beatty : Fair enough. Thank you, Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ryan Kenny : Hi. This is Ryan Kenny on behalf of Betsy. Good morning. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Good morning. Ryan Kenny : So we saw the OCC stablecoin approval come through earlier this month. Just wondering if that has any impact on State Street, and how you're thinking about your blockchain strategy going forward? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Hi. This is Ron. In terms of direct impact, first, the OCC doesn't regulate us. And secondly, it directly impacts or, if you will, poses the most challenge to the payments banks. For us, in general, it's probably neutral to positive because anything that stimulates more interest in blockchain and particularly more interested in digital currency is going to create a custody opportunity for us. And we have been investing fairly significantly in that space, as we've said in the past of blockchain itself is actually quite an important part of lots of things that we're doing in custody and asset servicing, and increasingly, we see digital coins, did cryptocurrency as part of holdings within our client base and we'll continue to invest in that. But the OCC's work itself, I would say, not directly relevant to us at this time. Ryan Kenny : Thanks. And then one quick other question. Wondering how we should think about the impact from money market fee waivers in 2021? Is it in the run rate now? Or should we expect any upset from here? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Ryan, its Eric. Good part of it is in the runway run rate I think we said about $3 million in 4Q. We do expect it to tick up one more step and we fix, we're now expecting about $5 million to $10 million a quarter in the coming years. So I think we're much less exposed than others. We don't have retail money market funds. We don't have high net worth funds with higher fees. So -- but those are the figures. Ryan Kenny : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Brian Bedell : Great. Good morning, folks. Eric, maybe just to continue along the net interest income guide for '21. Just if you can just talk about your earning asset assumptions for the year and deposit growth strategy realized and obviously, they spiked up in 4Q. But as you -- you're building your servicing business and you're trying to enhance some of the deposit strategies. Maybe if you can talk about that and your assumptions for '21? And then in fact, also on the premium amortization, I think the $35 million from 3Q to 4Q, is that about a $170 million leverage? I just want to [indiscernible]. Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. Let me do those in reverse order. I think the -- what the $35 million was the headwind we're seeing on a quarterly basis from 4Q to -- from 3Q to 4Q in the investment portfolio. That was a combination of the investment yield grind down and actually higher premium amortization because we're still living through that wave. What I then said is that 4Q to 1Q, we thought the combination of the investment portfolio headwind including premium amortization would be about a $25 million headwind. And then I said starting in second quarter, we thought it would trend down even further to closer to $10 million -- $15 million and $10 million in those out quarters each quarter. So I think what we're starting to see is an attenuation or have that expectation, which partly is the kind of tractor of the investment portfolio playing through and partly lower levels of premium amortization expected as speeds begin to edge downwards. In terms of the deposit forecast and the earning asset strategy, deposits, it's really hard to gauge. The Fed continues to expand the money supply by what about $120 billion a month, we are at 1% or 2% of the deposits. So we pick up deposits just by being here every month. So there's some amount of tailwind. It's just really hard to read, given lots of talk about stimulus bills, asset allocation and reallocation from risk to -- risk on risk off to bar belling. So I think, right now, we're assuming that we're going to at least stay at these fourth quarter level of average deposits, with probably a little bit of edging up. And so we're not yet -- we're not at this point of expecting yet another surge, but you just don't know, and I think we'll obviously respond, and that happens. In terms of asset strategy, that's a tough one. I think it's tough for us and for every other bank, because we can certainly take some risks on the curve, but you don't get paid very much for it. And so, I think there's a balance that we're making, which is how much dry powder you want to keep. And so then when you do see a spike of interest rates, you can add your leg into that at a higher and better return versus forsaking some income in the short-term. And we\u2019re -- our investors are always kind of carefully picky about that, trying to be opportunistic and will come and go. And we'll do that in treasuries around the curve. MBS you've seen us build up. Our MBS book over the last year by a solid $10 billion. I think we want to just be careful there. We want to -- we prefer some of the prepayment protected sub-segments. We've done a little bit of credit. We want to be careful there too, because credit isn't -- is impacted during the CCAR and SCB process. So it's a pretty diversified approach. I think it's the core of our strategy, looking for opportunities. And I think as we see some of those will act, and we'll certainly report on them to all of you. Brian Bedell : Okay. That's great color. Thank you. And then on the -- just back to the $1.5 trillion that you mentioned of growth service, you went to offset some of the headwinds. Can you just talk about the cross-sell portion of that. So this would be adding different new services to existing clients. Maybe how that sort of tracking within that outlook, and then also the importance of SSGA's indexing business as a cross-sell to asset servicing clients. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Brian, it's Ron. Cross-sell is a very big piece of this. I mean, if you think about what Eric said earlier, look at 2020 performance, it was largely the same in 2019. The fastest growing segment, or the segments that accounted for the most growth was in fact our global client division, which is our largest client. So by definition, we weren't adding many to that, if any, but what we were doing was growing substantially in there. And that will be a key part of our growth going forward, for both traditional asset servicing products, as some of these providers continue to consolidate -- some of these institutions continue to consolidate providers, but also for front to back Alpha activities as we install either fully install Alpha or even put Charles River in a situation where we have the middle in the back office, but not the front. So that's a key part of it. As we think about the numbers, certainly the ability to have common clients where we're both the asset servicer and the indexer is attractive, we always look for those opportunities. That that's not in the assumption that Eric's describing there. So what we really were trying to do here, in response to many questions we've gotten is more or less dimension, what we need to do to grow revenue, it's obviously that number. It's based on averages. So to the extent to which, in a given year or given quarter, we're bringing in higher fee kinds of assets, then obviously, the 9.5 goes down. So that's the way to think about it. You can never at the end of any particular quarter say, well, if you're not a quarter of the way there you -- are you making it or not, you got to go one click down and say what was the nature of the kind of underlying business which you'll be able to understand from us. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Robert Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Hi, Rob. Robert Wildhack : You called out some reduced client activity is pressuring servicing fees in the fourth quarter. Just wondering how that played out with respect to expectations. And then more qualitatively, the level of client activity, you're thinking about? Is it the outlook for next year or this year, 2021? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Rob. It's Eric. There are a number of features in how we quantify the growth kind of headwinds, tailwinds of our servicing business. Client activity is one of those that fluctuates and really represents some of the trading volumes of our clients, because there's some tolling that we do for that, in particular, cash and derivative trades tend to have more likely have tolls than others just because they're a little more complicated, ETF creation, redeem that kind of stuff. So it's a part of our fee schedules that we try to quantify, but it has a long list of kind of volumetric elements. I think on a year-on-year basis, 4Q '20 versus a year ago, the -- that -- those some of the client activity volumes actually trended down. So servicing fees, it was worth about a percentage point of servicing fee headwinds. That's an example of a time it hits against us. For full year 2020, it was actually a positive of almost 2 percentage points. So we saw that as a tailwind. And obviously, the -- all the activity in first quarter, second quarter, in particular, was helpful. Next year, we're going to have to lap ourselves on that. So it'll probably be a 1%. headwind. So it's got that kind of effect. And what it does is it reminds us that everything matters in our business to drive growth, right. If there's an equity market, tailwind or headwind that matters. This client activity matters, as well net new business, right, and [indiscernible] I referenced kind of the importance of gross new sales matters, and then there's always the normalized fee headwinds. And the good news on that last one is that those have normalized back to something pretty close to historical levels. Robert Wildhack : Okay, thanks. And I wanted to also ask about the business that you're forming with Microsoft, IHS, PIMCO and others. Can you give us some more detail on the structure there? What products and services you'll be contributing and how the potential offering there will compare to your standalone offering today? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Rob, it's early days you're referring to hub. And it's early days there in terms of what's going to happen. And our view was that given the role that we play as a custodian as well as our own Alpha product, that this was a good initiative to hang around, if you will. We also have clients that are part of it, but it's just very early days in terms of how that's going to develop its initial focus is on data and data usage and helping firms kind of managing employee data in a more efficient way. But, again, it's so early on, there's really not much to report. Robert Wildhack : Okay. No problem. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Eric Aboaf for closing remarks. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: It's Ron. I'll take it. Thank you everybody for your time and attention and we look forward to following up with you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the environment we\u2019re operating in today as compared to this time last year and then highlight some of the data that evidence the progress we are making towards enhancing and improving our operating model and innovating across our franchise all the while being an essential partner for our clients. Relative to the first quarter of 2020, the first three months of 2021 could hardly be more different. Economic activity is sharply rebounding, unemployment is declining and equity markets have recovered strongly from the crisis levels experienced in 2020. Although, short end rates remain at historically low levels, long end US bond yields are rebounding. While COVID-19 infection and death rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world, there is clearly light at the end of this pandemic tunnel. The owners and managers of the world\u2019s capital are also looking to the future into the next stage of growth. As the economy and financial markets continue to recover and investment inflows continue to grow, we remain focused on delivering for our clients across segments and regions. As demonstrated by our first quarter financial results, State Street continued to successfully navigate the improving operating environment. Although, as I noted, short term interest rates, which compressed further during the first quarter, remain a critical headwind for our industry. While we cannot control interest rates, we are resolutely focused on implementing our strategy and pivoting our business to being more of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider, underpinned by the ongoing development and delivery of our State Street Alpha front to back platform. And we look forward with confidence for a number of reasons. First, we further built upon our reputation for reliability during the crisis and our clients know they can depend on us to deliver the services and market solutions they need in good times and in bad. Second, throughout the crisis, we continue to invest in further strengthening and distinguishing our global operating model, client service and operational resiliency, which has been apparent to and noted by our clients. Third, many clients are reassessing their own operating models. And as a result, we have the opportunity to take on more of their operations and data activities, allowing them to focus on creating better investment outcomes for their clients. Fourth, our employees continue to perform at very high levels despite a year of largely remote work and disrupted routines. I am grateful for their extraordinary dedication and service. Last, both our Alpha and non-Alpha institutional servicing value propositions continue to resonate and enjoy take up as demonstrated by some recent announcements. For example, we reported an additional three State Street Alpha clients during the first quarter and separately this morning, we announced the full front to back Alpha relationship with Invesco, adding front and middle office services to our existing back office mandates. Through the open architecture nature of our operating platform, we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships, unlocking new sources of revenue and strengthening the interoperability element of our Alpha value proposition, which is appealing to clients. After quarter end, we announced that M&G has appointed us to provide outsource middle office services in addition to our existing fund accounting company services. State Street will administer the middle office services on Aladdin, exemplifying how we offer clients the benefit of choice regarding their front end and middle office systems. These deals highlight how we are uniquely positioned to win front to back mandates as well as to win new business as a result of interoperable nature of our operating platform. While the Alpha platform remains an integral part of our strategy, we also continue to innovate across our franchise. For example, a growing demand exists for ESG solutions that will provide the necessary data, risk analytics and reporting capabilities at scale. To that end, during the first quarter we introduced enhancements to our ESG solutions that can now provide clients with the ability to address new global ESG regulatory requirements for a single platform. Global Advisors\u2019 new US corporate ESG ETF launched in EMEA in late 2020 and grew to $5.4 billion of AUM by the end of the first quarter, making it the largest corporate bond ESG funds in the use of space. We also continue to develop our digital asset strategy as we prepare to deploy our capabilities and servicing [Technical Difficulty]. We recently announced our intention to serve as the VanEck Bitcoin Trust ETF. Subject to regulatory approval, we will work with VanEck to provide services, including ETF basket operations, custody of the ETF shares on the counting order taking and transfer agency in multiple jurisdictions. Next, I will review our first quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Turning to Slide 3. First quarter EPS was $1.37 or $1.47 excluding notable items. Relative to the year ago period, first quarter total revenue declined 4%, driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our NII results. However, total fee revenue increased 4%, driven by servicing and management fee growth, which increased 7% and 6% year-over-year respectively, as well as an improved software and processing fee performance. Collectively, these more than offset the year-over-year headwind from FX trading as compared to the exceptionally strong first quarter of trading last year. While our FX trading revenues are down year-over-year, first quarter revenue remains well above pandemic levels as a result of higher client volumes and the investment we have made in our platforms and talent in recent [Technical Difficulty]. Even with rising total fee revenue, first quarter total expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation as productivity improvements are paying off. Furthermore, we have successfully reduced high cost location headcount relative to the period one year ago. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to control core operating expenses over the remainder of 2021. At the end of the first quarter, AUC/A and AUM both increase to record levels supported by higher period end markets. AUC/A increased to $40.3 trillion, new asset servicing wins were a solid $343 billion, while servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Global Advisors\u2019 AUM increased to $3.6 trillion and also benefited from a very strong flow performance in ETFs and a solid performance in the cash business. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 14% to $225 million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing while also enabling our Alpha strategy. Overall, we had a strong start to the year and remain confident that we have a clear path to our medium term targets discussed in January. To conclude, we continued to successfully navigate and distinguish ourselves in a fluid [Technical Difficulty] moving operating environment as demonstrated by our first quarter results. We remain focused on further developing and growing our Alpha [offline] and are pleased with the recent client activity. Meanwhile, we also continue to innovate across and grow many areas of our franchise. During the first quarter, we returned $659 million of capital to our shareholders through a combination of common share repurchases and common dividends. For the second quarter of 2021, our Board has authorized up to 425 million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the FED.  And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin my review of our first quarter results on slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.37 or $1.47 excluding the impact from notable items, which amounted to $0.10 in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on the right side of the slide. On the left to the slide, you can see that we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth while expenses were well controlled despite higher market values and client volumes. As a result of the depreciating dollar relative to the year ago period, we also show our first quarter results excluding the impact of currency translation in the column to the right. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-over-year or up 2% excluding the impact of currency translation despite the significantly year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services results we had in the first quarter of last year due to the pandemic. For context, total fee revenue excluding FX trading services was up 9% year-on-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with strong mid single digit growth in servicing fees, management fees and securities finance. Expenses were roughly flat year-on-year excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. So in total this was a solid quarter, demonstrating the progress we\u2019re making, improving our operating model as we drive towards growth. Turning to Slide 5, you\u2019ll see strong business volume growth across the franchise. Period end AUC/A increased 26% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to a record $40 trillion. The year-on-year change was driven by higher period end market levels, client flows and net new business growth. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increase the result of higher period end equity market levels, better client flows and net new business, which more than offset the impact of lower bond markets. We\u2019re seeing that both retail and institutional investors have moved off the sidelines and we\u2019re seeing inflows globally across most product types that we now custody. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 34% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter to $3.6 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net ETF and cash inflows. Our ETF franchise had a strong flow performance again as the US ETF industry experience record flows. Spider net inflows amounted to over $23 billion in the first quarter with both sectors and industries and low costs doing particularly well. Turning to Slide 6. First quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels and normal pricing headwind. Servicing fees were also up 5% quarter-on-quarter as a result of the higher average market levels and stronger client activity. This quarter, we saw good growth in asset managers, alternatives and official institutions. I\u2019m pleased with how 2021 has started as the first quarter AUC/A wins totaled a solid $343 billion, which is up from recent quarters. And for context, last quarter you heard me outline that we need approximately $1.5 billion of annual gross sales volumes in order to drive net underlying growth, which means offsetting typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds in our servicing business. I\u2019m also pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of client segments and deal sizes with an attractive overall fee rate as we continue to work on generating broad based growth across our clients, segments and regions. As an example, you may have also seen that earlier in the quarter we announced that we have assumed that depository bank and fund administrative activities of a subsidiary of Intesa Sanpaolo in Europe. AUC/A 1 but yet to be installed amounted to $463 billion at quarter end. Positively, both are reported wins and to be installed numbers exclude the two recently announced mandates, which Ron mentioned just a moment ago, as these deals were signed after the end of the first quarter. Turning to Slide 7, let me discuss several other [important] fee revenue lines in more detail. First quarter management fees were $493 million, up 6% year-on-year, including 2% impact from currency translation but were flat quarter-on-quarter. Both our year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance has benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong flow performance within our ETF and cash businesses, partially offset by an idiosyncratic client asset reallocation from higher fee products as well as money market fee waivers. Regarding money market fee waivers, we had about $15 million this quarter and we expect that they will increase given the significant downward move in short end rates in March. If they persist, we expect company wide impact could be around $50 million to $55 million per quarter for the rest of the year beginning in 2Q and of distribution fee, though higher balances should be worth roughly $10 million to $15 million per quarter, leaving the net impact closer to $40 million per quarter. FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the exceptional first quarter of 2020, FX trading revenue fell 22% year-on-year but it was up 7% quarter-on-quarter with higher volumes across both developed and emerging market currency pairs. While FX market volatility declined relative to the fourth quarter, we continue to see higher client volumes as our FX business continued to benefit from many years of investment across six venues and now 47 markets, three of which we added and two of which we expanded in the last year alone. Our securities finance business recorded its second consecutive quarter of good revenue growth, increasing 8% year-on-year and 13% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of [higher] enhanced custody balances driven by new mandates from alternative clients and increase in fixed income assets on loan within our agency lending program. Finally, our first quarter software and processing fees were up 55% year-on-year and down 15% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to changes in mark-to-market adjustments. Moving to Slide 8, we have here CRD standalone revenue growth and business performance metrics. We have again separated CRD revenues into three categories to help to see through the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the revenue recognition accounting rules for on premise revenue. Total CRD revenues increased 4% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher software enabled revenue and was 10% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely due to seasonally higher on premise revenues in the fourth quarter. As shown on the Slide, the more durable SaaS and professional services revenues increased by a strong 21% combined growth rate relative to the year ago period. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the first quarter highlights of State Street Alpha. We reported an additional three Alpha clients during the first quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate with our client base, and this doesn\u2019t include this morning\u2019s first quarter and quarter end announcement. The Alpha pipeline continues to remain promising as the economic disruption in the last year has helped clients realize the transformational potential of the Alpha platform for their technology and operations infrastructure. Turning to Slide 9. First quarter NII declined 30% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of the low interest rate environment on our investment portfolio and the absence of $20 million market related benefits in the first quarter of 2020. Quarter-on-quarter, NII declined 6% as expected. Around 3% of the sequential quarter decline was due to the impact of lower long end rates on our investment portfolio despite a sequential improvement in premium amortization. Approximately 1 percentage point of the sequential decline was due to just a half quarter\u2019s downdraft in short end rates on our sponsored member repo activity, and the rest was due to the lumpier items, including day count. These impacts were partially offset by higher deposit balances as you can see on the right of the slide. Total average deposits increased by $20 billion in the first quarter or an increase of 10% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s expansionary monetary policy. We remain mindful of OCI risk to our capital. So as the US Treasury sold off dramatically during the first quarter, we gently trimmed the investment portfolio and may selectively reinvest a bit over the coming months at higher rates. Turning to Slide 10, we\u2019ve again provided a view of the expense base this quarter ex notables, so that the underlying trends are clearly evident. Excluding notable items, first quarter expenses increased 2% year-on-year which is all driven by the weaker dollar, which means we effectively held underlying expenses flat year-on-year. On a line item basis, compensation employee benefits was up only 1% excluding the impact of currency translation as higher seasonal expenses were partially offset by reduction in headcount in higher cost locations. Information systems and communication expenses were up 3% excluding the impact of currency translation due to higher software costs and continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing expenses were up just 1% ex FX as our savings initiatives offset significant volume based growth in subcustody and market data costs. Occupancy and other expenses were both down several points. Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal and deferred compensation. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the underlying expense performance in the first quarter as we absorbed approximately $15 million of variable revenue related costs. We continue to demonstrate operating model improvements as we drive increased productivity through automation, reengineering and scale. Moving to Slide 11, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the improving operating environment with strong capital levels. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year but fell 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 10.8%. Relative to the fourth quarter, our capital base was impacted by lower AOCI as a result of the significant run up in long end US treasury yields as well as by an increase in intangibles related to the recently announced lift up deal we completed with Intesa Sanpaolo. We also saw $6 billion increase in episodic RWA, primarily related to FX trading and overdraft activity. This RWA headwind was transient in nature and has already declined by $5 billion. So at the end of the second quarter, our CET1 ratio will be over 11%, all else being equal. Tier 1 leverage was down year-over-year and fell by 1 percentage point quarter-on-quarter to 5.4%, primarily as a result of higher average assets, driven by the increase in quarterly average deposit balances as well as the AOCI change and the $500 million partial call for Series F preferred securities announced in January. As you can see on the slide and as I mentioned previously, we continue to consider a CET1 target range of 10% to 11% as appropriate level of capital for our business. Further, we consider that a Tier 1 leverage ratio between 5.25% and 5.75% as also being appropriate for our business model and can comfortably operate in this quarter this year even with the recent growth in deposits. Last, as we look ahead and as Ron noted, for the second quarter of 2020, our Board has authorized up to $425 million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the Fed. Turning to Slide 12, we provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued headwind from historically low interest rates, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our business as well as the progress we are making within our institutional services franchise. Total fee revenue was up almost 4% year-on-year, including the significant year-on-year headwind from the exceptional FX trading services result we had in the first quarter of last year. And excluding FX trading services, total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year or 7% excluding the impact of currency translation with solid mid single digit growth across servicing fees, management fees and sec lending. And with that strong top line fee growth, expenses were well controlled and were held roughly flat year-over-year excluding notable items and the headwind from foreign currency translation, demonstrating the progress we\u2019re making in improving our operating model. Next, I would like to update our full year economic outlook and provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our full year interest rate outlook assumes that short end rates remain pressured and there is some modest steeping of the yield curve, in line with the current forwards, which suggests modestly improving premium amortization so the pace of improvement remains uncertain. We\u2019re also now assuming global equity markets will be flattish to the current levels for the rest of the year or up around 10% point-to-point from the beginning of 2021 as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. In terms of the second quarter of 2021, our guide includes about 2 percentage points of currency tailwinds for fee revenue and 2 percentage points of headwinds for expenses. So we expect that overall fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year depending on equity market levels with servicing and management fees up 7% to 8% as we anniversary a strong 2Q 2020 in FX trading and CRD. Regarding NII, given the impact of historically low short end rates as well as the impact of long end rates in our investment portfolio, we now expect NII to run around $460 million to $465 million per quarter from here in 2021, assuming premium amortization continues to attenuate. Turning to expenses. We remain laser focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses ex notable items will be up around 2.5% year-over-year or relatively flat ex currency translation with some potential for variability due to the revenue related costs. On taxes, we expect that the 2Q \u201821 tax rate will be towards the upper end of our full year range of 17% to 19%. While it is still early in the year, we are taking up our full year fee revenue guide again and now expect full year fee revenue to be up 2.5% to 4%. We also expect that slightly higher revenue related variable costs will add about 50 basis points to our prior full year expense guide of flat to down 1% ex notable items. Just remember, there\u2019s a solid point of FX translation in these full year fees and full year expense guides. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Eric. And operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : So maybe we could start with servicing fees. I was hoping, first, we could unpack sort of Q1 dynamics a bit more. So ex currency translation, servicing fees were up about 4% sequentially. Maybe you can just kind of walk us through how much was the market and higher volumes versus more kind of organic trends in the quarter? And then taking a step back, it really sounds like momentum in front to back is progressing pretty nicely. So I was hoping you could bridge these data points you highlighted on the call, sort of back to the servicing fee algorithm that, Eric, you talked about in the past kind of between markets pricing, new business. I think collectively, that added up to like maybe a low single digit growth over time. Kind of how does that feel to you guys now given some of the changes you\u2019ve seen in the business? Eric Aboaf : Let me start on the quarter and then we\u2019ll talk a little more about the momentum in the business. I think we felt like we had a solid quarter here. As you saw, servicing fees were up 7% year-over-year in aggregate. I mentioned about 3 percentage points of that was just currency translation. So the underlying growth was around 4%. If we were to decompose the 4% and you know there\u2019s always a mix of items here, the largest positive driver was equity market appreciation. So equity market appreciation across the low equity markets were up north of 20% on average. That translated to about 6% tailwind in servicing fees for the quarter. And then against that we had the normalized amount of -- the normal amount of fee headwinds of about 2%, which brought us down to the net 4%. So it was a good quarter. I think what we continue to focus on is there tends to be some tailwind in our model from flows and client activity. This quarter we had some of that but we also had it a year ago in a good amount, so that was relatively neutral on a year-on-year basis. And then the other component is net new business. And as I\u2019ve said I think pretty clearly, we have had lighter sales quarters over the last four to six quarters. We need to take that up. And as that happens, we\u2019ll be in a position to have net new business growth. For the time being, net new business is relatively neutral, which is okay but not enough and not at the levels that we\u2019d like to be and that\u2019s, I think, partly why we have been real clear around the amount of net new business we need to win. We\u2019ve been actioning that on a segment basis or regional basis. You\u2019ve heard about our coverage model expansion. All those are components of that acceleration, which I think are well along and starting to show some positive results as I highlighted and asset managers, for example, an alternative and that I think will be to our advantage in the coming time periods. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Why don\u2019t I just add to that, the second part of your question, I think what you\u2019re basically asking is how does Alpha fit in all this and how does it change those numbers? Clearly, we\u2019re pleased with the progress with Alpha 3 reported wins in the first quarter. And as we noted, one that we reported already for the second quarter, about a third of our business to be installed, the $463 billion to be installed is Alpha related and we would expect that to grow just given some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about. What that means, though, is these are longer installations. Remember, in effect, we\u2019re becoming the enterprise outsourcer to these clients. So it will be nice revenue impact but we\u2019re talking about 2022 and 2023 revenue impact relatively little of that, certainly the things that we reported for the first quarter will we see in 2021. Alex Blostein : And then maybe a quick one on capital. Obviously, ratios came down sequentially for the reasons that you described, not particularly surprising. I guess maybe talk to us a little bit about the willingness to dip below 5.25% Tier 1 leverage if the balance sheet remains elevated or maybe even grows from here for one reason or another. And if you guys are willing to sort of continue to execute on your capital return plan, how much flexibility do you have going below the low end, I guess, of your target and staying there? Eric Aboaf : We\u2019re on the capital return plan that\u2019s largely driven by our common equity Tier 1 ratios, which had some volatility this quarter but are still solidly above, I think, or we\u2019ll return solidly above the range. So we\u2019ve got confidence in what we can do there. On Tier 1 leverage, there are probably a couple of different aspects of that matter. I think, first, we\u2019d like to operate in this quarter of 5.25% to 5.75%. And we have some little more room in the balance sheet to -- if we get pushed on deposits. But as you remember, we also have some ability to adjust that. If you recall, we added some discretionary deposits over the last two year time period, and those are in the $10 billion, $15 billion, $20 billion range, so there\u2019s some tactical ways we can accommodate clients and then continue to manage the size of the overall balance sheet. I think we certainly have an ability occasionally to move outside and below the range on the 5.25% if we\u2019re the right way around. And right now, it\u2019s right way risk, so to speak, because it\u2019s clients rather is coming to us because of the strength of our brand, that\u2019s pushing that ratio. And so we can always do that for a quarter or two if necessary. And so part of what we\u2019re very mindful of is how do we continue to support our clients during this time of fed easing. And so there are ways to navigate through that during the year, and we kind of see that as just part of our normal business activity. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : So there\u2019s some good things going on in the quarter, but I think the ROE and the pretax margin are still pretty far below targets. I think the margin one is in, over time, given the headwinds on rates and fee waivers that you just described. But on the ROE side, do you view that as simply a function of capital built in getting down to closer to your targets, because it felt like better than an 8% ROE quarter, the momentum in the business feels better than that, but that\u2019s a low ROE, considering all the growth that you built. So just curious on how you think about that. Eric Aboaf : A couple of things just to keep in mind first. First quarter every year is always our low point on margin and ROE because of the seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses. So those come through and then we\u2019ve got to take a full year look. So I\u2019d just be a little cautious on that. I think more broadly in terms of ROE that\u2019s really a focus. I think you\u2019ve seen in our proxy over the last few years, ROE has a management target. We added margin to that and now fee revenue. So we\u2019re incredibly focused on those three major leverage points. And I\u2019ve got to tell you I\u2019ve got entire management team who\u2019s thinking about those every month and every quarter. I think the way I think about ROE is probably from a couple of perspectives in terms of its trajectory. I think, first, continued work on margin. And this year, we\u2019re just trying to hold margins steady, notwithstanding given the falling interest rates. But you\u2019ve seen us actually hold expenses flat and fee revenues up. That is going to, over time, extend margin and filter back into ROE and every 2 points of expansion in margin is a point of ROE. So there\u2019s real, I think, flow through there. And then I think the second one you hinted is around capital return. We\u2019re very pleased to return 100% of earnings this year, this quarter, in the first quarter, in line with the fed limits. We\u2019ve done that again in second quarter. And we\u2019re committed to a pattern of capital return as a way to return capital to investors and to drive up ROE. And so I think there\u2019s a path in that way as well. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Maybe one quick follow-up on the fee waivers. I heard your comments on 15 growing to 50 and 40 net. Just as a sequential number, that\u2019s a big step up. And I know how it works generically, but I\u2019d love to hear how you think about like was a yield wire, obviously, trip, so to speak, in the quarter? And then more importantly, how much and which part of the current needs towards or which reference points need to go up over what level to get us back to a more breathable level, because 15 to 50 is a big step? Eric Aboaf : I think the good news here is while we have some fee, money market fee waivers, we don\u2019t have the size of money market fee waivers that others are seeing around the industry just because of the more institutional nature of our money market complex. So I think that\u2019s some context to help with. The money market fee waivers are effectively driven by short end rates. It could be everything from overnight repo to one month and three month treasuries. And effectively, as one and three month treasuries fell from kind of 8 basis points, 9 basis points down to 3 basis points, 4 basis points and 5 basis points in March, you\u2019re starting to get to the point where the reinvestment rate against the management fee rate starts to be inflected. And as a result, we are at that pressure point. And literally, the 4 basis points or 5 basis point move at the point does have the impact as you\u2019ve seen. I think the good news here is we\u2019ve continuously cash inflows into our complex, part of that comes from the easing and the monitory policy that we\u2019re seeing. Part of that is, I think, we have an attractive set of offerings. And I\u2019ll tell you that that\u2019s all been factored into our guide and part of what we\u2019re managing through. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just maybe one more on rates. Maybe focus on the net interest revenue outlook, the 460 to 465 on a quarterly basis. Given the view of both the forward curve and premium amortization likely easing down over the course of the year, even if short rates are sort of stable where they are now, what would prohibit that 465 from improving in the second half? Is there a mix shift assumption within the next -- I would have thought it would improve as we get to the later part of the year. Eric Aboaf : I think the best way to understand it is the short rates had an impact in the first quarter, and then we\u2019ll now have three months worth of that in the second quarter, so that\u2019s what drives the the additional nudge down from what we would have preferred to have seen. On long end rates, long end rates have been a headwind all through last year as they came down, and now even at this current level are a headwind for the portfolio. They were a headwind in the portfolio, for example, from 4Q to 1Q by about 5 points of NII, but has started to work against the long end rate impact is premium amortization, which has started to come down and that was actually a tailwind sequentially of about 2 points of NII. And so you\u2019re kind of having this continued headwind from long end rates, which just has to play through. Remember, the average duration of the portfolio is about three years. Think about when long rates were -- when the rate cycle started was a year ago, so there\u2019s another year of long end rates being a headwind. What we\u2019re now looking for is the premium amortization to slow down. Now we need to be careful about the pace of that slowing down, but that is expected to slow based on the various models, and that starts to create a partial offset to those long end rate headwinds. And what we\u2019re looking for is the crossover point. And we think sometime in the second half of this year, long end rates will still be a headwind but premium amortization should begin to offset that and thus, the collection of those two will be roughly neutral. And that\u2019s effectively why we don\u2019t see an uptick because that long end rate headwind just continues on effectively for that two to three year time period that has to flow through the books. And what we need to see over time is for premium amortization to fall substantially enough so that there is some uplift. We just don\u2019t see that happening this year. And I think the question is how and when that begins to turn. And what I\u2019m trying to do is avoid getting out ahead of us because we just need to see it play out, and I think we\u2019ll know more in the coming couple of quarters. Brian Bedell : And then on the Invesco win. So just to maybe talk about the calibration of revenue and expense, typically, when you have these installments, there\u2019s a little bit of expense ahead of time before the revenue comes in. Maybe if you could just characterize if that\u2019s the case, or are you actually able to build revenue sort of immediately after it\u2019s installed to offset that? And then I think you were doing the -- correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think you were doing most of the custody fund accounting for Invesco. So this optically would be an add-on in revenue but your custody base wouldn\u2019t change so much. Therefore, it would appear to be a price improvement given you\u2019re getting more revenue from the same customer. Maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit? Eric Aboaf : Brian, let me just step back a little bit because we\u2019re not and we\u2019ve never really talked about individual clients, individual client wins and how we onboard the revenues expenses. You\u2019re getting at a level of, I think, specificity that\u2019s not something we typically go into and we don\u2019t because we want to be respectful of our clients, respectful of various positions. I think what I would tell you is and you\u2019ve seen us with other wins describe them. We often say that there\u2019s a range of products that come over from a client as part of a win, some come more quickly and some take more time. And I think I\u2019ve been on record saying custody tends to come more quickly often, but not always. Accounting, middle office, Charles River takes time. And the larger the installations, the more time it takes. And you are right in your view that some of those expenses we build a bit in advance because we\u2019ve got on board, we\u2019ve got to do some of the professional development and technology connectivity for that. So anyway, I think you have the right outline. And I think what we\u2019re going to to do in general is help everyone understand the momentum of our business. Part of the reason I give the quarterly guidance is to give you a little bit of insight to what we expect. And that\u2019s all of our client activity, all of our wins, our to be installed business factors in. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Deutsche Bank. Betsy Graseck : Ron, I had a question just around how you\u2019re thinking about strategy in SSGA. I mean there\u2019s been some headlines around the fact that perception that you\u2019ve been looking at opportunities over in Europe and wanted to understand how important it is for you to gain share in Europe. And maybe you could broaden out the answer, of course, to just generally the strategy in SSGA. Could you give us a sense as to what you\u2019re looking to do and capability adds that you\u2019re trying to accomplish? Ron O\u2019Hanley: So I mean, I\u2019ll start by just reminding everybody that asset management is a very important business for us. It\u2019s smaller than Investment Servicing but we have quite a good business there. And as we\u2019ve said oftentimes, we\u2019re constantly looking at our strategy. We always look at, first, at organic opportunities to grow and second, inorganic opportunities to grow. And we\u2019ve done a little bit of inorganic, but most of what you see in terms of the progress there has been a result of organic activities, including some of the, as I noted in my remarks, some of the recent growth in Europe. I mean I\u2019m not going to comment on market rumors. We feel very good about the position we have and don\u2019t feel that we have to do something at any point, but we also are looking for opportunities to exploit the position we have and to see if there\u2019s opportunities to grow it. But it will, for us, be primarily driven by organic activities. And secondarily, if there\u2019s something inorganic that makes sense strategically and makes sense to the shareholders then we\u2019ll look at that. Betsy Graseck : And then just separately and maybe if there\u2019s any capability sets there that you\u2019re looking to expand into that would be helpful to understand. But just on the eye in the servicing side, we\u2019ve also seen some announcements on servicing Bitcoin ETFs. And maybe you can give us a sense as to how long you anticipate it takes to bring that to market? And is there anything else you\u2019re doing on the crypto side or digital currency side? In particular, are you going to be looking to service physicals or do you expect to use others to service physicals and subcustodians? Just your strategy there would be helpful to understand. Ron O\u2019Hanley: So there\u2019s a lot of activity in this space and crypto means a lot. It means different things to different people. We\u2019ve been active in certainly digital ledger and blockchain technology for a long time now. We do see this as a growing segment of the marketplace. We\u2019ve got a number of initiatives in place to figure out how we can establish a leadership position there. I think it\u2019s fair to say that the regulatory environment has some catching up to do here and that\u2019s clearly on the minds of regulators, and there\u2019s clearly lots of applications in front of them. But right now, that\u2019s part of the gating factor. But we would view this as a trend that\u2019s here to stay. And I think it\u2019s a combination of how do you think about cryptocurrencies and servicing cryptocurrencies in the fullest form, not just traditional currency but administration. How do you think about in the context of an ETF? What does crypto basket creation look like? But then there\u2019s the other side of this, it\u2019s crypto assets, and we\u2019re very active in thinking about how do we move from custody, something that\u2019s physical or near physical to custodying a token. And what does that mean for us. So it\u2019s a very, very important part of our R&D, and it\u2019s a very, very important part of our share online now. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Betsy, I\u2019d just add that, as Ron described, there\u2019s a whole -- across the whole value chain, all right? There are ways for us to participate in crypto and you\u2019ve seen us do that, announced a forth. I think we\u2019re also very conscious of where is the white space, where are there near-term opportunities. And we think ETF, crypto ETF is an important one. Why? Because it takes something that is a bit on the side, a little bit more retail and makes it mainstream. It makes it mainstream for retail and for institutions. It increases access. And so we\u2019re very active and you saw one announcement. We\u2019ve got a strong pipeline of clients because these are, by and large, our clients who are innovating in crypto ETF. And while many of those need to go through a regulatory approval stage, they all need record keepers and administrators, right? The core of this is the credibility that we could bring. And we think that\u2019s a real area of white space where we can lean in and both support our clients and also be a real important participant and player in one of the emerging spaces. Betsy Graseck : And when do you expect the capability will be up and running? Eric Aboaf : The -- well, there are different capabilities, right? There\u2019s everything from custody of the tokens itself. We often partner to do that, and we had subcustody relationships, just itself. We often partner subcustody relationships in core assets. Recordkeeping and administration is something that we have the capability today to do, which is why we\u2019ve been appointed by several ETF providers who are in various stages of the regulatory approval process. And I\u2019d say that\u2019s not just appointed here in the U.S., but we have pipeline and appointments in -- around the world. Germany is a very advanced market in this space, Canada, Australia. And so -- but that record-keeping administration capability we have today and are ready to roll that out in support of our clients. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Eric, a follow-up -- a couple of follow-up questions on the balance sheet, noticing that the investment portfolio was smaller on both period-end and average, but you had a good amount of deposit growth, so it seems like you actually have more cash sitting around today. Is that -- how do you contemplate that going forward? And are any changes in terms of how you reinvest built into your NII outlook? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Ken, good question. We always have to be mindful of the balance between NII growth driven by the investment portfolio and the amount of AOCI risk that we take, especially now that we\u2019re in place where rates are likely to either stay flat or rise. And the question is, are we going to get a rate shock or not. So we just need to be careful of that. We took a little bit of duration off the table in the first quarter as rates rose. Remember, naturally, our MBS duration will lengthen. And so that was one of the reasons we shortened up is just to protect against that. And I think the team that we had did quite a nice job of doing that early in the quarter, and protected some of what we wanted to around AOCI here. It does put us in a position where we have some cash that we can put to work in the coming quarters that is included in our -- in the outlook that I gave and it will provide a partial offset to the long-end rate downdraft that we continue to see. But we are also at the point where the investment portfolio was resized relative to a year ago by a solid 10% larger. We did that. But it does need to have -- there\u2019s a certain capacity that we can run. And it\u2019s in the right range, though we may -- we will had a little bit, adjust a little bit trade around the edges to make the most with what we have. Ken Usdin : Okay. And to that point, you did mention the episodic increase in RWA. I\u2019m just wondering if you can help us understand how much of a weight was that on the 10.8% CET1? And I think you mentioned getting back above the target range, so just does that come back? And just wondering if this -- how much of an anomaly were the ratios this quarter outside of what we saw in OCI? Eric Aboaf : Yes. The episodic items that I mentioned, two of them were worth about 0.5 point of CET1. So all else being equal, we printed 10.8%. We would have printed 10.2%, 10.3% if they hadn\u2019t flowed through. flag if they come in a little heftier which might occasionally push ratios down a bit or lighter, which sometimes happens as well, which will push ratios up and that\u2019s fine. These are just pretty typical overdrafts occasionally spike up and you spike up overdrafts $2 billion to $3 billion on the base of our balance of it having a sort of derivative positions when the dollar is in the money, strongly, we end up because the book is hedged. We have liabilities and assets in that book. We, in this case, as the dollar strengthened, we ran positive mark-to-market. But that has a -- that gets weighted heavily by the RWA standardized rules. And so you kind of had 4 -- $3 billion to $4 billion RWA move, which actually literally has remediated back over the last two weeks as the dollar move the other -- in the other direction. So anyway, just part of running the business and we\u2019ll always have some of this volatility. But at this time, it costs us about 0.5 point on CET1, and we -- it\u2019s reversed since Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Just curious on the servicing, the outlook. It seems as though there\u2019s some -- I know that this is an imperfect way to model, but it\u2019s the only way we got. It seems as though there\u2019s a decent amount of B-rate compression or the relationship of AUC and AUM to revenues seems to be with revenues lagging given the outlook here and when you look at the full year, it almost suggests as though that will remain intact for the rest of the year. Is there anything specific going on? Does your outlook assume a normalization in the volume-driven components of the servicing fee piece that could be a bit of a headwind to that rate? Or is there some mix going on that\u2019s adverse, if there\u2019s any additional color can give, that would be really helpful. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Brennan, I think the biggest thing that\u2019s happening right now is that as ACA rise very significant due to equity markets and actually are offset a little bit by lower bond markets that we have that anomalous fee rate impact just because it\u2019s not a point for point change. Remember, every 10 points of change in AUCA effectively drives a -- if it\u2019s driven by equity markets, a three-point increase in servicing fees, right? It\u2019s that different, which means the fee rate just naturally and just mathematically comes in lower. It\u2019s not like the asset management business where it tends to almost be percentage linear, where 10% and 10% have played through between AUCA and servicing fees. So I think that\u2019s the biggest item that plays through. If we look at first quarter to first quarter, the year-on-years and you\u2019ll see that for the rest of the year. So I\u2019d just be very careful about that just mathematical result. I think if you step back and open up the lens on servicing fees, and I think you saw we had a good result this quarter sort of seeing fees up 7% year-over-year, nominally, 4% adjusted for currency translation. I guided in second quarter that servicing fees, again, would be in that 7% to 8% range. There\u2019ll be a few points of currency translation that again, but that\u2019s still a very healthy growth rate. A lot of that, most of that is driven by the equity market appreciation offset by some of the bond markets, and that\u2019s part of our business model that\u2019s always part of our business model. And when equity markets are going south, it\u2019s part. And when they\u2019re going up, it\u2019s part. So that\u2019s the large driver right now of the revenue growth, and we think that at these levels of equity markets that we\u2019re at, we\u2019ve got a strong of year-on-year comparisons that we expect for second quarter and then you can -- we could model out for the year. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then when we think about the -- there\u2019s this kind of a little bit of a struggle to me because I know we talked a lot about NII and the outlook, I\u2019m going to beat this dead horse a bit. There was the update that was just sort of late in the quarter in March that seemed to suggest that things were going a little better and maybe we were getting to an inflection on NII. And then the guide here more suggests that there\u2019s plenty to offset those green shoots. So what changed in the -- either the portfolio or in the market that would cause the delta in between the intra-quarter update and here? Because it -- LIBOR is clearly a problem, right? Short rates are they matter to you all and It seems like that\u2019s what\u2019s holding back some of the more constructive dynamics we\u2019re seeing at the long end of the curve. But it seemed like we knew that when we heard the update. So was there something that happened behind the scenes that maybe we weren\u2019t aware of that could have had the outlook maybe take a little off of the outlook or make it a little bit less constructive? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, good question. I appreciate your being candid and direct. I think two things happened exogenously that mattered since the beginning in March when we stirred up the numbers and now. First is we\u2019ve seen the short rates persist at a much lower level. And so I think when we were here early March, where we\u2019re going to have one-month and three-month treasuries sit at four basis points for the rest of the quarter, rest of the year, or were they going to bounce back? And they\u2019ve clearly sat here or been weighted down. So I think that cost us about $5 in first quarter and relative to where we would have been cost us effectively another $5 in 2Q, which means kind of $10 cumulatively in 2Q, $10 in 3Q, $10 in 4Q, so that\u2019s not a -- I think that\u2019s not a welcome development. Now if they bounce back, we\u2019ll have some upside, but that\u2019s real, and then the other one that we\u2019re, I think, all just careful about is the attenuation of the MBS premium amortization. And I think you\u2019ve seen a number of commentators talk about that around the industry. The last print that we all saw from the -- from Fannie, Freddie, had a small acceleration of prepayment rates instead of a downtick. And I think then by folks. But it\u2019s hopefully the last gas on prepayment as rates have boomed up, and now we\u2019re in burnout mode. But I think that slight one month that I\u2019m fairly confident will be one month, it will be a -- and it\u2019s industry-wide, it\u2019s in the Fannie, Freddie data. I think it\u2019s just a reminder that we don\u2019t -- aren\u2019t sure of the pace of the attenuation of the premium amortization in these MBS books that we all run. We just have to be careful. Obviously, if the burnout goes faster and premium amortization falls more quickly, let me tell you, I\u2019ll be the first to signal that because I, like you and many others, are looking for not only the stabilization and we\u2019re confident in the stabilization now. But I\u2019d love to see better than stabilization, we\u2019re just not quite at that point yet. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Eric, can you share with us, obviously, pre-pandemic, State Street\u2019s balance sheet deposits roughly averaged about $175 billion, and now they\u2019re sitting around $247 billion in the current first quarter. And during this time, the Fed, of course, increased its balance sheet dramatically from about $4 trillion to over $7.5 trillion. They\u2019re going to continue with QE, as we all know, at least through the end of the year into next year at $120 billion a month in securities purchases. Can you share with us how are you guys calibrating what kind of deposit growth you\u2019re likely to see as the Fed continues with QE for the remainder of this year and into next year? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it\u2019s Eric. I think that\u2019s the $64,000 question that many banks are wrestling with, especially as some of the rule changes happen for others on SLR and as we think about leverage ratios. And clearly, we\u2019re in a new world. We had seen post the global financial crisis, the expansion of Fed balance sheet and then its recompression and now we\u2019re in a new era again. I think our general view is that the pots of the banking system will roughly track the Fed monetary policy expansion, so it will do so in waves. And I think we saw that in first and second quarter of last year, we saw quite an expansion. And then we saw some flatness in deposit balances. And then as the Fed buying, offset by some of the compression in the treasury\u2019s own portfolio, we saw some further uptick. And we\u2019ve seen that again this year. I think we do expect continued expansion because we expect continued expansion of the Fed balance sheet, we do expect that to come back to banks. And I think from our standpoint, what we\u2019re trying to do is be open for business for our clients, and we\u2019d like to do that every day of the week because that\u2019s important to them. And we\u2019ve got some capacity to accommodate some of this growth as it comes. It\u2019s not infinite that every day of the week because the Fed balance sheet goes up another 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, we have to see when they\u2019re going to -- when they are going to start to constrain their own bond-buying activities slows down, pause, et cetera, we will, at the right time, to have to just work on some of our discretionary pools of deposits. We have those, and we have some capacity to adjust. We\u2019ve got a suite of options for clients. We -- our deposit rates are at zero or near zero. So for clients, we can certainly facilitate other activities at the right point. That\u2019s not for today or tomorrow or next quarter necessarily. It\u2019s -- but it\u2019s in a year or two that comes, right? We can help them sweep to money market funds. We can help them sweep to -- with treasury securities. We can help them sweep into the repo business. And so we\u2019ll have to just navigate through. We feel pretty comfortable where we are today and in the next quarter or 2. But we\u2019ll just have to see if there\u2019s a wave, we\u2019ll address, and I think we\u2019ll just have to navigate through. Gerard Cassidy : And just as a quick follow-up to that. Have you guys disclosed what percentage of your deposits are operational for your customers versus excess where you would have that flexibility to move those deposits maybe elsewhere? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, there is some good disclosure in some of the post quarter-end LCR type information that we and all the banks share. And we can -- I think all the banks share. And we can -- It gives different types of deposits, and it gives different kind of those different liquidity values, which starts to get at some of what you\u2019re describing around operational versus nonoperational, so we can follow up with you. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then as a follow-up question, you guys are not big lenders. I understand that your loan portfolio relative to your total assets is -- or deposits is obviously quite low. But I did notice that the average loans in the quarter were down, but period-end, quarter-to-quarter, were up, I think, 13%. Any color on what drove that increase at the end of the quarter in loans? Eric Aboaf : Yes. We\u2019re always getting a little bit of volatility. I think one of the -- well, one of the things that we have is just overdrafts are coming through as a loan, right, as part of the book, so that\u2019s one. And I mentioned how that, that had a spike up at the end of the quarter. The other one is there\u2019s a good part of our loan book is the private equity firm capital call financing that we do. And that\u2019s had a nice bit of a seasonal effect and then late in the quarter, we\u2019ve -- as we\u2019ve seen these funds start putting more and more capital work, we\u2019d start to have draws on those loans, and those have started to up the -- those draws have added to the balances in a nice way, and that\u2019s one of the reasons that we have -- we see some good continued growth in lending for us. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : I had a big picture question and specific question. Let\u2019s just go with the big picture first. Originally, you were talking about converting SSGA to Charles River, and that would be a flagship client that you could use to sell to other asset managers, is that still something that\u2019s contemplated proceeding? Do you have a time frame for that? How is that looking? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Mike, that\u2019s underway. And it\u2019s proceeding exactly the way I would describe it. It\u2019s a big complex project, so it\u2019s been a good one to -- I mean it was client number one. We\u2019ve obviously got a lot of other clients since then, some of them much simpler and less complex. But yes, it\u2019s very much underway and on track. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then just more generally, as it relates to -- you said new business is neutral. And is that just the environment? Because of the pandemic, it\u2019s tougher to knock on doors? Or is that execution that you\u2019d like to see improve? Now you have talked about the coverage model expansion and I guess there is a -- it takes time to get that. But when you talk internally, do you say, \"Well, it\u2019s the pandemic. It\u2019s been tough to get new customers?\" Or do you say, \"No, you have to do better. We\u2019re raising the bar. We\u2019re raising the intensity.\" Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Mike, we\u2019ve been very open on this with you over the last few quarters. It\u2019s the latter. Much of the natural growth in this industry is not there any longer, right? If you go back 10 years ago, more than that, much of the growth would be existing clients doing -- opening new funds, opening new fund ranges in different parts of the world. A lot of that is already accomplished. And in many cases, you\u2019re seeing fund closures, right, as every distributor is narrowing their range. And there\u2019s a desire for less choice, not more choice. So it absolutely is about increasing intensity, and we\u2019re starting to see that pay off. We can talk a lot about Alpha, but the way to think about this is Alpha and front-to-back as an and, not an or, right? We still have an existing core business in which we see opportunity to increase penetration, increase penetration in medium-sized asset managers, to continue to grow, what we\u2019re doing with asset owners and insurance companies. So it\u2019s very much about the latter with the Alpha, particularly as we continue to land new assignments and install those as being able to provide yet a little bit more growth over the medium to long term. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, I guess, are you nearing the bottom to -- for the NII and the fee waivers? I guess, NII, so your guidance is just a little bit lower than it was in the first quarter, right? It\u2019s not falling off the cliff from -- unless I\u2019m reading something wrong, and the fee waivers net $40 million worse ahead. Just if you could just clarify one more time on the NII and fee waivers? And when do you think we hit bottoms? Eric Aboaf : Mike, it\u2019s Eric. On NII, I think the second quarter is the bottom, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve said likely to be at $460 million to $465 million per quarter for the rest of the year. So I think we\u2019ve -- we\u2019re at the stabilization level, plus or minus a few bucks in that, in and around that range. And given what we know today, so we think that we\u2019re there, we\u2019re confident we\u2019re there. And now the question is how long is it flattish at that level? And then when does it pick up in that? I think we\u2019ll know more in the coming quarters. And on the fee waivers, what we\u2019ve done is forecasted what they\u2019d be for second quarter, the net 40-ish or so offset by balances versus the net 15-or-so from first quarter. But that\u2019s predicated on short rates being where they are today, and they\u2019ve been kind of flattish the last 30, 45 days, and -- but that\u2019s the assumption. We\u2019re obviously hoping short rates stay flat or actually move up, that\u2019s supposed to go the other way. And so it\u2019s just based on that. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Rob Wildhack : On the call in January, you talked about addressing sales to midsized asset managers. And so can you talk about some of the key differences? And maybe challenges between selling to a large asset manager and selling to a midsized one? And then I appreciate that it\u2019s pretty early in that, but any update on your progress in that part of the market would be helpful, too. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Rob, couple of things on this, part of the sale to a medium-sized asset manager is a whole lot more standardization. It\u2019s not to say that they don\u2019t need customization, but we\u2019re -- much of our success over the years was built around servicing very large asset managers. So much of what we\u2019ve been doing has as much to do with standardizing the product as it does around adding to sales and coverage capabilities. But at the same time, we\u2019ve recognized that how you sell and service to them, including having a way to scale up service in such a way that they\u2019re receiving the appropriate amount of service, at a cost to serve that works for us. And again, that has required us to, in effect, establish a parallel model here and to make sure that we\u2019re delivering expected service that we\u2019re doing it in a way that can be done at the right unit cost for us. So -- and that work is underway. This is not a -- I mean, we\u2019ve talked to you about this on a new problem. And at the same time, what we also want to be able to do is there\u2019s many firms at that median level, that either through their sophistication through their range of products actually do need and can tolerate pricing was a bit of a higher service model. So a lot of this is about really understanding and segmenting the client base and getting our clients into the right bucket, if you will, and making sure that they truly are satisfied based on what their needs that they\u2019re not underserved and they\u2019re not overserved. Rob Wildhack : That\u2019s really helpful. And then earlier this year, too, you announced an expansion of business in Latin America. And I was wondering if you could talk more about the opportunity there, and the potential for international expansion, Lat-Am, and otherwise, to be a source of growth going forward? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, historically, we\u2019ve seen a lot of our growth come from outside the U.S. Very relatively little of it, though, from Latin America, we\u2019ve had elsewhere. We actually have a small but very loyal client base there. We\u2019ve put a few people. This is not a massive investment on our part, but we\u2019ve put a few very skilled veteran people covering that market now, and we\u2019re already seeing some really attractive green shoots. So we see this as a medium- to long-term opportunity. Activity is already happening, even though we\u2019re less than a year into this intensified effort. And so we see it as a nice supplement to what we already have in place in EMEA and APAC. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Ron and Eric, a couple of questions for you, folks. Asset management fees, which were down about 1% linked quarter ex FX translation. You mentioned that it was due to client asset reallocation. What was that? And was it a onetime thing? Or -- and how much of an impact did that have? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Vivek, it\u2019s -- I would describe it as idiosyncratic is maybe the best way to describe it. It was an extremely large client, a corporate pension fund and was doing what a lot of corporate pension funds are doing these days, right, derisking. So move from quite high up on the fee schedule to a much more of a derisked environment as a result of their asset allocation. I mean that\u2019s a trend that we\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s not new, but the fact that it happens is such a very lower plant that was a very big or it\u2019s gone, ask it all content allocation before them, made it show up in our results the way it has. Vivek Juneja : Eric, one for you, just a follow-on to an earlier question on NII growth in your liquid assets and your securities on an average basis were flattish linked quarter. What level of rates do you want to see before you\u2019re willing to move some of this liquidity into higher-yielding securities? Or is there something else that would drive you to do that, Eric? Eric Aboaf : There really, Vivek, it\u2019s Eric. There really two -- probably, two or three triggers or break points for us. I think one is the outright level of rates in -- we\u2019ve seen some good movement in 10, we\u2019ve not seen that much movement in 5s. And so the question is a little bit, when does the curve more broadly move because we -- while we\u2019d like to put more money to work, we need to be a little careful of our duration because with duration comes AOCI volatility. And so it\u2019s and so it\u2019s curve that would be good to see. And right now, 5s are in the, whatever, 85, 90 basis point range, it\u2019d be nice to see them a good bit higher. And 10s, for 10s to pay off, either in clean duration treasuries or an MBS, we need higher rates, a good bit higher before where we\u2019re on to make that trade at the right levels of higher rates, you get the benefit if rates were to come down off a positive AOCI, so that\u2019s helpful. But we\u2019re not at that level where we -- everything great is going to come back down very quickly. And so we actually need more of an upswing before we really lean into the trade. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t trade around the edges and trade the slope and so forth, but that\u2019s probably a little bit of framing that might help. Vivek Juneja : One quick one. Just -- you had legal and other costs of $29 million, but I noticed $28 million of it was in transaction processing and info systems. Can you give a little color on what was involved there? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Vivek, this was a legacy matter that dates a number of years ago. There were some costs that we, at this time, thought were reimbursable that were by either clients or other partners that we had. They did accumulate on the balance sheet, and we came to the conclusion recently that they\u2019re not reimbursable. And so effectively, they need to be expensed, and so we cleaned up the books here. But it dates back a number of years, and we made the adjustment accordingly. And then I don\u2019t know if Ken is still on, operator, but just to clarify, I misspoke a little bit on his RWA question. RWA was up, as I said, for -- in an episodic way about $5 billion or $6 billion this quarter. Had it not been up, our $10.8 million CET1 ratio would have been in the 11.2% to 11.3% range. Operator : Your next question comes from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia : Just a quick question. For Charles River, can you comment on your competitive environment and retention trends? And how much of your new wins is from competitive takeaway versus firms deciding to outsource? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. I mean in terms of the competitiveness of the product, I mean, it\u2019s competitive. I mean it\u2019s -- you can look at it through its -- both its penetration. You can look at it when you lay it alongside our other competitors just in terms of the R&D and the software development we\u2019ve put into it. In terms of the new business achieved, it tends to be a mix. And in many cases, it\u2019s replacing the proprietary OMSs or risk analytics systems or systems that were put in that really aren\u2019t being supported anymore. That tends to be most of it. And I think that tends to be most of it for our big competitors. There\u2019s a little bit of takeaway going on, typically, when somebody is doing some consolidating, but it\u2019s not so much takeaway as it is replacing something proprietary or something that\u2019s just no longer being supported. Which is, by the way, what makes the market attractive versus inherent growth in the market as opposed to duking it out with existing strong competitors. Rajiv Bhatia : Got it. So like your double-digit growth outlook, that doesn\u2019t necessarily much like competitive displacement? Ron O\u2019Hanley: No. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open. Brian Kleinhanzl : Just two quick questions for Eric kind of around the guidance. More clarification questions here. On that full year fee revenue guidance that you gave, was that inclusive or exclusive of the money market fee waivers? Eric Aboaf : That was inclusive. So it\u2019s all in guidance. It covers all the ins and outs of the business, including the update on money market fees. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then also on the guidance, 2Q and full year, were you giving that as of where the equity markets were as of quarter end or as of today, obviously, the move in the markets quarter-to-date thus far? Eric Aboaf : I think I\u2019ve split the difference on that. It\u2019s -- the market\u2019s moved so much, we\u2019re trying to give some directional guidance. I think the -- for equity markets, we\u2019re still assuming the point-to-point increase in the period last year and the period this year of 10 percentage points. We\u2019ll see if that stays or not, given where we are, and we wrote this over the last week. So, we\u2019re also assuming equity markets stay around where they are now, which would line up with that endpoint as well. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to Mr. O\u2019Hanley for closing remarks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, operator, and thanks to all for your questions. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you throughout the quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this morning, we released strong second quarter financial results, which demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making towards achieving our medium-term targets as we continue to execute on the multiyear strategic pivot of our business to that of an enterprise outsourced solutions provider. I am particularly pleased with our results, as quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history. We delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of servicing fee growth, with servicing fees at the highest level in three years, propelled by both strong equity markets and the impact of our actions to strengthen relationship management and sales effectiveness. We continue to differentiate State Street through our unique product and operational capabilities, as well as through delivering enhanced client service quality. Our pipeline continues to deliver as evidenced by another strong -- another quarter of strong servicing and Alpha client mandates, which I will discuss shortly. Additionally, we continue to invest in our business and innovate across the franchise to drive growth and enduring shareholder value creation. For example, we announced the formation of State Street Digital in the second quarter, a new division focused on addressing the industry\u2019s evolving shift to digital finance, both as product offerings and as a business model. This is just one example in a long history of innovation that State Street has and is continuing to drive within our industry. We also continue to develop State Street Alpha, our front to back offering. This unique capability has created an attractive value proposition that is resonating with both new and existing clients, as well as contributing to client retention and growth opportunities, which I will also discuss shortly. Turning to slide three, I will review our second quarter highlights before handing the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Second quarter EPS was $2.07 or $1.97 excluding notable items. Despite the impact of our -- of interest rates on our NII earnings per share ex notables reached the highest level since 4 Q 2019 when quarterly NII was notably higher more than 35% more than it was into Q2 2021. Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, increasing 6% year-over-year, driven by solid servicing and management fee growth, which increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively, as well as better securities finance results. The strong performance was partially offset by the year-over-year impact on total revenues from lower software and processing fees, continued moderation of FX market volatility and ongoing interest rate headwinds. Even with record quarterly fee revenue, expenses were well controlled. While second quarter total expenses were up 1% relative to the year ago period, they were down almost 0.5 percentage point year-over-year, excluding notable items and currency translation, as our productivity improvements continued to yield results. We have created a culture of expense discipline over the last two and a half years, and we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs over the remainder of 2021. Our strong fee revenue performance, coupled with continued cost discipline, delivered a 200-basis-point improvement to our pretax margin year-over-year, which reached nearly 30% in the second quarter, excluding notable items. Further return on equity was 12.6% or 11.9% excluding notable items in the second quarter. AUC/A increased to a record $42.6 trillion at quarter end, supported by higher period end equity market levels and new business onboarding. New asset servicing wins increased to $1.2 trillion for the quarter, including the large Alpha mandate with Invesco announced in April. We reported two new Alpha wins in the second quarter, taking the total number of Alpha clients to 15. After the second quarter close, we also entered into an Alpha mandate with Legal & General. Well Invesco is an example of how Alpha is helping to expand and deepen existing client relationships, the Legal & General win demonstrates how the Alpha strategy is also helping us forge new client relationships with the world\u2019s most sophisticated investors. Our experience to-date gives us confidence that Alpha relationships will drive stronger retention rates for existing clients, while also allowing us to broaden and deepen those relationships as we add additional products and services to these existing mandates. Additionally, we are signing Alpha clients that are new to State Street, demonstrating that Alpha is enabling us to reach new clients and deliver front, middle and back office services in a differentiated manner. We also create the new relationships to help drive revenue growth of costs across clients segments and regions. For example, earlier this week we announced the new strategic alliance with First Abu Dhabi Bank. The alliance will create a full service enterprise offering for institutional investors in the Middle East and North Africa region. It will provide investors with extensive reach into more than 100 markets around the world. Clients will have access to State Street\u2019s full suite of front, middle and back office capabilities in addition to our extensive data management and analytics solutions, which seamlessly integrates with First Abu Dhabi Bank\u2019s regional suite of security services products, local expertise and regional direct custody network. At CRD, annual recurring revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $230 million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing, while also enabling and propelling our Alpha strategy. Global Advisors continued to demonstrate strong performance, AUM increased to $3.9 trillion and management fees increased to $504 million, both records benefiting from strong second quarter flows of $83 billion across the ETF, institutional and cash businesses, as we continue to leverage the strengths of our asset management franchise. In ETFs, our low cost and sector funds, as well as our ESG and commodity products continuing to enjoy good market share with low cost ETFs expanding share in the second quarter. And an institutional, our sales force and relationship management realignment, coupled with a strong products that lead to good revenue growth. Turnings to our balance sheet and capital, we returned over $600 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter, inclusive of $425 million of common share repurchases consistent with the limits set by the Federal Reserve. I am pleased with yet another strong performance under this year\u2019s annual stress test. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to manage our capital pace. As examples, yesterday we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a 10% increase of our third quarter common dividend to $0.57 per share and authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion during the third quarter of 2021 through the fourth quarter of 2022. To conclude, we had a very strong quarter, business momentum is building and we have demonstrating meaningful progress towards our medium-term financial targets. As I look ahead to support our strategic vision and help us achieve those targets, we are continuing to prioritize improvement in our fee revenue growth, while controlling costs by transforming the way we work and building a higher performing organization for the future. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my review of our second quarter results on slide four. We reported EPS of $2.07 or $1.97, excluding the $0.10 positive impacts of notable items, which was driven by a previously announced sale of majority stake in a legacy business. On a left panel of the slide, you can see strong results as we continue to drive fee revenue growth while controlling expenses. We delivered pretax margin expansion and solid earnings growth. As a result of the weaker dollar relative to the year ago period, we continue to show our year-on-year results excluding the impact of currency translation in the right column. We also show results excluding notable items on the bottom of the slide. Turning to slide five, you will see our business volume growth, period end AUC/A increased 27% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter to a record $42.6 trillion. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 28% year-on-year and 9% quarter-on-quarter to $3.9 trillion, also a record. The year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher period end market levels coupled with net inflows. Turning to slide six, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Second quarter servicing fees increased 10% year-on-year, including currency translation, which was worth approximately 3 percentage points year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average market levels, positive net new business onboarded and client flows, only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and the absence of elevated prior year client activity. AUC/A wins totaled $1.2 trillion in the second quarter substantial -- substantially up from recent quarters, primarily as a result of the large Alpha client mandate announced last April that John just -- that Ron just mentioned. AUC/A won but yet to be installed also amounted to $1.2 trillion at quarter end, as we smoothly on boarded over $400 billion of client assets this past quarter. We remain focused on reigniting business growth across both client segments and regions. This quarter, we have strong growth in the EMEA region, aided by our intense coverage efforts, which now extend to approximately 350 overall of our top clients. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in growth AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds, and we have clearly exceeded that mark this year. I will remind you that installations typically occur in phases and overtime and deals will vary by fee and product mix. At this time, we expect the current won but yet to be installed AUC/A will be converted over the coming 12-month to 24-month time period with the associated revenue benefits beginning in 2022 and the majority occurring in 2023. As we said in June, we are pleased with our pipeline and our momentum. Turning to slide seven. Second quarter management fees reached a record $504 million, up 14% year-on-year inclusive a 2-percentage-point impact from currency translation and were up 2% quarter-on-quarter resulting in investment management pretax margin approaching 35%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee performance benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These benefits were only partially offset by the run rate impact from the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation, as well as about $25 million of money market fee waivers this quarter. While we previously estimated that money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $35 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short end rates following the June FOMC meeting, we now expect that they will be about $20 million to $25 million per quarter for the rest of the year, which is about a third lower than we had previously expected. Global Advisors record solid flows across institutional, ETFs and cash for the quarter, with took -- the total amount amounting to $83 billion. We have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises, which are driving this momentum as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. Turning to slide eight, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remain above pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter. Relative to a strong second quarter in 2020, FX revenue fell 12% year-on-year as declining FX market volatility compared to the COVID environment last year, more than offset higher client volumes. FX revenue was down 17% quarter-on-quarter to invite moderation of client volumes from index rebalances experienced in the first quarter and lower market volatility. Our securities finance business recorded strong revenue growth, with fees increasing 18% year-on-year and 10% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher enhance custody and agency balances as clients leverage rebounded. Finally, second quarter software and processing fees were down 12% year-on-year, largely due to the absence of prior year positive mark-to-market adjustments. Software and processing fees increased 24% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of higher CRD revenues. Moving to slide nine, I\u2019d like to provide some further updates on our CR D and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, primarily reflecting higher client renewals and episodic fee revenues. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely and were up 10% year-on-year, resulting in an increase in standalone annualized recurring revenue to $230 million. This quarter marks a three-year anniversary since announcing the CRD acquisition and we are very pleased with how the business has performed. We are winning in part thanks to State Street\u2019s brand and reputation, and the benefit to clients of our integrated Alpha offering. On the bottom right of the slide we show some of the second quarter highlights from State Street Alpha mandates. We reported two new Alpha mandates during the second quarter, as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception through the second quarter, we now have five Alpha client mandates that are live. Although, Alpha deals usually take somewhat longer to implement given the size and scope, the payoff outweighs the longer implementation period as we are able to further expand share wallet to generate attractive revenue growth rates and increase the contract length, which can be up to 10 years in length for Alpha services that span the front and middle office. Turning to slide 10, second quarter NII declined 16% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the effects of lower interest rate environment, our investment portfolio yields and sponsored member repo products. These impacts were partially offset by balance sheet expansion driven by higher balances. Relative to the first quarter, however, NII was flat has lower investment portfolio yields and the impact of short end rates were offset by further expansion of the investment portfolio and lending activity. On the right side of the slide, we show the growth of our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Total average deposits increased by $16 billion in the second quarter or an increase of 7% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the continued impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s expansionary monetary policy. While we continue to remain mindful of OCI risk in the current rate environment, we tactically added about $5 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio a few months ago, before the recent downdraft in rates. We also increased our average loan balances by approximately 5% quarter-on-quarter to over $29 billion, driven by higher utilization by asset managers and private equity capital call clients. We also have a number of initiatives in flight to reverse and reduce this recent deposit uptake that we saw during the quarter. Turning to slide 11, second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by the weaker dollar. Excluding the impact of notable items and currency translation, total expenses were down nearly 0.5 percentage point year-on-year, as productivity savings for the quarter more than offset higher revenue related expenses and targeted investments and client onboarding costs. Compared to 2Q 2020, on a line item basis and excluding notable items and the impact of currency translation, compensation employee benefit costs was flat as we reduce high costs location headcount, which offset higher medical costs as claims began to normalize to pre-pandemic levels. Information systems and communications were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology estate. Transaction processing was up 10%, primarily driven by higher revenue related expenses for subcustody balances and market data costs. Occupancy was down 13%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts and some timing benefits. And other expenses were down 11%, primarily driven by lower than usual professional services fees. Relative to the first quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by the absence of seasonal and deferred compensation reported in the first quarter. So, overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate expense discipline, as we have effectively managed total expenses ex notables and currency down year-on-year in the second quarter, while driving strong total fee revenue growth. Moving to slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are pleased with our performance under this year CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well below the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at that floor. The new SCB framework provides us with additional flexibility to deploy our capital base in a number of different ways, including investment opportunities, dividends and buybacks. For example, yesterday we announced a 10% increase to our third quarter common dividends to $0.57 per share and our Board has authorized a common share repurchase program of up to $3 billion from the third quarter of 2021 through a year-end 2022. In addition, we are also pleased that the Federal Reserve has provided State Street with one additional year until January 1, 2024, to retain its current G-SIB surcharge of 1%. To the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels in excess of the requirements. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 11.2% as we had expected and sits above the upper end of our 10% to 11% CET1 target range. The improvement was driven by solid capital appreciation and we also manage down RWAs despite balance sheet growth. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio remains well above the regulatory minimum, but declined by 20 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 5.2%, primarily as a result of the further increase in average client balances as the Fed\u2019s quantitative easing continues. We continue to think that our Tier 1 leverage ratio in the 5s as appropriate for our business model. And we can operate the lower end of this range for a number of quarters, while we consciously limit and reduce client deposits and offer them a range of liquidity alternatives. Turning to slide 13, in summary, our quarterly performance demonstrates solid business momentum on our topline and the scale we are driving within our operating model. Total fee revenue was up almost 6% year-on-year and exceeded $2.5 billion for the first time, with double-digit growth in servicing and management fees, despite the year-on-year headwind from the strong FX trading services results we had in the second quarter of last year during COVID. Our expenses remain well controlled as a result for productivity program. As a result, we were able to drive pretax margin and ROE close to our medium-term targets, notwithstanding the low rate environment. Next, I\u2019d like to update you on our economic outlook for the remainder of the year and provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter outlook. At a macro level, our rate view broadly aligns the current forward rate curve and assumes that short end rates remain low and there is some modest deepening to the yield curve. We are also assuming global equity markets will be relatively flat to quarter end for the rest of the year, as well as continuing normalization of FX market activity. In terms of the third quarter of 2021, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 7% to 8% year-over-year, with servicing and management fees each expected to be up 7% to 9% year-over-year. This means full year fee guidance is likely to be better than the upper end of the full year range we previously provided. Regarding NII, despite the recent flattening of the yield curve, we have seen an increase in short end market rates and we now expect a modestly improved quarterly NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the rest of the year. Assuming rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to attenuate. Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs. We expect that third quarter expenses ex notable items will be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 percentage point year-over-year in 3Q. These fee and expense guides for 3Q include approximately a point of currency translation year-over-year. On taxes, we expect that the 3Q 2021 tax rate will be in the middle of our full year range of 17% to 19%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. And with that, Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Thanks very much. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I just start -- wanted to start off by talking a little bit about the fee guide that you just went through. Could you just give us a sense as to the major drivers? I mean, I realized that throughout the call, you were talking about the pipelines up? You have got a reinvigorated sales effort going on? Is that what\u2019s driving this so quickly or is there something else that\u2019s happening that leads you to the fee guide raise? Thanks. Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. Betsy, why don\u2019t I start and Eric will comment. I mean, it\u2019s -- I wouldn\u2019t describe it as so quickly. I mean, what you are seeing here is the product of a lot of months and years of work that\u2019s now coming together and starting to bear fruit. So and not that we were done. We have more work to do. But I think really it is about some of the things that we have told you in the past that we have been up to that are coming together and starting to have the impact -- the desired impact here. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe you could just refresh how you are thinking about the asset management business and where you would like to lean into growth, what pockets you are looking to invest in and if that\u2019s by geography, too, that would be helpful? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. I mean, they -- we think of the business is having three core elements to it, the ETF business, the institutional business and the cash business. And both are well established franchises. The areas that we like to lean into are the institutional business, first, and I will come back to the ETF business. But the institutional business has very strong client relationships around the world, but a limited product set. So what -- we spent a lot of time thinking about is, how do we take those relationships and that distribution channel and leverage it in some way through enhancing our product capabilities. On the ETF side, we have been on a long path to developing the products that there, as well as deepening our presence in geographies outside the U.S. You have seen a lot of payoff from that particularly in EMEA. We will continue to grow that. Areas of growth include ESG, which for us continues to do very nicely, as well as just continuing to emphasize the advantages of our core product set. It was an -- it\u2019s an institutionally designed product set. It has a lot of liquidity to it. And liquidity is important to many investors. So it\u2019s emphasizing what we have there. And then the cash business is, obviously, it\u2019s a function of interest rates. But we have a very sophisticated cash business that works in different interest rate environments and we will continue to present that to both existing asset management and asset servicing clients, as well as clients that don\u2019t have either of those relationships with us. Betsy Graseck : Thanks, Ron. Thanks, Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for the -- hey. How are you, Ron? Hi, Eric. So another follow-up on the updated outlook. I noticed, Eric, that you said, we are going to be above the upper end of the range for the full year, which doesn\u2019t seem that challenging, given how strong things were here in the second quarter and given how good 3Q looks at this point. Is it possible to narrow that full year fee revenue outlook to something more specific than just a greater than sign? How are you thinking about it and how should we think about it? And then also what are your assumptions for balance sheet size embedded in the updated NII outlook? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Brennan, it\u2019s Eric. Let me describe it this way. I think we are seeing very good performance across a number of our businesses. In addition to some of the tailwinds that you get from equity markets and I think it\u2019s a combination of both. Equity markets are up globally quarter-on-quarter 5%. So that gives us another step up for servicing and management fee businesses. But in addition, I think, what we are seeing is strength in net new business revenues. Last quarter, I said, we were relatively neutral on net new business and servicing fees. This quarter we are nicely positive on that front on the servicing fee side. In management fees, we have been booking a couple quarters here in a row of very nice inflows. They have come with annualized net new revenues that are solidly positive and create a tailwind as well. And then you saw, we have had good performance across our sec lending franchise, CRD had another good quarter and so we are comfortable with a higher guide. I think I gave you primarily third quarter information and then maybe just try to answer the question directly. The full year fee guide, if you recall, was taken up last quarter to 2.5% to 4% year-over-year. Remember that includes lapping ourselves from the COVID bumps from FX a year ago. So our guide has had been 2.5% to 4% for total fee growth. And I think now you can count on around 5% growth. So we are going to go from that range to about another point up over the top end of that range for the time being given what we know today. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Great. That\u2019s fair. And the balance sheet size piece of the NII? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. The balance sheet always has puts and takes and ins and outs in this environment of quantitative easing. And what you have seen us do is we have tried to put some of the additional deposits to work, you have seen us take advantage of the increase in IOER and the Fed floor on the on repo rate. So that\u2019s been constructive. We do need to manage also the size of the balance sheet, because as we compress the balance sheet that frees up leverage ratio capacity and then that feeds back into our ability to return capital. And so, we are pretty serious about compressing some of those deposits. We had more of an uptick in May and June. April was kind of roughly in line with the first quarter and so we are starting to chip away at that and we see a path to do that. I don\u2019t think that will have much of an effect on NII. Remember at these low rates, deposits, when you -- the incremental deposit is worth a little bit, but not a lot. But it will be the right way to manage the balance of NII, which I think will comfortably sit in that new range that we have provided, while also freeing up space for capital return, which is an important priority for us. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for providing that clarification, Eric. You also in your prepared remarks mentioned that fee rates vary. When you think about the nice uptick in your won but not funded mandates here. What is those fee dynamics look like? How should we think -- when we are starting to think about modeling, building those out from here? Are those -- is -- does the success of Alpha that you have had and Charles River, which we saw in the results today? Does that help support the fee rates for the businesses that you are working or is the competition just still so intense that that\u2019s just too optimistic? How should we think about those fees that are oncoming? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Brennan. It\u2019s Eric again. I think there\u2019s a real range here. What you tend to get, it\u2019s not whether its Alpha deals or classic cutting accounting deals. It\u2019s really the size of the deals tend to come at different fee rates. And so, we saw some larger deals this quarter and because it\u2019s the denominator of assets is larger, they will come a little lighter in terms of fee rate. On the other hand, in first quarter, we had a set of wins that were well above our traditional fee rate. And so you kind of have a number of combinations and what we are always doing is on a profitability basis and on an incremental basis, always making sure that as we add revenues, we do it at healthy margins. We use it as a way to control our costs and be disciplined. And so I think fee rates will bounce around for wins in one quarter versus the next. But we are actually quite pleased with the fee rate for the first half of the year is well in line with our overall fee rate for the company and that bodes well as we leg into and implement some of these new wins. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, Eric and Ron. Just wanted to ask a little bit more on the capital return, just in terms of how you land on the $3 billion number vis-\u00e0-vis your balance sheet potentially uses and also your capital ratio targets. Are you aiming for a total return payout? How are you -- under this new SCB, how do you kind of land on that number and how should we be thinking about, whether there\u2019s would be potentially more room depending on some of those other factors? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Ken, it\u2019s Eric. They are always facts and circumstances on individual capital return at any time in place. But let me give you the kind of the envelope and how we think about it from our standpoint about what\u2019s possible and what we would like to do knowing that there\u2019s always -- that they always have to manage to the individually to the quarters. But the SCB does give us some flexibility. So let me do it in the following way. One of the things we start with is, what is our CET1 ratio and you saw we put an 11.2%. The first thing you can do is compare that to what\u2019s the target range 10% to 11%. You can say, look, first step is, how do we float down that ratio to the midpoint of that range and that provides $700 million and $800 million of capital or return capacity. So that\u2019s one piece. Secondly, you go through earnings, earnings next quarter, the quarter after you guys will have projections of earnings. And what we do with those earnings, and say, how do we give those earnings back to shareholders in the form of capital return. So, one part of that is the dividend. And then the balance of the earnings can often be returned as buybacks. So that\u2019s a -- that\u2019s an intention we often have. So you can add those buybacks that cover the difference between earnings and dividends for the next, two quarters, three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters, because we gave you kind of a six quarter view. And then finally the one thing you have to keep in mind is the balance sheet always grows a bit, not at the same intensity that that lending oriented bank does, but our balance sheet might grow risk weighted assets by 5%. So there\u2019s kind of a -- there\u2019s always a bit of capital retention that\u2019s necessary just to fund on $120 billion RWA 5%, you always need to retain maybe $600 million typically in a year of capital to hold against that. So if you go through those pieces, it\u2019s literally the down -- the floating down. It\u2019s the -- what earnings can support net of the dividend goes into buybacks and then it\u2019s the modest amount of retention you need for some good underlying growth, which I think, pencils out to that up to $3 billion range. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks for that call. Second question just on your NII guide and the range, you mentioned that premium am would continue to attenuate. Just wondering if you can help us understand how much attenuation would you expect and where was it this quarter versus some of the other factors that are kind of working against it to kind of keep us in the zone? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Premium amortization actually is a bit bouncy from one quarter to the next, just given kind of where you are with individual bonds and so forth. But what\u2019s happening is, you have got the grind on the investment portfolio, which can be in the $15 million to $25 million range. And then premium amortization can work in the opposite direction in the upcoming quarter as we are thinking it\u2019s in the $15 million range, but it will bounce around. And so you kind of have this headwind of rates just floating through, premium amortization going the other way. But it can bounce around plus minus $5 million easily from one quarter to the next and that\u2019s the kind of thing we just want to be careful of. What is nice is, we are starting to get to a leveling off of the net yields on the portfolios, roll-offs are starting to get better matched with roll-ons. That\u2019s a good word to use roll-off and roll-on of bonds. And so you saw that we printed net yield on the investment portfolio without 1.11%, 1.12%. We are pretty close to the bottom of that yield and that\u2019s what gives us comfort that we are in this range for the time being, though, as you could see from my prepared remarks. We took the that -- the upper end of that range up a bit, just because of the improvement in front end rates. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay. Thanks, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : So it\u2019s good -- hello, there. So it\u2019s good to see the margin back to the 30% range and if I listen not too carefully, I hear good markets, good organic growth, better commentary about fees, NII and fee waivers and continue to control expenses. So is -- the question is the 30%-ish margin here to stay for now, because it sounds like everything is moving in the right direction right now? Eric Aboaf : I think -- Glenn, it\u2019s Eric. I think here to stay is a pretty definitive term. I think what you can see is a solid progression over time in our margin and while one quarter doesn\u2019t make a year, it doesn\u2019t -- isn\u2019t the intention that we have. I think you can see progress. I think you can see progress over quarters. You can see progress over years. I think there was a time when we would have taken the equity market tailwind and years ago, you would have seen expenses creep up a lot more than they did this quarter. And so I think you are seeing a discipline that\u2019s pushing margin in the right direction and I think we are pleased with our performance. We would like to do it again and again. But that\u2019s the -- I think the focus and the intensity we bring. But good results, I think, right direction and we -- as Ron said in some of his remarks, this has taken quarters and years to get to this point, but we need to keep at it to consistently deliver this kind of result. Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. Glenn, what I would add too is, as you know, margin is a part of our medium-term targets. We laid out those targets at a time when there was a very different NII picture. So it\u2019s taking longer than we would have liked, but it\u2019s very much part of what we said we were going to deliver. It\u2019s built into management compensation. So I think that you should expect as much intensity around it tomorrow as you have seen up to now. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Just one quick follow-up, on First Abu Dhabi, I just want to understand, is this eventually replacing outsourcing global custody in the region? Is there a broader mandate? I wonder if you could expand on what you expect or hope out of the relationship. Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. So, I mean, we have talked in the past about our intensified efforts in the Middle East. I mean, we have been there for a while. But we have taken a number of steps to augment our presence there. We have got full licenses or we have got licenses now in Saudi Arabia. Think of First Abu Dhabi as doing two things. One, we become the global custodian for their client base. Two, they become our subcustodian in regions where -- in parts of that region where we don\u2019t have local custody. So replace other subcustodians in our network. Glenn Schorr : How quickly can that happen based on subcustodian fees? Ron O'Hanley: I mean it\u2019s starting now. I mean, we will start, obviously, there\u2019s contracts that need to move and things like that. But it will happen pretty quickly over months and a couple of quarters, not years. Glenn Schorr : Excellent. Thank you for all that. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : Hi. Good morning everybody on Friday. I was hoping to get a couple of questions on CRD. I guess, one, can we get an update on the uninstalled revenue backlog, $93 million? What\u2019s the typical timeframe of those installations? And when it comes to new bookings, the $19 million, any color you guys could provide around client types and service types that are embedded with the $19 million that would be helpful. And then, I guess, just a numeric question, sorry, if I missed it, Eric, did you guys mention the episodic benefit, how much debt contributed to the quarter in CRD specifically? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Alex, it\u2019s Eric. Let me touch on each of those, because we are real pleased with the CRD performance both in terms of this quarter\u2019s wins, the backlog, I think, the momentum, and obviously, how it contributes to the broader State Street whole. Just to take through the new bookings, $19 million for the quarter was a five-quarter high. Some of that, I think, you can easily ascribe to the Invesco win, which was front office, middle office, back office, as we continue to expand that relationship and you would have within the $19 million, the front office piece of that win. On the uninstalled backlog, the $93 million, it\u2019s a mix of installations that come over six months, 12 months, 18 months, in some cases, 24 months. What I will remind you is that the longer installations tend to come with professional services fees as you prepare and do those implementations. The classic -- in the classic software sense, those get reimbursed and paid as part of many of the contracts, until you get to the go-live period, which in some cases a short for smaller installations. In other cases, it takes longer, just given the size and complexity of what we are onboarding. And then, I think, finally, you asked about the total revenues. The on-premise revenues were hit a high of another high, just like a year ago, coincidently of $63 million. Some of that was the classic re-upping of installations and that renew from three-year-old contracts, five-year-old contracts, that kind of stuff. I think some of the most episodic items in there are probably in the $20 million to $25 million range. So I just encourage you guys to take an average of quarters over five quarters, nine quarters, that kind of thing and that will give you a better sense for what\u2019s typical in that on-premise line, but maybe that\u2019s enough to start with. Alex Blostein : Yeah. That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up around capital and just a follow-up to Ken\u2019s question earlier. The fact that you guys are a little bit below your -- the low end of your target on Tier 1 leverage, it sounds like there\u2019s room to manage those deposits out over time. How does that inform just the pace of buyback from here, the $3 billion that you guys got authorized last night? Should we think of that evenly spread out through the end of 2022 or a little bit more back-end loaded as you guys work through the balance sheet dynamics? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. That\u2019s a fair question, because we have got to balance a number of different factors. I\u2019d tell you on Tier 1 leverage, we are comfortable operating in the 5s and this is right way risk. If you think about it, we have got an influx of deposits. They are held at the safest place in the world, the Fed and the central banks. And so we are not particularly exercised that bumping at or even down a bit from the lower end of that range. So that\u2019s fine as long as we have plans over time that we can execute and we do have those plans. That\u2019s what we do for a living. And as I mentioned, we have got actions in place. Some of those deposits came in a little heavier in May and June. We have got a set, for example, of ongoing client discussions of a mix of commitments and ongoing discussions, for example, around $10 billion of those that are literally happening, that have happened last week, this week, and so there are ways for us to chip away at that. In terms of the buyback patterning, while it\u2019s always dependent on facts and circumstances and exactly what\u2019s going on at any point in time. We don\u2019t have an interest in back loading buybacks necessarily, like, we would rather do them relatively smoothly, again all else being equal. And we think we have plenty of capacity given our higher levels of capital ratios and our strength and the confidence we have on our deposit management efforts to deliver those in a relatively consistent way, and in a way, I think, that shareholders would appreciate. Alex Blostein : Awesome. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi. Good morning, folks. I just want to come back to the balance sheet one more time, in terms of the size and how you are managing that. I don\u2019t know if I missed it for the $460 million to $470 million quarterly guide, your -- what\u2019s embedded in the size of the balance sheet, given that it did spike up in the second quarter, if that\u2019s -- if your expectation is for that to moderate? And then longer term over the next six quarters in conjunction with the $3 billion buyback, you mentioned, obviously, keeping capital for balance sheet side. So maybe if you could give us some thoughts around whether your plan is within that buyback expectation to continue to grow the balance sheet on a year-over-year basis and how that contrasts with the comments about trying to reduce the excess deposits on the balance sheet? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Brian, it\u2019s Eric. There are a couple of factors in there that both get at a total balance sheet and then the risk weighted asset content on the balance sheet I think as we distinguish those two. Let me just tackle your questions in order. On the NII range of $460 million to $470 million per quarter for the next couple of quarters, that fully takes into account some of our deposit management efforts. Remember, the incremental $10 billion deposit doesn\u2019t earn us a ton these days and so that\u2019s been factored in to that range. And the underlying reason in that range has slowed up a little bit as the front-end rates have ticked up, which was gratifying. In terms of balance sheet growth, we need to contain the size of the balance sheet in terms of size, call it, leverage assets, right? That\u2019s what we need to contain. Under the surface, there\u2019s always some amount of healthy growth in risk weighted assets, right, because as we support our clients in the FX business or in the sec lending business or by lending to them, we have to expand those modestly. Now on our balance sheet we are a capital-light business. We have got a -- we have RWAs on our balance sheet that are in the $120 billion range. What -- I don\u2019t know, there\u2019s a range of what those can grow, but they are not growing at 10% a year. They may be growing 5%-ish a year, plus/minus a couple of points and so it\u2019s kind of that level. And when you grow RWAs, that amount, you are not really adding to the leverage balance sheet. The leverage balance sheet, which connects with Tier 1 leverage is driven primarily with deposits and that\u2019s separable from the RWA kind of growth typically. Brian Bedell : Okay. Got it. That\u2019s clear. And then just maybe just back to the Abu Dhabi relationship, and as you said, Ron, you expect that to start moving pretty quickly. Should we think about any impact to AUC/A for State Street and asset servicing fees related to that or is it less material? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. Brian, I would say that our -- I mean, clear it would -- our expectations would drive AUC/A. I think it will be a modest amount at the beginning. It will also help us to continue to contain and manage our subcustody costs. And maybe most importantly, over the medium-term, given the relationships there, it will help further our penetration in the region. So, I mean, that\u2019s probably the most important reason to be doing it. They are just a terrific partner. Brian Bedell : Okay. Ron O'Hanley: The other thinking, the challenge that we often have and others have, too, is that there can be times when you have got subcustodians and you like them, but you are competing with them in certain instances. And in this case we have -- we now have a subcustodian that we are not competing with. Brian Bedell : Right. Right. That makes sense. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. Ron O'Hanley: Good morning. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start off, Eric, maybe with a question on securities growth. And more specifically, I guess, related, sorry, to the LCR. You had strong deposit growth, as you noted. The LCR ratio is running a ratio is running a little bit tight at 104% versus 100% minimum. I was hoping if you can just give us some sense philosophically, how you are managing to LCR constraints? And just given the poor QE, liquidity treatment of QE related deposit growth, how does it impact your ability to deploy at higher yields and even just grow the securities growth book incrementally from here? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Steve, it\u2019s Eric. The LCR has some anomalies. I will remind you of in the calculation between the all-in corp LCR and the bank. And the best way I can describe it is what\u2019s most pertinent to us as a institution, a bank holding company, is actually the bank LCR. The bank LCR is at 131%. So it\u2019s extremely flush and it\u2019s got plenty of room. What happens at the corp is that the additional deposits gets haircut just because of transferability, which is fine. And what happens in the calculation because of how the numerator is factored in for that and the denominator, I am happy to put you in touch with our IR team to share with you some of the scenarios is that, as we become more flush at the bank, which is a good thing, you have this odd result at the corporate holdco where the LCR goes down. What\u2019s ironic is that, if we were to begin to reduce deposits, what happens mathematically is that the bank LCR starts to flow down from this very elevated 131% and the corporate LCR actually floats up. And I think it\u2019s best to probably have, so when we work through the algebra with you, it\u2019s just how the rules are configured, they are fine. But we are actually quite flush with LCR and are operating quite comfortably. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that color, Eric. And the follow-up I had is just on expenses. You have done a great job\u2026 Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Steven Chubak : \u2026 of raising expense clearly in 2Q, the 3Q guide reinforces a similar trend, but there is some growing concern amongst investors, just given many of the other large banks are guiding higher on expenses talking about accelerating investments. I was hoping you might be able to give us some context on what the full year expense might look like for this year? And even talk thinking through what the growth algorithm might look like heading into next year, whether you might need to step up investments to keep up pace with peers ultimately. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Steve, let me start. Expense has been a focus for several years in a row now. We have gotten expenses down, ex-notables and adjusted for currency, down 2% and 1.5% last year, and this year, what we have said is that on a nominal basis, we expect expenses on a full year basis to be flattish, plus or minus 0.5 basis point range. And that\u2019s nominally and on an adjusted for currency basis and notables, it would be down by about a point, obviously, with a range around that. And obviously the biggest thing that we wrestle through this year, in particular, is that there are revenue related costs that come through, as we have mentioned, some custody costs are often AUC/A based, market data costs or AUC/A or AUM based. And so those are what we are working through and why we have a range there and we have stuck with our -- we have stuck and are sticking with that range given what we know today. I think the -- if I step back, the hallmark of our approach to cost is that you have got to systematically have productivity programs in place that actually save not a little bit, but save a good amount of cost, right? And I think we show you typically when we do our January call, at the beginning of the year that we are looking to take 4 percentage points or 5 percentage points of the expense base off through a set of productivity programs. We -- and that on a base of $8 billion, 4 point or 5 points is that\u2019s significant amounts. It\u2019s hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue, but we are a scale business. That\u2019s what we should be doing. And then at the same time, what we are doing is reinvesting a portion of that, not all of that, but a portion of that in the underlying business. And sometimes we invest by expanding coverage and sales forces. Sometimes, we reinvest by expanding and product feature functionality. Sometimes we invest as we onboard clients, right? We have some marginal cost that we have to have and we are usually happy to do that because it comes with revenues on the other side of it. And so our programmatic approach is to save sufficiently so that we can reinvest. And we will continue to do that. Now, how those balance out, we have given you a sense of how that balances out to down expenses in 2019 and 2020, it was down, and this year, we expect to be down as well, again, adjusted for notables and currency translation. How that plays out, we are going to keep working through. It\u2019s a little early to talk about next year. But I think you can tell we are pretty focused on this. But, obviously, we do need to factor in revenue related cost and as equity market continue to tick upwards, we have to factor that in and that\u2019s a little more of a feature this year and maybe even upcoming time periods than it has been and so that is something that we have to work through. But at least that\u2019s the broad approach. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great color, Eric. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Eric. Good morning, Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Gerard. Eric Aboaf : Hi. Gerard Cassidy : Eric, can you -- I think you said on the call and I am trying to get the transcript, I think, obtain it. So I apologize I have to ask this question. I think you said on the call that new business wins this quarter contributed positively. I think you said maybe earnings versus last quarter it was neutral. First of all, could you clarify if it was earnings? But second, what was the changing dynamics between the two quarters that enabled this quarter to be a positive number versus last quarter it was neutral? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it\u2019s Eric. The -- I think you have got the good memory and summary, and let me just add the specifics. As part of my prepared remarks on servicing fees, right? I was clear that part of the increase on a year-on-year basis in servicing fees came from positive net new business. So, more wins installed than the usual modest amount of attrition that we get. And that is in contrast, you remember correctly, last quarter, I said, new business -- net new business was neutral, and I said, we were not as pleased as we would like to be. We would like it to be positive and it\u2019s important for it to be positive. And part of what you are seeing is I think that, over the last couple of quarters, we have accelerated our wins and win rate. You see a little bit of that in AUC/As, but it\u2019s bouncy, right? You have seen us put in place an installed business quickly in some cases. So remember, custody can get installed quickly when it\u2019s won and so we have had some focus on some of those kinds of wins and those have come through. And the intention here is, how do you continue to sell and expand share of wallet with clients, not just with the top 60 as we have talked about, but the next 100 and the next 200. And so I think what we are starting to see is some of the effects of the or some of the results of that more intense coverage process, some of which we presented at one of the conferences back in June is starting to take root in a more, I will say, a more consistent way. That doesn\u2019t mean it will happen every quarter, but we are, I think, quite pleased with this quarter and we see that it\u2019s been building, it\u2019s been a building -- the momentum has been building in this regard. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Then the follow-up question is on the Alpha product and you are having, obviously, some success now in winning over new customers. I guess, within that area, what percentage of your pool of customers, you just referenced, Eric, the top 60, for example? What percentage of your customers are eligible -- you think would be interested in the Alpha product? And second, when you talk to your customers about taking on Alpha, what are some of the challenges you have found to convince them that it\u2019s really in their best interest to do it? Ron O'Hanley: Hey, Gerard. It\u2019s Ron. Why don\u2019t I take that? I mean, in theory, I suppose we would say, 100% of them are eligible. Starting point really matters here. The clients that have been -- we have now got experience under our belt, 15 through the end of the second quarter, a whole lot more current conversations underway. Typically, there\u2019s some kind of trigger point like an aging technology, ineffective or excessively costly operation stack that triggers this. The obstacles to it are several-fold, right? These are big change programs. And typically the institutions that are going forward with it, it\u2019s not about a deputy head of operations has decided to come hire us. It\u2019s almost always at least driven from the CIO and the COO, meaning the Chief Investment Officer and the Chief Operating Officer. And oftentimes, it\u2019s on the CEO\u2019s agenda. So when there\u2019s that kind of focus on it, that\u2019s when these things tend to happen. Now, just given what\u2019s going on and some of the trends in the asset management industry. I mean, the industry is buoyant now with some of the underlying trends in terms of aging technology, real challenges around data management and how do you effectively use the data. You have these issues are on the agenda of most CEOs. So it\u2019s very few instances where there\u2019s not a conversation going on. How it plays out will be different, which is why we built the model the way it is, meaning it\u2019s interoperability. We will -- we have had different wins where, in fact, we are interoperating with other front office systems to the extent we need to, such as Aladdin. And so we have tried to build this recognizing that these are very large sophisticated clients, long histories, lots of kind of software in their stacks and we want to make this work across a broad variety of clients. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Just as a quick follow-up on the share of wallet that you just referenced earlier, Eric. Have you guys found yet with the Alpha customers that you are having better success in expanding the share of wallet once you get them onboarded and up and running than a traditional customer? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Gerard, it\u2019s Eric. That\u2019s exactly the result that we are seeing, because what we are finding is not only, do we expand up and down the value chain, we had the front office, the middle office in many cases and the back office. But as you do that, it\u2019s much more natural to begin to, say, if you are going to add middle office and back office to begin to consolidate the custody, for example, in the relationship or to connect with the -- some of the trading activity that we have, because some of the trading activity can plug, for example, directly into Charles River. So that\u2019s the underlying benefit is the expanded share of wallet, so supplemented by these become even stickier relationships. These become true partnerships as opposed to a service arrangement. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Ron, you noted that you want to lean into the institutional asset management business and this quarter was one of the best flow quarters in five years. So can you, I guess, one, describe in more detail what you are doing on the sales and distribution side to drive the improved growth? And I guess, secondly, when you talk about adding products and capabilities, what areas would you look to add? Is that an organic effort or does that need to be acquisition, just some help on that? Thanks. Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. I mean, we -- what we have done is over the course of now a couple of years, taken a very good sales and relationship management force and made it better. We have the benefit in most of our instances because of the core passive products, where if we are in a client, we tend to be if not the largest manager, one of the largest, which by definition gives you a seat at their table as they think about asset allocation, those kinds of things. So it\u2019s been very systematically building out and upgrading our capability to have those conversations and provide those products and to have an increase share of their wallet. ESG has been providing some real tailwind here. We have got a long history in it. We have got a strong reputation in it and we have been able to both have those conversations and shape a lot of asset allocation there. In terms of products, I mean, it\u2019s -- if you think about it, it\u2019s -- we tend to dominate one end of the barbell. So as you look out across the rest of the barbell, almost anything would be eligible. Our focus is on now multi-asset products and building some of those ourselves or creating them bespoke from -- for very large clients through product capabilities that we already have. But the way we are thinking about it conceptually is that, we have a distinctive strength in terms of our institutional sales and client management capabilities and we are thinking about how to do that. We think there\u2019s an organic opportunity. In terms of inorganic, I mean, those -- they are hard to engineer, right? So if something comes along that makes sense for our clients and for our shareholders, we will certainly look at it. But there\u2019s been plenty of organic that we have been able to do that you are now seeing in the results. Jim Mitchell : All right. Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. In late 2018 you had around 40,000 employees, now you have 39,000 employees. So I was just wondering, you are putting on more revenues without adding headcount. To what role has technology played into that and what are your expectations going forward? And the big picture question is, what\u2019s the state of your tech backbone in terms of, how much are you in the cloud, public cloud, private cloud, how much do you expect to remain for almost a decade later, after State Street first implemented the cloud, it didn\u2019t go great last decade. It seems like it\u2019s going better now. So kind of an update on that, and again, tying that back to headcount? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. Mike, its Ron here. In terms of your point about the leverage we are getting out of the employee base, I\u2019d make a couple of points there. That the composition of that also has changed too. I mean we are continuing to leverage and utilize lower cost locations, so you would find that the mix has changed over that period. But you are raising actually the more important point, which is technology. And listen, service productivity and it\u2019s not just this service and it\u2019s not just this firm, service productivity has been elusive for a long time now. And I think we and I suspect others are getting our arms around it. A lot of it is automation, a lot of it is taking an automation and services, it\u2019s not the quite same thing as you envision, an automobile assembly line with lots of moving mechanical arms. It tends to be you are taking many, many tasks that constitute a job and automating those, such that what\u2019s remaining in the job is higher value-added and those things where you need judgment. We are getting better and better at instituting that. We also, Mike, and we have talked about this in other context, we are spending a lot of time on measuring productivity. Again, manufacturers, the good ones have had this down for a long time, service companies it\u2019s much newer. We have got a significant percentage for our company now that\u2019s covered by productivity metrics. And sometimes, it\u2019s -- the old Hawthorne effect, right? You just -- now that there\u2019s a measure and you are saying, hey, there\u2019s a difference between this group and that group, and they are pretty similarly situated and doing the same thing, what can we learn from that and that is starting to drive some of that productivity. On the technology side, I stand by the team that we have. It\u2019s an outstanding team. It\u2019s making a lot of progress. As you know, in technology, it\u2019s -- some of it is about pure investment in new stuff and new capabilities and that\u2019s part of the investment that we are making. A lot of it is around continuing to up our resilience. This is an ongoing issue for the industry, particularly in cyber as the cost to deal with that goes up and up and up. And as a G-SIB, we need to be at the lead and we want to be at the lead there. But I think we are making very good progress. It\u2019s showing up in the numbers. Again, it\u2019s the result, not just the things that we did last quarter, but the things that we have done now for many quarters and approaching years and they are starting to payoff and you will see more payoff in the future. Mike Mayo : And just -- I found that very interesting, the analogy you gave with the auto assembly line. So when you automate a services business, how much of that can you automate leaving the value-added parts at the end? And again, on the headcount question, maybe you don\u2019t want to answer that one or maybe you don\u2019t know yet, going ahead, but those two follow-ups, please? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. I mean, the -- you are asking the question and the first part of that next question you have asked, which is how far can we go? And we don\u2019t know that yet, but we know there\u2019s a lot more we can do than we have done. I mean to think about the striking of a NAV of a net asset value. I mean there\u2019s a lot that goes into that and then there\u2019s a lot of reconciliation and checking that goes into that. We are -- again as we have talked about in other forums, we are putting a lot of AI into that, right, to make that NAV calculation not be this flurry at the end of the day that begins at 4 :00 and hopefully is done by 5 :15. But in fact, it\u2019s starting as soon as trading starts such that what you are doing at the end is really that final checking where you do need human intervention. So, and Mike, what was your question on people? Did I miss a question or headcount? Mike Mayo : Yeah. Just -- no. Again, I was trying to make the connection between technology and headcount, and maybe I am forcing that connection. But your headcounts are flat. Your revenues look like they are going higher. You talked about backlogs, installation, intense, coverage process, do you expect headcount to start going up again given those initiatives and the backlog? Ron O'Hanley: I think what you should expect to see from us is a breaking of the relationship that occurred in the past, which is that headcount and compensation related costs went up kind of at the same level as revenue did. What this really is about is just getting more scale and scale effect out of our system. And in the past some of our challenge has been that we tend to deal with the most sophisticated clients highest demanding. They pay us a lot of money. So their demands are justified. But we have gotten much better about getting scale easing out of those relationships in those operations and you should expect us to continue to do that. Mike Mayo : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Rob. Rob Wildhack : Just another question on CRD, you guys did a nice job highlighting some of the drivers of this quarter\u2019s results. I am wondering if you could comment on the trajectory of the software enabled and professional services pieces. Do you think that the 10% growth that we saw this quarter is sustainable? Eric Aboaf : Rob, it\u2019s Eric. That certainly is sustainable. I think the, what we would actually like to do and you have seen in different quarters, if you go back to the last few earnings releases is that the combination of professional services and software enabled revenue is actually growing nicely in the double digits, it\u2019s not -- in some cases, closer to 15%. And because what\u2019s happening is two things. One is you have got take up in the market for new installations and I think we have described in the past, the number of SaaS clients, for example, is up. But you also have over time conversion from on-premise to SaaS, because clients are realizing the value of a cloud offering, a more standardized cloud offering. It still has to connect with their -- the rest of their estate, where they can then get upgrades and the new feature functionality that we roll out on a regular basis. So that\u2019s a -- that component of the professional services and software enabled set of revenues in Charles River, I think, are going to be in the mid -- in the double-digit teens typically. They will just bounce around a little bit with professional services. But that\u2019s a real -- that\u2019s -- I think that\u2019s the future of the franchise is in those areas. Ron O'Hanley: Rob, what I would add to that is, much of the investment that we have or one of the key investments we have put into CRD was, in fact, are enhancing, it\u2019s not overhauling the cloud offering. We have migrated that to the Microsoft Azure platform. It\u2019s now being installed in clients. It gives a whole -- a combination of more standardization. But as Eric noted, more flexibility for clients that have unique needs. And particularly, as you get outside the United States, there\u2019s very particular desires on where the data is located and Azure is giving us that ability to basically be flexible on that in terms of data location, which is -- should -- it\u2019s basically a more robust SaaS offering than Charles River had when we bought it. Rob Wildhack : Got it. And maybe relatedly, I did want to ask about profitability in CRD. Do you think that you are starting to see signs of scale in that business and then what do you think about the longer term profitability or margin profile of the business going forward? Eric Aboaf : Rob, it\u2019s Eric. Yeah. We are getting to that point. I think we bought Charles River three years ago as we said. We announced the deal and in the first year or two-year, we needed to reinvest in the platform. That was part of our deal modeling, was part of what we thought would lift revenue -- topline revenue from what was single digits into the low double digits on average we have said. And so we did need to reinvest last year of 2019, 2020 and this year. But I think we are starting to get to the point where it\u2019s got now the scale and the functionality it should have, where it can -- where we can really deliver earnings growth over time and take advantage of the momentum and take up that we have seen in this business. Ron O'Hanley: Rob, there\u2019s been two -- I\u2019d categorize the investments in Charles River in two broad categories. One is what you would have expected us to do for that matter, probably, any other buyer, which was, okay, we are going to enhance the offering here for Charles River and its historic established core business. The second category of investment has been related to the whole Alpha platform and making Charles River an integral part of that, enabling the kind of connectivity that Eric was talking about earlier connectivity to other parts of State Street connectivity, if you think about Charles River is the front to the middle and the back. And that\u2019s been -- there\u2019s been a lot of investment there and also a lot of development that\u2019s come out of that. I mean it\u2019s not like nothing has popped out, some of -- there\u2019s been quite a bit that\u2019s been completed and implemented. And we think we are kind of at -- that the peak of that and that, that should start to flatten and then decline. Rob Wildhack : Got it. Thank you, guys. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. A couple of questions for both of you, Ron and Eric. Firstly, Ron, you mentioned you have a wider -- you talked about the products in the asset management side, where does active stand and equity stand in your mind given that that has been stuck for the last four quarters. It hasn\u2019t really moved despite the strong markets? Is that still something you want to be in? Do you exit or what\u2019s your thinking there? I know it\u2019s small, so but given your comment about how you got a wide window? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. It\u2019s small and much of our active equity also tends to be in the value space, right, which is, Vivek, is not yet seen enduring day in the sun. But we do believe that active will play a part and should play a part in portfolios. We actually think that the move to active ETFs will help propel that. It will provide a different vehicle to construct portfolios with. So we view this institutional relationship management channel is one -- again, given the nature of the people and the nature of the relationships as one that can accommodate a broad set of products including active equity. Vivek Juneja : And would that really need an acquisition to sort of make a material impact on that or... Ron O'Hanley: Again, we are focused -- the organic agenda is pretty full in terms of products at this point and that\u2019s where our focus will be. I just hate to speculate about inorganic, because that\u2019s all it would be speculation. Again, to the extent to which something came along that made sense for our clients and for our shareholders, we would certainly take a close look at it. Vivek Juneja : And a completely separate question, if I may, the big win with someone like Invesco, huge existing client already. What is -- given that they are already a large client, what is the incremental services, and therefore, the incremental fee revenue from that, the $1 trillion sounds big, but how should we think about given that they are an existing client? Alpha, is that -- did you add middle office and front office, I mean, can you give us some perspective of how meaningful that kind of a win is? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. It is a large client. But we certainly -- we are not the only servicer of them. So I would think about the services there in a few buckets. Firstly, some back office, which actually transitioned over before we even announced the win -- additional back office. Secondly, is front office in terms of Charles River, which will be the core operating platform for them. And then, thirdly, middle office, as you noted. So it\u2019s really across the Board. And again, this is us partnering with them to help them achieve what they are trying to in terms of their technology and operation stack, because we do have a longstanding relationship with them. They have also partnered with us in terms of developing, helping us develop new features and functionality into the Alpha platform that will be extendable to other clients in the future. Vivek Juneja : And I guess the middle office would probably come a little bit longer time to get installs as it normally does? Ron O'Hanley: Right. Right. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you, both. Ron O'Hanley: Thanks. Operator : There are no other questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ron for closing remarks. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Operator, and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene and good morning everyone. Earlier this morning, we released our Q3 results, which reflect continued strong performance across our enterprise. Before I discuss our third quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge our employees for their ongoing achievements in supporting our clients and generating the performance and momentum we are now seeing across the franchise. Thanks to their hard work and execution, we are now seeing measurable progress in our financial results even as we invest in our business for the future. We continue to successfully execute against our strategic objective of being an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle, and back office and a leading asset manager. This is just the beginning. We are encouraged by the opportunities we see within our industry, our sales wins, the momentum in our pipeline, and what this means for our ability to drive future growth in 2022 and achieve our recently enhanced medium-term financial targets. We are encouraged by the trajectory of our organic profile as demonstrated by our year-to-date business wins. For example, on a year-to-date basis, we have delivered the strongest AUC/A wins in the company\u2019s history, while AUC/A 1, but not yet installed stood at $2.7 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors, our ETF franchise crossed $1 trillion of AUM this year with year-to-date SPDR flows on track for a record year and already surpassing the full year 2020 flows. Global Advisors financial performance continues to strengthen with pre-tax margin expanding to 36% in Q3. I also want to take a moment to note the intended acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services, which we announced in the third quarter. We are excited by the opportunities this transaction presents. It is a strong demonstration of our confidence in the industry, our investment servicing business, and our overall strategy. The transaction is also financially compelling as it will enhance State Street\u2019s financial profile, and importantly it will create long-term value for our shareholders. From a strategic perspective, this combination will strengthen our competitive positioning and market leadership and deepen geographic coverage with State Street becoming the number one provider of asset servicing globally by assets under custody. Further, the accompanying talent will build on State Street\u2019s already strong expertise and better position us for growth. The compelling nature of the deal has enabled us to raise our medium-term pre-tax margin targets. Turning to Slide 3, I will review our third quarter highlights. Third quarter EPS was $1.96, up 35% year-over-year. We delivered about 7 percentage points of positive operating leverage this quarter and generated a strong improvement in State Street\u2019s third quarter pre-tax margin, which increased by about 5 percentage points year-over-year to over 29%. This year-over-year improvement was driven by solid fee revenue growth, good organic results, and higher NII supported by robust loan growth, leading to a strong total revenue performance. Meanwhile, our focus on expense discipline continued to drive earnings growth as expenses remain well contained. Relative to the year ago period, quarterly total fee revenue increased 9% as we delivered broad-based improvement across all fee revenue lines. Servicing and management fees increased 7% and 10% year-over-year respectively, and we delivered solid results within our markets businesses despite a continued moderation of FX market volatility. Even with 9% year-over-year total fee revenue growth, expenses were well controlled, increasing just 1% over the same period. Though expenses were flat year-over-year, excluding notable items as our productivity improvements continued to yield results. AUC/A increased to a record $43.3 trillion at quarter end with new asset servicing wins increasing to $1.7 trillion for the quarter, including a large Alpha mandate with legal in general, which was announced in July. As a result, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed increased to $2.7 trillion at quarter end, as I noted a moment ago. Including the legal and general mandate, we reported three new Alpha client wins in the third quarter, making the total number of \u2013 taking the total number of Alpha clients to 18 at quarter end. At Charles River, annual recurring revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $239 million, and I am pleased with its business performance and how it continues to propel our Alpha strategy. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.9 trillion at quarter end and management fees increased to a record $526 million in the third quarter, benefiting from higher average equity market levels and continued inflows to our ETF franchise, where we continue to innovate. For example, in recent years, we have been expanding our actively managed ETF capabilities. And through three quarters this year, we have the most successful active ETF in the U.S. in terms of asset growth with the SPDR Blackstone senior loan ETF. By quarter end, this fund had gathered $5.5 billion inflows in 2021 and had AUM of $7.7 billion. We also made an addition to our actively managed fixed income ETF range in the third quarter for the launch of the SPDR Loomis sales opportunistic bond ETF. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, we completed a $1.9 billion common stock offering related to the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services in the third quarter. Also related to the transaction, we suspended common share repurchases in the third quarter and currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of next year. We increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets and we recognized its importance to our shareholders. We believe that the BBH Investor Services acquisition is a financially compelling use of our capital and that it will deliver earnings accretion and value creation for our shareholders over time. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. I will begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported GAAP EPS of $1.96 or $2 excluding the impact of notable items. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that we delivered strong revenue growth year-over-year across every line item, controlled expenses. We delivered significant pre-tax margin expansion, all of which drove strong earnings growth. In fact, expenses were down year-on-year, excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation, which you can see at the bottom of the slide. This was another strong quarter where we are able to demonstrate the progress we are making in delivering on both our strategic priorities and our medium-term targets. Turning to Slide 5, you will see our business volume growth. Period end, AUC/A increased 18% year-on-year to a record $43.3 trillion. The year-on-year increase was largely driven by higher market levels, net new business growth and client flows. At Global Advisors, AUM increased 23% year-on-year to $3.9 trillion. The year-on-year increase was primarily driven by higher market levels coupled with net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, both AUC/A and AUM were relatively flat given relatively stable domestic market levels. Turning to Slide 6, you can see another quarter of strong business momentum. Third quarter servicing fees increased 7% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, good client activity and flows, and positive net new business. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about 1 percentage point of impact from some divestiture activity. On a sequential basis, servicing fees were flat as favorable equity markets and client activity were offset by about a percentage point of currency translation from the U.S. dollar appreciation. AUC/A wins totaled roughly $1.7 trillion in the third quarter, which gets us to a record of over $3 trillion of new AUC/A wins year-to-date. We continue to estimate that we need at least $1.5 trillion in gross AUC/A wins annually in order to offset typical client attrition, normal pricing headwinds. And given the strong wins we have garnered year-to-date, we have already more than doubled that this year. At quarter end, AUC/A 1, but not yet installed amounted to $2.7 trillion. And I would also note that the unique Alpha value proposition represents a large proportion, which reflects our competitive strength as the only front to back office offering from a single provider. I will remind you that installations typically incur in phases and over time and deals will vary by fee and product mix. And as we have discussed previously, we would expect current one, but yet to be installed AUC/A to be converted over the coming 12 to 24-month time period with about half of the annualized revenue benefit through 2022 and about half in 2023. We continue to be pleased with our pipeline and our robust wins this quarter further showcases the broad-based geographic and multi-segment momentum of our business and will help drive net new business revenue growth in 2022. Turning to Slide 7, third quarter management fees reached a record $526 million, up 10% year-on-year and were up 4% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in a record investment management pre-tax margin of about 36%. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF flows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by the impact of the previously reported idiosyncratic institutional client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers. Notably, we previously estimated that gross money market fee waivers on our management fees could be approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter. As a result of the recent improvement in short-end rates, we now expect they will be modestly lower at around $20 million in the fourth quarter, assuming current forward rates. Lastly, as you will recall, we have taken a number of actions to deliver growth in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises and we continue to have strong momentum and year-to-date results as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. Turning to Slide 8, let me discuss the other important revenue \u2013 fee revenue lines in more detail. Within FX trading services, we are pleased that we continue to generate strong client volumes, which remained above pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter. Relative to the third quarter of 2020, FX revenue increased 3% year-on-year, reflecting higher direct sales and trading revenue and indirect volumes, partially offset by lower FX volatility. FX revenue was down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower client volumes and spreads. Moving to securities finance, third quarter fees increased 26% year-on-year mainly reflecting higher client securities loan balances and spreads as well as business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, third quarter software and processing fees increased 15% year-on-year, but were 8% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by CRD, which I will turn to next. Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019d like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, with a year-on-year revenue growth of 22%. We saw growth across all three categories of CRD revenues, on-premise, professional services and software enabled. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continued to grow nicely and were up 18% year-on-year. Record new quarterly bookings of $28 million and a healthy revenue backlog of $105 million also demonstrate the continued business momentum that we are seeing in CRD supported by the Alpha value proposition. On the bottom right of the slide, we show some of the third quarter highlights from our State Street Alpha mandates. We reported 3 new Alpha mandates during the third quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate well with clients. Notably, since inception, through third quarter, we now have 7 of 18 total Alpha client mandates that are live. As a testament to our ongoing commitment and investment to further building out our Alpha value proposition, we have also acquired Mercatus, a premier front and middle office solutions and data management provider for private market managers. In connection with the acquisition, we launched Alpha for private markets, which will extend our end-to-end data platform offering for alternatives. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII increased 2% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher loan balances, growth in the investment portfolio and more deposits as well as the absence of the previously disclosed third quarter \u201820 true-up partially offset by lower investment portfolio yields due to the low rate environment. Relative to the second quarter, NII came in 4% higher primarily as a result of higher loan balances and a larger investment portfolio as well as higher short-term rates, all of which was partially offset by ongoing compression of yields. I would also note that we saw larger than usual slowdown in premium amortization in the quarter due to some tactical rotation of the MBS portfolio, which accounted for about a third of the sequential quarter improvement and something we wouldn\u2019t expect to repeat in the fourth quarter. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. Notably, total average deposits decreased by $9 billion in the third quarter or a decrease of roughly 4% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the active management of non-operational deposits. We also put more of our surplus balance sheet cash to work. We added approximately $3 billion quarter-on-quarter to our investment portfolio. We also increased our average loan balances quarter-on-quarter to $32 billion in response to the good client demand. Turning to Slide 11, third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were flat year-over-year as productivity savings for the quarter continue to more than offset targeted business investments, typical expense headwinds, and $10 million to $20 million of higher than expected revenue-related quarterly costs. Compared to the third quarter of last year on a line item basis, excluding notables, compensation employee benefits was down 1%, driven by higher salary deferrals and lower headcount, partially offset by higher medical benefit cost as claims begin to normalize. Information Systems and Communications were up 3% due to continued investment in infrastructure and our technology estate, partially offset by our savings programs. Transaction processing was up 8%, primarily driven by higher revenue-related expenses associated with sub-custody volumes and market data costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting benefits from our footprint optimization efforts. And other expenses were down 5%, primarily driven by lower asset management sub-advisory fees and the timing of some marketing costs. Relative to the second quarter, expenses excluding notable items were down primarily driven by the currency translation of the strong dollar and lower headcount. Overall, we are pleased with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline while driving high single-digit fee revenue growth year-over-year. When combined together, we delivered a solid pre-tax margin of nearly 30% and generated a robust operating leverage of about 7 percentage points year-over-year. Moving to Slide 12, on the right of the slide, we show our capital highlights. As Ron mentioned earlier, to finance our proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services business, we completed a $1.9 billion common offering this quarter. Also in conjunction with the transaction, we did not repurchase any stock during the third quarter and intend to temporarily suspend repurchases before resuming them during the second quarter of 2022. Lastly, we still increased our quarterly dividend by 10% and returned a total of $179 million to shareholders in the third quarter in the form of dividends paid. To the left of this slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of the third quarter, our standardized CET1 ratio improved by roughly 230 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 13.5%. The improvement was primarily driven by the issuance of $1.9 billion of common stock related to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Investment Services and higher retained earnings. We also managed down our RWAs. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio also improved quarter-on-quarter by a little over 100 basis points to 6.3%, primarily driven by the issuance of the common stock, a decrease in the balance sheet size as we actively reduced some excess deposits and higher retained earnings. Post closing of the Brown Brothers Investment Services acquisition, we expect both capital ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges. Turning to Slide 13, in summary, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates continued business momentum on our top line and productivity and engineering across our operating model. Total fee revenue was up 9% year-over-year, continuing the momentum we saw last quarter, reflecting growth in all businesses with management fees reaching a record level this quarter. Our expenses remained effectively flat excluding the impact of notable items as a result of our productivity efforts, notwithstanding higher revenue related costs mentioned earlier. As a result, we delivered about 7 percentage points of operating leverage year-on-year and we are able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets even in this low rate environment. Next, I\u2019d like to update our outlook. With just one quarter left in the year, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the full year outlook. At a macro level, our rate outlook broadly aligns to the current forward rate curve. We are also assuming global equity market levels will be flat to the third quarter average for the rest of the year as well as continued normalization of FX market volatility. In terms of the full year outlook, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 5% year-over-year, with servicing fees expected to be up 7.5% to 8.5% year-over-year. You will recall that at the beginning of the year, our guide was for total fee revenue to be flat to up 2%. So, this continues to be a meaningful increase over our earlier expectations. We increased this due to both higher equity markets and our net new business performance. Regarding NII, we had a small rebound in the short end market rates and some movement in the longer end of the curve as well. We now expect NII in the range of $475 million to $490 million next quarter, which is a meaningful improvement from the range we provided last quarter. This assumes rates do not deteriorate and premium amortization continues to trend favorably though as I mentioned earlier, we would not expect the same episodic slowdown in amortization that we saw in the third quarter to repeat in 4Q. Turning to expenses, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage core operating costs, while on-boarding new clients and investing in the business. Given the strong revenue performance this year and a healthy pipeline in front of us, we now see the need to both invest in our staff and in our business as well as covering some revenue-related costs. We thus expect full year expenses ex-notables to be up 1% to 1.25% year-over-year, which means a sequentially quarter increase into the fourth quarter. This is the equivalent of full year expenses being flat adjusted for the currency translation headwind and this would put us in a position to drive solid full year margin expansion and operating leverage in spite of the double-digit year-on-year decline in NII. On taxes, we now expect that full year 2021 tax rate will be towards the lower end of our range of 17% to 19%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Eric. To conclude our prepared remarks, we had a strong third quarter and continued to demonstrate measurable progress towards achieving our medium-term financial targets, including our recently increased pre-tax margin target. As we look ahead, we need to both appropriately recognize staff for a strong year and proactively invest in our business as we see growth accelerate. These strategic investments will include the Alpha platform and private markets expansion in particular as well as State Street Digital to drive future growth. As we stand here today and make these business investments for the next stage of growth, we have confidence that we will be able to do so while also delivering positive operating leverage and expanding our pre-tax margin each year through our medium-term horizon aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses. With that, operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe we can start with a question around asset management. I am not sure if you can answer, but I will give it a shot. So, we obviously continue to see market speculation surrounding strategic alternatives to SSGA. We have seen that in the past as well. Ron, you have been very vocal about sort of the secular changes in the asset management industry that are sort of supporting your growth strategy on the servicing fee side and a lot of that has just emphasized the scale. So, I guess with that in mind, do you think SSGA has enough scale to succeed in the marketplace today? And if there are sort of strategic alternatives that you are considering, do you need to remain a majority shareholder of any asset management kind of entity or if minority or a GB structure would make more sense, are the capital rules just too onerous and the obstacles too high to ultimately get anything done here? Eric Aboaf : Well Alex, thanks and you have said a mouthful there. The \u2013 I mean I will begin this by saying that we like the business, and we particularly like our business. It is continued \u2013 its performance has continued to improve, and it\u2019s now at least at average, if not above average in terms of the market and continues to grow in what are secularly growing areas, if you think about the ETF business, particularly fixed income ETFs etcetera. So, we think the business is \u2013 it\u2019s an attractive business. It\u2019s a business that helps us strategically from a portfolio perspective; and for many years now, it\u2019s been a bit of a laboratory for us to test out different things that gives us an insight into the rest of the marketplace. So, our overriding goal would be to continue to participate in the business assuming that we continue to believe that we can improve performance. I am not going to comment on speculation other than say that it\u2019s speculation. And if we have something to talk about, we will certainly come to you. Alex Blostein : Got it. Fair enough. Eric, maybe one follow-up for you, just on the servicing fee side, obviously, a really nice momentum in terms of wins, but servicing fees are flattish quarter-over-quarter and even taking into account some of the [indiscernible]. So it sounds like a lot of it is just timing with next kind of 12 to 24 months. Hopefully, we will see the benefit of the revenues on the yet to be installed business. Can you help us frame and sort of size the revenue pool attached to the $2.7 trillion on yet to be installed? And then within that, maybe hit on the pricing dynamics as well. I think in your comments, you said the \u2013 you continue to see kind of normal pricing headwinds in the business. I think it\u2019s been kind of in the 2% to 3% range long-term. Is that sort of the headwind we are still talking about or has that changed? Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Alex, let me \u2013 thanks for the question. Let me answer them maybe in reverse order. I think we continue to see the normalized pricing headwinds in the marketplace. We feel they are well controlled. We feel like they are understandable. They are logical. And that headwind is back down to about 2%, which is the historical norm. And a lot of that is how we go to market, how we engage with clients, how we now have added more feature functionality to our offering, Alpha is a big part of that of course and the duration of some of these deals will, I think, help reinforce that over time. We are very pleased, I think as you could expect with the wins this quarter, last quarter or the first quarter for that matter, and they are certainly in the range of the fee rates that we have for the company. We don\u2019t \u2013 I think we don\u2019t feel comfortable going into individual deals or individual quarters on that, but they are in that range that you see \u2013 that you broadly see on average and that gives us confidence that as this business get installed, it\u2019s going to have a meaningful impact to revenues. We have been clear. We need about $1.5 trillion plus of AUC/A wins. We need that at current or around the fee rates that we have create the right amount of gross revenue wins as well, which then get implemented over time. So, that\u2019s why we have put that benchmark out there. And what I would say is, while I think we have had until this year, a couple of lighter years in terms of sales, we need to continue the momentum we have been building. And part of the reason we referenced the pipeline is we feel comfortable with the pipeline and we see maybe not another $3.2 trillion of AUC/A wins, but at least substantial wins embedded in the pipeline for us to continue this momentum into next year. Alex Blostein : Great. Appreciate all of that. Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Mr. Hawken, your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019d like to start maybe with BBH, could you talk about what you would expect the impact of that acquisition could do to your asset sensitivity and how the inclusion or pro forma balance sheet would be sensitive to a 100-basis-point shift in rates? And then also to help contextualize investors, Eric, you had discussed on the M&A call that the cost savings assumption is conservative, what\u2019s a historical range for the right way to think about expenses for these types of deals? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Let me start on the deposit side and then we will leg into the other part of the P&L. And obviously, it\u2019s early with Brown Brothers Investment Services. We are now \u2013 we have now gotten our regulatory filings in. We are obviously working through the closing process and with \u2013 are continuing to target a year end close. In terms of asset sensitivity, I think it\u2019s a little early to model it too finely, but I think I would say is that the asset sensitivity of the book is probably in the range of what we have at State Street just because it\u2019s similar asset management-oriented clients. They have similar expectations of deposits and deposit pricing, and I think you get similar betas and well similar betas and adjustments overall. I think what\u2019s different, Brennan, and constructive here is because of the Brown Brothers bank sweep program, we have more flexibility than usual to either bring in deposits at attractive rates. And so that could, in a way, enhance our asset sensitivity though you have to be careful by the \u2013 you have to model that in or it could let us protect the size of the balance sheet and the leverage constraint \u2013 leverage ratio constraints that we have, which also led us adjust the amount of preferred securities that we need to run the business. So, I would say, overall, it\u2019s probably in the same ballpark but with an ability through the rate cycle to either add deposits and NII or to manage leverage, and I think that\u2019s a constructive program and a new functionality that they bring to us and one that will continue. In terms of the expense guide, I did say I was hopeful it\u2019d be a bit on the conservative side. I think the expense guide was for a reduction of about 25%. So kind of, I think, on the lower end of what we\u2019ve achieved before. I think \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to compare to past deals to, I guess, too forcefully because every deal is different. We need to bring this business on, and I\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019ve not always finished what we started and made sure that all the integration happens and all the functionality that we bring in from an acquisition gets fully integrated and created in our own offering. And I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s been at the lower end of our expense savings targets. But I think there is \u2013 we will see. I think it\u2019s early. I think we will be \u2013 we will certainly give guidance as to some of those cost estimates in January, and we will certainly keep you posted. But we stand by the guidance. And as the see if I\u2019m hopeful we can \u2013 we certainly want to meet those. And I always like to exceed where I can, but I think it\u2019s a little early to lean too far. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Hey, Brennan, it\u2019s Ron. What I would just add to that is we\u2019ve emphasized about this acquisition. It is about capabilities and geographic reach and talent. So as we think about the synergies here, we\u2019re thinking about them as combined synergies, if you will. I mean there is instances, where there is just some better capabilities that exist over at Brown Brothers. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for all that color. And then for my second question, Ron, actually, Eric, when you provided the color on the fourth quarter expense expectation you made reference to some needs to invest and whatnot. I know it\u2019s probably early. You\u2019re probably just starting to work on the budget for 2022. But cost inflation is very much on the minds of investors. We hear about it broadly. One of your competitors at a recent conference raised the point that there would probably be some upward expense pressure in 2022. Should we begin to prepare for a bit of a lift? Is it appropriate maybe to use the fourth quarter as the jumping off point and then adjust for seasonality and then think about that into next year? Is there just some general guiding principles you could provide to help people level set on \u201822? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Brennan, let me start on that, okay? Because we are definitely seeing instances where there is some cost pressure, but it\u2019d be untrue to say that it\u2019s across the board. Certain types of employees for example, in the technology area, as you\u2019d expect, because there, we\u2019re not just competing with other customer banks, we\u2019re competing with technology firms. So we are definitely seeing that. But we also continue to see productivity improvements in our business. We\u2019re engineering them in. So we do see an ability to offset some, if not all that. And we\u2019re just going to be careful about how we proceed forward. We don\u2019t want to underinvest in key staff. But we also think that \u2013 I mean, as we see performance, we can pay for performance and do it through the incentive line. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re watching out for. And there are particular areas where we are seeing the need to raise the fixed cost of talent, but not at an overwhelming \u2013 we\u2019re not seeing an overwhelming kind of thing yet. Eric, you probably want to add something. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Brennan, I\u2019d add to that, you go through the line items of expenses. Ron covered the salary comp incentives. And obviously, we have a little pressure there, but we also have a little more attrition. I think everyone seen that as they \u2013 so we\u2019re trying to \u2013 we need to net that out as we go into next year. I think you see a little bit of creep on the tech side. Obviously, some of those cost and transactional costs. But again, we have our engineering programs to offset some of that. And while it means there is more work to do. There is always more work to do. That\u2019s just how it plays out. I think from a \u2013 if you step back and you say what are the guiding principles that we use as we go into our budget process, which is just really started and full swing in November and then comes through in December. Is really about how do we continue to make healthy or solid progress in expanding margin each year? How do we do that with a positive operating leverage? And you\u2019ve heard me say before, we don\u2019t like to live on the edge and be too hopeful of an equity market tailwind or something of that sort. And so I think you\u2019ve got to think of it as commitment to progressing towards our medium-term targets and progressing at pace where we can make a progress each year. You\u2019ve seen us notwithstanding the interest rate headwinds this year. We\u2019re making progress this year towards those targets. We\u2019re proud of that, and we need to feel like we need to continue that. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for all that color. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So two questions. One, I think on the expense side, one of the reasons why there are so many questions here is that there had been a period where State Street had a tougher time delivering positive operating leverage. And then more recently, you\u2019ve had very good success. So when I hear the point about, hey, we\u2019re going to be reinvesting a bit for future growth. I\u2019m just wondering, is this a message we should take that the investment spend was a bit under \u2013 you underinvested over the past 1.5 years and now we\u2019re going to ramp back up to \"normal\"? Or is this more of a temporary, we\u2019ve got some things specific opportunities that we need to invest in. We can\u2019t tell you how many quarters it\u2019s going to take, but it\u2019s more of a specific opportunity and the positive operating leverage we\u2019ve been used to seeing recently will persist once we get through this period? I guess that\u2019s part of the reason why there is so many questions on expenses. And if we could frame it like that, would there be any more color you could share with us. Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Betsy, it\u2019s Ron. So we\u2019ve been \u2013 we certainly have not been underinvesting in our business. And whether it\u2019s inorganic or organic. I mean, obviously, as Charles River, more recently, Brown Brothers on an inorganic basis. But as we\u2019ve tried to emphasize quarter-over-quarter, every time we\u2019ve talked about us keeping expenses flat or even down. That\u2019s been done by a fairly aggressive engineering effort to bring down BAU expenses, while also continuing to invest in the business particularly in the technology area. In terms of future investments, we just see the momentum building in areas where we\u2019ve already started to invest and there is opportunity to invest more and accelerate growth. And the three areas that we highlighted were : one, just continuing to invest in Alpha and kind of bring more and more of that to market quicker. Second is private markets. And then third is the whole digital space where you\u2019re seeing a lot of activity there, and that\u2019s a combination of both supporting our clients in their digital kinds of ventures and also continuing to go to the next stage of digitization of our own business. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about there. And again, I would underscore what I said at the end of my prepared remarks that we will do so with a commitment to positive operating leverage and continued margin expansion over the short to medium term. Betsy Graseck : That\u2019s great color. And those three threads, those are top of our list too in terms of revenue generating growth potential over the next 3 to 5 years. So that seems like it makes a lot of sense to be investing for that. Maybe a little bit more quarterly-oriented kind of question. But just on the loan growth that you saw in the quarter, I just want to get a sense as to key drivers of that growth? And should we think that it was specific to this quarter? Or there is a demand there that we will likely see that kind of growth continue as we look into next year? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. It\u2019s a little bit of both, actually. We saw higher than usual opportunities this quarter. I think sequentially, our loan balances were up. They are talking $3 billion. That\u2019s quite a bit on a $30 billion base of loans. We \u2013 a little bit of that was some discretionary lending we do, and then some of it was literally higher demand from private equity capital call financing, obviously, as the alternatives market continues to boom, some of our classic fund finance clients. We\u2019re looking for some support and so forth. So I think it was a higher than usual quarterly print. I think year-on-year, what we\u2019re seeing is some confidence that we can grow this loan book in the low double digits, which is nice. The one thing we are conscious of, though, is with loans comes RWA. And so what we\u2019re always doing in background is optimizing the risk-weighted asset and the returns mix of those loans to make sure that in some cases, we add. In other cases, we sell fund by optimizing other positions, and that will be part of how we think about it going forward. But we do think of lending as an opportunity for us to drive NII in the coming quarters and years. Betsy Graseck : Thanks, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Good afternoon. I wonder if you could expand on the NII discussion. Just talk about what you think are non-operating excess deposits right now and how you think they behave as you have the model them behaving in a modestly rising world as we go into next year. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes, Glenn, it\u2019s a really good and hard question, because there is not an easy answer to them. I think we clearly have, like others have had some amount of excess deposits flow in. What I would say, though, is if you go back, call it, 2 years, you can ask the question, is that the typical deposits and is all the increased excess. And I\u2019d say that\u2019s not true. What we\u2019ve had over the last 2 years is very significant growth in our AUC/As. And with AUC/As, right, clients need to leave a certain amount of cash with us to handle the transaction volumes. And so a good bit of the increase that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is on the core deposit side. There is so some, as you\u2019ve seen, that is excess. And we pulled off, I think, a reasonable amount this quarter. We don\u2019t necessarily want to push down deposits too far because we do want to be there for our clients. If you go from \u2013 with that context to the, I think, the next part of your question, which is what happens in either tighter monetary policy with a slower expansion of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet or rising rates. Does that reverse the course of deposits? I think it will eventually, but I think it will be a while. It will be a 2 to 3-year process reason for that to happen. And part of the reason I say that is the Fed continues even under a tapering to expand its balance sheet, right? They are just expanding it less is what the talk is all about. It\u2019s not about actually stopping the expansion of its balance sheet. And so as the Fed continues to expand its balance sheet and then signal rising rates, I think we\u2019re probably going to be in an environment of having healthy deposit levels, which effectively mean they are core, right, partly driven by the AUC/A need and partly driven by just the surplus of cash in the system and rising rates, which I think would be a positive \u2013 would be positive to certainly our balance sheet and NII and to the other banks as well. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. I wonder if you could just expand a little bit more on your thoughts. You mentioned private markets is one of the key growth areas. You\u2019re one of the pioneers on the custody side of that. What does Mercatus do for you? And what can and can\u2019t you do right now for the expanding world of private market? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes. And private markets is a broad area, which is why I think we see some opportunities. If you recall, there is hedge fund activity in private markets. There is classic private equity. There is more fixed income kind of loan-oriented private markets. There is real estate. And so it\u2019s in each of those areas where there is not one investment we need to make, but a series as we pick our spots and pick our spots not only across each of those products, but make some choices geographically as well. What Mercatus brings is a set of front-end functionality to the \u2013 that we can use to support our private other private market clients, so functionality around reporting to LPs, reporting to their own partnership. And that\u2019s the front end that I think we value. And with that comes a set of data feeds and communication that\u2019s quite valuable. And if you think about that, that is directly plugs into the historical custodial operation that we provide and why we\u2019re so excited about it. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Hey, Glenn, what I would add to this that, that market is still largely an in-sourced market. So this isn\u2019t about slugging it out with competitors and a race to the bottom on fees, that\u2019s to be able to demonstrate a better offering than what these institutions are doing for themselves. The stakes are going up for them in terms of data reporting, particularly in ESG reporting. It\u2019s not just that investors are demanding it, but in some cases, particularly outside the U.S. and Europe, you\u2019re seeing reporting requirements being imposed not just on public companies but on private companies. And investors want to know what\u2019s in their portfolio, including their private portfolio. So we think this is all going to be \u2013 and Mercatus helps us do that and this will all be further impetus to drive this to a more outsourced model. Glenn Schorr : Thank you for all that. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Eric, I just want a couple of cleanups here. So you said that the premium was improved, but you called it episodic, but just wanted to make understand like what was that premium number in the third quarter so we can understand. I think you said it would continue to improve. So I just want to understand what the delta was this quarter. Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think the best way to describe it, Ken, is remember, every quarter, we get some headwind from the compression in underlying yields in the portfolio. And what offsets that is less and less premium amortization, which comes through as a negative, but it\u2019s a smaller negative each quarter. And this past quarter, I said about third of the $20 million improvement was from, I\u2019ll describe as an excess reduction in premium amortization. And that\u2019s the piece we don\u2019t expect to repeat. We do, as I said, continue to expect some marginal headwinds in the underlying portfolio yields. We do expect some ongoing reduction in premium amortization, not just at that same level. And then we\u2019ve also been pleased with some of what we\u2019ve been able to do on the balance sheet asset size around lending and the investment portfolio. And that\u2019s why we took our range up. But we\u2019re a little conscious that the fourth quarter print we gave a range purposely. We don\u2019t think the third quarter prints necessarily a perfect indicator of that. But all that said, I think we\u2019re pleased with the direction that NII has taken over the last couple of quarters, and we think that sets us up for the future as well. Ken Usdin : So do you have a number to give us versus the 157 in the second quarter? Eric Aboaf : I think you\u2019ll have to help me. I think in the second quarter, we had NII of 467 in the third quarter for 87. And I think the range I gave you was 475 to 490 for fourth quarter. That\u2019s total NOI. I think what I\u2019m trying to message is there are pieces below the surface, and we could get into a great amount of detail, but that\u2019s kind of where the next falls out. Ken Usdin : Okay. So on money market fee waivers, can you tell us what the money market fee waivers and asset management were in the third quarter? Eric Aboaf : Sure. In the third quarter, the money market fee waivers were about $19 million. Back in the second quarter, they were close to $25 million. And that\u2019s why we thought at current levels of front-end rates, which have stabilized, we said that fourth quarter is likely to be around the $19 million, $20 million that we just saw. Ken Usdin : And what about the other fee waivers that were $21 million in the second quarter, do you have what that was in the third? Eric Aboaf : I think we are focused \u2013 the biggest driver of money market fee waivers in our systems for GA, for our Global Advisors business, that\u2019s the one we have spent the most time tracking I think is material. I think the \u2013 and dominates. So I think that\u2019s the area to focus on. Ken Usdin : Okay. Thanks a lot, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Hi, great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. First one is just on the asset servicing side, Eric, if you can maybe just sort of maybe give us a view on that step-up of asset servicing fee growth at legacy State Street, not including Brown Brothers in \u201822 and \u201823, given that the new wins have been so strong and you\u2019re running at more than double the pace required to offset the pricing headwinds. So I mean, I guess the short question here is, should we expect a step-up in organic growth of asset servicing in \u201822 and again in 2023 given that pipeline? And not factoring in any kind of ignoring the market side of it. Eric Aboaf : Brian, it\u2019s Eric. I think it\u2019s a little early to get out and start to forecast \u201822 and \u201823. I think what I was trying to signal is we\u2019re very pleased with our sales performance this year. We\u2019ve been able to book, and that clearly is going to be part of the components of delivering growth in \u201822 and \u201823. I would say we \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this before, we need to earn our keep every quarter by continuing to drive sales and wins. And you saw that in the first quarter, we had $343 million of AUC/A wins. We\u2019re very pleased with that. We\u2019re pleased again with the second quarter with the third quarter. We need to keep at it because if you step back, remember, a portion of every year\u2019s wins gets implemented in that particular year. It\u2019s something like a third. About two-thirds of a year\u2019s wins typically is \u2013 gets reported in the following calendar year. And then you still have some, it\u2019s probably like a six in the year after that. So we are in a business where what we saw, we then start to implement and then we need to keep up that progress, and that\u2019s what drives growth. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re on a good trajectory. We\u2019re pleased with this year\u2019s successes and we\u2019d like to continue to be successful. We expect to be given our pipeline, but it\u2019s still early to forecast actual growth for next year and the year after. Brian Bedell : Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then, Ron, just back on SSGA, obviously, you made a good case for the growth in that business longer term. But as you just think of strategically State Street as a whole, obviously, you\u2019ve been the clear and away leader in the core asset servicing business. And your \u2013 you continue to enhance that lead with CRD and BBH and other investments for organically growing it. So as you think about State Street longer term, maybe would you prefer to be more of a pure-play on that leadership position or would you prefer to have the balance of the asset management business within that? And I guess also, is it really critical that you need SSGA for preferential capital treatment for going through the Fed\u2019s stress test and CCAR? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, Brian, I mean, if you think about our portfolio of businesses, we are far and away the narrowest of both the U.S. and the total G-SIFI population. So we are pretty focused to begin with. And if you think about those two broad businesses, because I would put markets underneath our investment servicing business, because it\u2019s really there to support that business, so if you think about those two businesses, they really are \u2013 they fall under that single purpose of helping institutional investors achieve better outcomes. So we start out from a position of being very focused. And then we ask ourselves all the time. First, are we satisfied with our performance and second, are we the right owner for these businesses? And at this point, as we look at it, we think and believe that given the performance, given the somewhat symbiotic relationship between two businesses that having this participation in that business is actually enhancing. And as you note, it\u2019s certainly is helpful from a capital perspective and relative to our investment servicing and related activities, it\u2019s a capital-light business. So when you add it all together, we like the business, but we recognize that you as shareholders can take care of diversification, and it\u2019s not up to us to diversify for you. We have to make sure that as owners of these businesses that we\u2019re good owners, and we can continue to grow the business, and we are looking at this all the time. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just on the security servicing side, outside of one-off large outflows like the BlackRock is. Can you speak to your efforts to reduced client attrition and kind of get that $1.5 trillion bogey of annual gross outflows down to really start to enhance the net growth from that side of the equation? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it\u2019s Eric. Let me start. There is a long history here in serving our clients, serving them well and being incredibly focused on what they need. And that\u2019s what both create sales and sales opportunity because we\u2019ve said over time, something like two-thirds, three-quarter of our sales come from our existing clients. And the other side of that coin is staying close to our clients when they are spending their needs, being there when they add funds or when they consider other options, is also a big part of what we do. Now sometimes our clients are involved in M&A, and we need to rebid what we\u2019ve got. And so we have very active programs when that happens. And that\u2019s part of the industry. We\u2019ve got a set of client NPS, Net Promoter Score work that we do, that we\u2019ve expanded over the last 2 years to now take on a very large portion of our clients. So that provides real-time feedback to us from the C-suite on down to the operational portions of our clients. And then it\u2019s our coverage program. I think you saw us back in June describe how do you bridge with our Global Client division, our premium, our preferred and each one of them is geared towards making sure that we\u2019re staying close and supporting our clients and making sure they are as satisfied and as can be. So, those are some of the elements, and I would say it\u2019s deep in our culture and something we work on. That said, you have got to keep \u2013 if we want to grow and deliver core growth like we have done in the last few quarters, we have been able to drive core growth, which we are very pleased with. We have got to keep expanding and selling both to existing and to new clients. And you have seen us do that successfully. And then on the other side, we \u2013 I think we feel quite good about our retention rates and that will be \u2013 that\u2019s always an area of intense effort and I would say this year has been successful as well. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just the second question on enhanced custody. If I look at the balance \u2013 if I am reading the balance sheet correctly, it seems like you have had very significant growth there. Is there any constraints on growing that business from a balance sheet perspective, capital perspective? How do we think about the \u2013 what\u2019s driving the growth and the outlook for that over the next year or 2 years? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Jim, it\u2019s Eric again. I think for all of our balance sheet businesses, we always need to be careful about how much they consume in risk-weighted assets versus the earnings and the opportunities that they could provide us. We do that certainly on a standalone basis because you have got to look at every asset on the balance sheet, whether it\u2019s lending asset for our loan book, for example, or securities finance business or enhanced custody business or FX business. And then you also have to think about it within the context of the client relationship because there is always a give and take and for a client that may not borrow very much, where they did do more securities finance for enhanced custody, that can be a reasonable mix and a way to serve them, but to serve them with decent returns. So, I would say there is certainly room in these businesses, but I think what we are doing is going into the end of the year as we close the Brown Brothers acquisition, we are being a bit disciplined about our risk-weighted asset position, right, because we want to close that deal, and we want to land within our capital ratios. And so I think while you have seen some very heavy growth in the last couple of quarters, just in the next one quarter to two quarters, I think you will see \u2013 you will continue to see some discipline. You have seen a little bit of that on the quarter-on-quarter balance sheet in some of the areas like securities finance. And you can imagine we will do that going into the beginning of next year. But what I would say is I think the franchise as we continue to grow the fee portion of the revenue base, manage our expenses, we can continue to put more capital to work over time, but sometimes there will be some ebbs and flows. And I think I have given you a little bit of an indication where we see some of those. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So Eric, I wanted to start off just discussing some comments you made actually a bit ago at the BAB conference. You talked about the servicing fee growth algorithm and you framed it based on expectations around new store and same-store sales growth, pricing pressures, what have you. And I was hoping you can maybe just update us on how your thinking has evolved with regard to that algorithm, whether it\u2019s strengthened just given the improved outcomes that we are seeing in terms of new business wins, at least relative to what you have seen historically? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Steve, I think the algorithm that you are referring to that we have \u2013 that I have described and we have described as a company is that servicing fee growth comes from a mix of equity market tailwinds, client activity inflows, net new business, we can either be positive as it has been the last couple of quarters, neutral or negative and then pricing headwinds, right. It\u2019s that four-part structure. I think the way I would update that is to say that the structure is still there and I think been fortified. I think the different areas move around a bit. I think equity market tailwinds, we have seen a very strong equity market tailwinds this year. I don\u2019t think we are going to see that every year, but we would like to see flat to up equity market. So, you can imagine that part of the tailwind was very positive this year, which we are pleased with. And the way we monetize that is we didn\u2019t take our expenses up with equity market uptick. The second one is client flows and activities. I think a couple of years back, this was a positive by a couple of points. I think a year or 2 years ago, as we saw outflows from packaged products in both \u2013 especially in the U.S. as mutual funds were on the wane and we saw less inflows in Europe. I think we felt less confident in client activity and flows of the tailwind. I think that\u2019s actually rebounded nicely this year, and we expect that to continue given the current market dynamics. Net new business, as you referenced, I think we have got a strong year here in terms of wins. That will now start to get implemented next year and the year after. So, that takes time, but we are pleased with the backlog. And then pricing, I think as I have said, I think on the first question this morning has been well controlled and we just work on that intensely every day. So, I think the structure is intact. Every year will bring a little different mix and different elements of the \u2013 of that framework. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that color Eric. And just for my follow-up, I know you provided some helpful color on the BBH rate sensitivity, or additional flex from having the off-balance sheet suite option. I was just curious how the improving rate backdrop, just taking the forward curve, it informs your willingness to onboard more than the $10 billion of deposits, which you disclosed at the time of the deal and just speak to the relative attractiveness of on-boarding a larger percentage of deposits versus maybe other forms of capital return, like buybacks and dividend increase? Eric Aboaf : Sure. And let me open up the aperture a little bit. Remember, the core of our capital constraint is around CET1, right, our common equity Tier 1 ratio, which is really a risk-weighted asset-based measure, not a leverage ratio measure. So, on the leverage ratio, we just need to be kind of within bounds. And so the decision on deposits and NII within reason is really around what rate levels we are sitting at. I think the way to think about the positives when prevailing short rates, call it, Fed funds is at the current levels, near zero, you are not incentive to have deposits on the balance sheet. That breakeven tends to flip at around two or three rate hikes, around 75 basis points of Fed funds. You start to be in a more neutral position and at 100 basis points of Fed funds you start to be the right way around or you would prefer the deposits on the balance sheet. And so it\u2019s somewhere in that area, call it, two, three rate hikes from now, where we begin to seriously thinking about the benefit of adding more deposits instead of being \u2013 instead of holding them off. And so I think the question that we will \u2013 the decision criteria that we will get to is where are prevailing rates in the first quarter and the second quarter and the third quarter next year. And at that point, we will make some conscious decisions and trade off additional NII, which we would like to bring in, because it helps with our margin and our EPS. And we will just have to just be careful about the balance sheet size. But you have seen us manage the balance sheet side. You saw it this quarter. And in fact, it\u2019s not like we \u2013 well, we know where to judiciously manage the balance sheet. And I think we will continue to do that while bringing on deposits and serving our clients as best as we can. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great color Eric. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Ron and good morning Eric. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Eric can you share with us when you guys look at your asset under custody wins, can you break it out geographically? And also, are the wins coming from competitors, or are they coming from just companies that were doing it internally and now have chosen to go with somebody like yourself? And how do the numbers in this quarter look compared to the prior couple of years? Is there a shift going on in either of those two dynamics? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Gerard, maybe I will begin and Eric will add in color. If you look at this quarter, the standout, obviously, from an AUC/A was legal in general. So, mostly UK, but some \u2013 there is an American element to that also. In that case, it was for the most part, a new client to us. We did not have \u2013 we had a nominal existing relationship to it. And it\u2019s an Alpha-driven mandate. So, lots of activities will be coming our way over time. If you look at the prior quarter, again, the standout there would have been Invesco, which was more of a U.S. based global client, where we had an existing relationship on the servicing side, we have \u2013 we are consolidating much of that and expanding into the middle and front office. So, I would say that what we have seen over the past couple of years in terms of the Alpha-related kinds of wins, it\u2019s been nicely mixed geographically. And as importantly, it\u2019s been \u2013 there has been more new client wins than we would have expected from the beginning. So, it\u2019s enabled us to drive new client growth and what\u2019s incumbent upon us then is to make sure that, obviously, if it\u2019s a new client, there they have got the traditional servicing business with somebody else. So, what we are doing strategically is we will have the discussion on Alpha. We will win the Alpha and then say, now we want to move the servicing business over. In terms of the core wins, the \u2013 I would say that there has been a little bit of a cycle here and Eric will correct me if I am getting this wrong. But after \u2013 if you go back a couple \u2013 3 years ago, EMEA was relatively light relative to the U.S., and we have seen actually over the past couple of years, a lot of activity in EMEA. And it\u2019s not so much that it\u2019s been less U.S. It\u2019s just been more activity in EMEA. So, that had a lot to do with changing out and rebuilding a sales force and things like that, that had been done in the U.S., hadn\u2019t quite been done until more recently in EMEA. So, it\u2019s \u2013 what we like is it\u2019s nicely mixed. And more recently, we are starting to see some activity in Asia Pacific, and we are really excited about Brown Brothers because of the truly leading position that they have in Japan that we will be able to leverage to support even more growth there. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Very good. And as a follow-up question and I apologize if you guys have addressed this already, in the revenue growth of servicing fees and management fees, 7% for servicing on a year-over-year basis, 10% for management. You have mentioned that client flows, new business growth, higher market levels contributed to this growth. How much of that growth was attributed to the higher market levels? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it\u2019s Eric. It varies by business. On servicing fees, a large proportion of the up 7% was driven by the equity markets tailwind, a smaller proportion from client flows and net new business. And then in the other direction, you have the usual smaller amount of pricing headwinds, and we also called out a little bit of divestiture activity. So, it\u2019s kind of two-third, one-third, but what I think I am particularly pleased with is we are able to hold expenses flat, notwithstanding that. And that\u2019s not been our history here as we have managed. On the management fee side, it was just the way that that business tends to be priced. The market tailwinds tend to come in and are a very important part of the tailwind. But we also had, I think, very nice net new business performance on the revenue side. You see it in flows. We also counted in revenues. But you saw there, us taking up our margin in the asset management business. And so while we are creating the environment for either an equity market tailwind or a flow tailwind in asset management, it\u2019s the \u2013 we are also managing the other side of the P&L, and that\u2019s been quite remunerative for us this quarter and pleasing. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And Eric, we all are looking forward to seeing you at the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference in about three weeks. So, we will see you then. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : See you shortly. Operator : Your next question is from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning guys. Just one more on the expense side, you highlighted some productivity savings this quarter, and that\u2019s been a trend recently. How much more is there left to do on the productivity side? And how much do you think that can continue to sort of offset any increases in other expenses going forward? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Rob, service productivity is hard work. And we have been at it now for a couple of years. And despite the progress that we see, we actually see more opportunities. It\u2019s not as easy as just like in manufacturing just substitute a people-driven assembly line with a bunch of robots. It\u2019s really activity-by-activity, substituting AI, substituting other kinds of automation, trying to eliminate reconciliations. And we are making progress against that, and we see the opportunity to do more. So, we see this as \u2013 it requires work, ongoing work and ongoing engineering, but we see opportunities over the next several years to continue to do more and more of this. Eric Aboaf : And Rob, it\u2019s Eric. I would just add as we adjust our outlook a little bit. Part of that was just year end incentives we need to reward really strong performance. But we also talked about starting to leg into investments. And we like to invest behind the revenue, not ahead of the revenue, but behind the revenue, and that\u2019s what we are doing. One of those investments, to be honest, is engineering work, right, development work to actually automate processes, simplify processes and so forth. And so, part of what we are doing even into the fourth quarter is beginning some of that work so that several quarters from now, a year from now, 2 years from now, there is actually an engineering benefit. And so that\u2019s where it comes together as well. But as Ron said, it takes real hard work and it gets done in phases. Rob Wildhack : Got it. Thank you for that. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Ron. Hi, Eric. A couple of questions for you folks on BBH acquisition, I remember you saying on the announcement of the call something about earn-outs. Can you talk a little bit about are these \u2013 is this additional payment over and above the purchase price, or is there something else for the partners who would have presumably gotten a part of that purchase price and cash that you are getting or can you give us some color on that. And what\u2019s the driver of that? What is it tied to and over what time period? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Vivek, so there is not an extra contingent payment here. So, let\u2019s put that aside. But what we have put in place, and it was part of our \u2013 as we talked about expected accretion here. We have put in place an incentive plan that\u2019s quite broad based. It\u2019s \u2013 basically, it\u2019s a success-based pool with the factors being client on-boarding and retention as well as staff retention. And everybody \u2013 well, all of senior management fairly deep into the BBH management participates in that. And there is targets out there in terms of client retention. There is targets out there in terms of desired staff retention. So, it was really meant to align BBH people around what we are aligned about, which is growing our client base and keeping our best talent. Eric Aboaf : And Vivek, it\u2019s Eric. You will see those costs in the acquisition restructuring line. So, we are purposely bounding it and \u2013 but including it in our financials. But they are modest. They are what you would expect us or any other acquirer to do in a deal. And given the combination, there is a real benefit in the execution here. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Great. Another one on BBH and Eric, maybe this is more for you, the BBH sweep program that you have mentioned previously too, how much of those deposits \u2013 how much of that sweep is at risk where banks not who are \u2013 who would not want to renew it because of capital constraints? So, how much of that would you need to take on? And if you couldn\u2019t, what\u2019s the alternative to that? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Vivek, we \u2013 as part of our diligence, we looked at every part of this acquisition, how the revenues come together and there, there is a lot of share of wallet opportunity, expenses, how it comes together and certainly, the sweep program. The sweep program is modest when it comes to the bank counterparties. It\u2019s not enormous for any one bank provider. I think the top 10 bank providers are important. But if you think about what swept away, I think we said about $60 billion, $70 billion is swept away today across 10 large banks. You are not talking about a real capacity constraint. And we did \u2013 we have done and we have actually engaged with each of those bank counterparties, most of whom we know extremely well and who we do business with, right. We often do business with those counterparties on the sub-custody side or in terms of other arrangements. And so there is kind of a \u2013 there is a bidirectional set of relationships that we have. So, we don\u2019t see a lot of risk at this point and see more of an opportunity to actually sweep a little more, sweep a little less. What I would say is the core of the sweeps in U.S. dollar \u2013 and I don\u2019t need to be patriotic to say that the U.S. dollar is an extremely valuable deposit and cash currency. And so that\u2019s \u2013 so they are certainly valuable to U.S. and global banks. And so I think we have got a good program set up, and we see it continuing with some upside optionality for us. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. If you can provide more color on your phrase, business investment for the next phase of growth. That sounds like something more significant than simply tweaking budgets going into year-end or anything like that. So, when you talk about this next phase of growth, I know you talked about Alpha, private markets, the digital space, but if you maybe just give more color on the overall tech strategy and the tech budget. How much are you looking to increase the tech budget from where it is now? How much of that is to change the bank? And which areas of tech are you investing such as the cloud or other areas? Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Mike, it\u2019s Ron. As I said earlier, we have been investing all along through this most recent period these last several years. And as Eric has noted, we have invested behind our revenue growth. So, the gates in our investment have not been necessarily opportunities, it\u2019s been what can we do to fund this growth off of our BAU spending. And second, where and how is the growth coming in. In terms of what we are investing in, it really isn\u2019t changing much other than from a balance perspective. I would say that much of the investment that you have seen over the past several years, if you think about the whole resilience area, the whole \u2013 I mean, this is imposed on all of us, resilience area, the cyber area would probably fall under the BAU or run the bank. Alpha has certainly been a change the bank kind of thing. And I think there is a \u2013 we would anticipate a little bit of a mix shift from run to change in terms of total amounts. But really, it\u2019s not going to be a kind of peanut butter of thing where everybody gets a little something here for their pet project. It really is about those things where we see it positioning us for meaningful growth, meaningful additional growth. So, we explain why, but that would be Alpha private market and State Street Digital kind of primarily. What I would add to that, continuing to selectively invest in Global Advisors. I mean the investments we have made there in the past, particularly, for example, in the active ETF space, what we \u2013 the investments we made in European ETFs and a low-cost ETFs, all of which are growing, and we are gathering disproportionate share in those space. So, that\u2019s how we think about it. I mean you shouldn\u2019t expect us to be throwing a lot of money at things that we don\u2019t know anything about or that are new to us, but it\u2019s about things that we have already established can give us growth and that with a little more investment, we expect to be able to accelerate that growth. Mike Mayo : Okay. So, spread around the peanut butter too much. But when you look at it by function, like I know you have \u2013 this predates you, Ron, but when you talk about the cloud or the back office and you talk about digitization, digitizing your operations, how are you looking at the cloud today in terms of public, private? How much of the workload has shifted? Where are you in that thought process? And how much does that play as part of your transformation? Ron O\u2019Hanley: I mean, Mike, we have been very active in the cloud, and we have, I think talked about this in other context. If you \u2013 I will use an example of what we are doing in Charles River and Alpha, which is an entirely right from the beginning when we said we were going to be open architecture and interoperable. That, by definition, meant that it had to be cloud-based. So, we have quite aggressively gone to the cloud. We have talked about our partnership, which was one of the first in this whole security services area with Microsoft and their Azure products. So, that is very much a part of it, and we think about it as being how can we \u2013 I mean, certainly there is a cost element to it is also how do we advance the business strategically and grow revenues. Mike Mayo : Alright. Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. Rajiv Bhatia : Good morning. Just one quick question from me, there are some headlines that hedge fund flows are pretty strong. So, can you comment on your alternative funds administration business? And what kind of growth are you seeing there? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Why don\u2019t I begin and Eric will pick up, Rajiv. I mean you are right. Hedge fund floats have been strong and going back to Mike\u2019s effort that would be another example of where we have invested fairly significantly in new technology there and in this case, using an outside provider. And we are enjoying the benefits of those flows. And I think that you will see \u2013 we expect to see more and more flows into alternatives, alternatives of all types. There is a further push to see this if you will, go into smaller, smaller accounts and the so-called democratization of it, and we want to be positioned for that. Eric Aboaf : And Rajiv, it\u2019s Eric. I will just add the private markets, the hedge funds are all attractive asset classes for us. And so year-on-year, we saw a 7% growth this year across the servicing fee franchise. In the private markets, you are seeing 2, 3 percentage point higher growth than the average for the company. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why over the last year or 2 years and certainly going into the fourth quarter next year, we are investing more in private markets because we see those opportunities, and that adds to the growth trajectory of the company. Rajiv Bhatia : Got it. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to our presenters. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, thanks to all on the call for joining us. And we look forward to speaking with you further. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you again for joining us today. This does conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Ilene Fiszel Bieler : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O\u2019Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today\u2019s presentation will contain forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the dedication and strong performance of State Street employees during the past year. These team members remain central to the continued successful execution of our strategy as we help to create better outcomes for the world\u2019s investors. Together, we accomplished a great deal in 2021, including higher fee and total revenue generation, successful execution against both sales effectiveness and client retention goals that is driving growth and business momentum, as well as announcing the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. All of this would not have been possible without our employees\u2019 hard work, skill and commitment. Slide 3 of our presentation highlights the progress we made during 2021, with both of our business segments performing strongly as we advance towards achieving our medium-term financial targets. Within the Investment Servicing business, we enhanced \u2013 our enhanced core strategy, combined with our strategic pivot to an enterprise outsourced solutions provider across the front, middle and back office, manifested itself in stronger business momentum and revenue growth in 2021, which you can see along the top of the slide. As we successfully diversify and broaden our wins by region and client segments, we achieved record AUC/A servicing wins of $3.5 trillion in 2021 and continued to deploy our enterprise outsourcing capabilities underpinned by our integrated front to back Alpha platform. We announced nine additional Alpha wins in 2021, with 10 Alpha clients now live at year-end. We also continue to enhance our product capabilities in 2021, launching Alpha for private markets as well as our new State Street Digital division. At Global Advisors, we executed well against our long-term strategy, which contributed to a number of records for that business in 2021, including revenues, assets under management and ETF inflows. Importantly, Global Advisors full year pre-tax margin expanded by over 6 percentage points in 2021 to a record 32%, deepening the value of our investment management franchise to State Street\u2019s results. Our SPDR business performed particularly well in 2021, gaining U.S. ETF flow market share, including low-cost and active in addition to the record inflows I just mentioned. As I look back at 2021, I am particularly pleased with our client impact, improvement in our sales effectiveness and heightened focus on client satisfaction, service quality and retention across our businesses, together with a favorable equity market backdrop, helps to drive a stronger revenue performance. Notably, full year servicing and management fees each reach our highest level on record in 2021, with total fee revenue increasing by 5% year-on-year and exceeding $10 billion for the first time. While we delivered a strong revenue performance in 2021, expense management remained a key focus for us, with company-wide productivity and engineering efforts achieving approximately $330 million of gross expense savings. Because of our strong revenue and sales performance in 2021 and the healthy pipeline in front of us, these efficiency savings allowed us to fund investments in our talent, technology and business in the fourth quarter to drive future growth. Even with this increase in investment, total expenses will contain relative to revenue growth, helping to drive a significant improvement in a number of key financial metrics that you can see on the bottom of the slide. Despite record low interest rates and excluding notable items, we delivered meaningful full year pre-tax margin expansion, positive fee and total operating leverage and EPS growth in 2021, and we expect to do this again in 2022. Turning to Slide 4, I will briefly touch on our fourth quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. 4Q 2021 EPS increased 28% year-over-year, or 18%, excluding notable items. The strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by solid total fee revenue growth, which more than offset interest rate headwinds on NII, leading to a good fourth quarter total revenue performance. We delivered 130 basis points of total positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items. Importantly, we again expanded State Street\u2019s pre-tax margin, which increased by more than a percentage point relative to the year-ago period to 28% in the fourth quarter, excluding notable items. The solid business momentum that we saw during 2021 continued into the fourth quarter, which you can see in the middle of the slide. AUC/A increased to a record $43.7 trillion at quarter-end and new asset servicing wins amounted to $332 billion for the quarter. AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, was $2.8 trillion at quarter-end, while Charles Rivers\u2019 annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter increased 9% year-over-year to $244 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.1 trillion at quarter-end, management fees increased to a record $530 million in the fourth quarter, benefiting from higher year-on-year average equity market levels and record inflows to our ETF franchise. Turning to our balance sheet at the bottom of the slide. Capital return remains a key part of our medium-term targets and we recognize its importance to our shareholders. As you know, we suspended common share repurchases in Q3 in connection with our intended purchase of Brown Brothers Harriman Investor Services. We currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of this year, in line with our previous expectations. To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased with the strategic operational and financial progress we demonstrated in 2021. We meaningfully improved our full year financial performance across a number of key metrics, creating value for our shareholders and advancing us towards our medium-term financial targets. Looking ahead, I have four core strategic objectives for 2022, which are aimed at helping us achieve our vision for the organization and position the business for future success. First is to continue to grow revenue by executing on a number of key strategic priorities this year, including completion of our pivot to an enterprise outsourcer underpinned by our Alpha platform build out; continuing to develop key product offerings and capabilities, particularly private markets; and further strengthening sales and client management capabilities and processes. Second, the successful integration of BBH Investor Services is a key priority. The proposed acquisition is a financially compelling use of capital. And once closed, it will strengthen our market leadership by creating the world\u2019s largest custodian, expand and deepen our international reach, further propel our Alpha strategy and add strong talent that will supplement our focus on client and service excellence and expertise. Third, as we did in 2021, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization. We are developing and implementing a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. This more scalable model will allow us to deliver increased client quality, operational capacity, speed and resilience. Fourth, we must continue to build an even higher performing organization. A performance culture and improved employee experience will enable us to sustain a more diverse, engaged and empowered team with the experience, capabilities and desired behaviors required for further \u2013 for future growth. These four goals reflect our relentless focus on performance and achieving our medium-term financial targets. I have confidence that we\u2019ll be able to meet our strategic and client goals, while also delivering positive fee and total operating leverage and expanding our pre-tax margin each year through our medium-term horizon, aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognize in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognize acquisition restructuring costs, most of which were related to CRD and whose integration is now complete. Second, we recognize the net repositioning release of $3 million, which consists of occupancy costs of $29 million as we continue to reduce our footprint and a release of previously accrued compensation costs were $32 million, as attrition picked up and we redeployed staff more effectively than anticipated. Third, we saw an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the competitiveness of our compensation program by accelerating expenses associated with certain deferred cash incentive awards. The impact of the acceleration increased expenses by $147 million in this quarter. This change will allow us to realign the mix of immediate versus deferred cash in our incentive compensation awards in future periods, which will make our pay practices competitive and enable us to better attract talent in an increasingly tight talent market. Our mix of deferred equity remains unchanged. Finally, you\u2019ll see that in the fourth quarter also benefited from a $58 million gain on sale legacy LIBOR base securities previously classified as held to maturity. This sale and this quarters\u2019 higher than usual tax benefits help to offset some of the deferred compensation expense acceleration I just mentioned. Turning to Slide 6, I\u2019ll begin my review of both fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. As you can see on the top left of the slide, we finished the fourth quarter with strong revenue growth compared to 4Q 2020. 4Q 2021 fee revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting strong growth in servicing fees, management fees and CRD revenues, only partially offset by lower FX trading services. 4Q expenses were well managed, delivering positive total operating leverage notwithstanding the significant 2021 NII headwind. 4Q pre-tax margin is up more than 1 percentage point year-on-year and ROE is up almost 2 percentage points. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2021 revenue performance. As Ron highlighted earlier, 2021 was a record year for us for fee revenues. And despite historically low interest rates in 2021, I\u2019m quite pleased that for the full year, we still delivered positive operating leverage of more than a percentage point improvement in pre-tax margin and EPS growth in the double digits. Turning to Slide 7, you\u2019ll see our Investment Services balanced growth remain strong as we saw record AUC/A the end of the fourth quarter of $43.7 a year-on-year increase of 13%, largely driven by higher market levels, client flows and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A growth was muted as markets were pretty mixed. At Global Advisors, AUM at year-end increased 19% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter to a record $4.1 trillion. The year-on-year in sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher market levels, coupled with net inflows. Of note, we reported strong net inflows during the fourth quarter of almost $80 billion. Our global SPDR ETF business recorded the highest ever quarter, driven by strong U.S. flows, pushing total net ETF inflows to $107 billion for the full year. Turning to Slide 8, you can see another quarter of good business momentum. Fourth quarter servicing fees increased 6% year-on-year. The increase reflects higher average equity market levels, client activity inflows and positive net new business again. These items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about a full point of currency translation. On a sequential basis, I would remind you that while the S&P was up on average, international markets were down, so markets were relatively neutral. Servicing fees were down 1%, primarily due to client activity and adjustments and the impact and appreciating U.S. dollar, partially offset by another quarter of positive net new business. AUC/A wins totaled a solid $332 billion in the fourth quarter, which gets us to a record $3.5 trillion new wins across client segments and regions for the full year and our pipeline remains strong. At quarter-end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed, amounted to $2.8 trillion, without representing a nice proportion, which reflects a unique value proposition and our competitive strengths as the only front to back offering from a single provider. Turning to Slide 9, fourth quarter management fees reached a record $530 million, up 8% year-on-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter, resulting in an investment management pre-tax margin of 34% for fourth quarter. The year-on-year management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. These year-on-year benefits were only partially offset by previously reported client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers of $20 million in the quarter. The quarter-on-quarter results were largely driven by a slight uptick in equity market daily averages. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by both strong quarterly momentum and full year results. We were particularly pleased that the actions that we\u2019ve previously taken over the years in our long-term institutional and ETF franchises delivered growth over the course of 2021. Regarding management fee money market waivers, we currently expect that they will come in at approximately $5 million less in the first quarter of 2022 based on an anticipated March Fed rate hike, which will be included in our 2022 outlook. Turning to Slide 10, let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail. FX trading services was down 7% year-on-year, reflecting lower FX volatility and lower volumes in our standing instruction business. On a sequential basis, FX revenue increased 8%, primarily driven by higher FX volatility, partially offset by lower volumes. Moving to securities finance. Fourth quarter fees increased 16% year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher clients securities loan balances and new business wins and enhanced custody. On a sequential basis, fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, mainly as a result of lower agency balances. Finally, fourth quarter software and processing fees were down 4% year-on-year and 2% lower quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower market-related adjustments, partially offset by continued growth in CRD, which I\u2019ll turn to next. Moving to Slide 11, I\u2019d like to highlight our CRD and Alpha performance. We delivered strong standalone CRD results in the quarter, with year-on-year revenue growth of 13%. Full year standalone revenue growth was a 11% year-on-year year, which makes this the second year in a row where we grew the business revenue in the double-digit range. The more durable SaaS and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely as we onboarded and converted more clients to the cloud. SaaS clients now represent nearly half of our CRD client base. In addition, we achieved record new bookings of $62 million for full year 2021, with a healthy revenue backlog of $117 million at quarter-end, demonstrating the continued business momentum as we head into 2022 supported by the Alpha \u2013 by the State Street Alpha value proposition. Turning to Alpha on the bottom right of this slide. Full year 2021 was a busy year, as we announced nine new Alpha mandates and nearly doubled the amount of wins we\u2019ve achieved since inception. At year-end, we have 10 total live Alpha clients. We\u2019ve also been busy enhancing our Alpha product offering this year. In addition to launching Alpha for private markets and our acquisition of Mercatus in the third quarter, we also went live with our Alpha data platform in the fourth quarter, which is our cloud native platform providing enterprise data management and access to all the data and analytics that our clients use to perform their daily end-to-end investment processes. Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII was down 3% year-on-year, mainly driven by the impact of a low 2021 interest rates on the investment portfolio yields, partially offset by another quarter of higher loan balances, as well as growth in deposits and the investment portfolio. Relative to the third quarter, 4Q NII came in 1% lower, primarily as a result of the expected normalization of premium memorization. As you may recall, third quarter 2021 included an episodic benefit worth about $7 million, which we previously noted wasn\u2019t expected to repeat in fourth quarter. We do, however, see continued premium amortization slowing. We, like many of you, are excited about the rise we\u2019ve seen in long-end rates this year. However, short rates have been flat so far and it\u2019s really the prospect of Fed action in the March timeframe, which would have a significant benefit on NII. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Average assets increased 4% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher deposit levels. We consciously allowed average deposits to float up this past quarter, which we then expect to monetize in a period of rising interest rates. Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were up 1% year-on-year as we previously decided to increase incentive compensation to reflect strong year-on-year performance and pulled forward some investments in the business. At the end of the year, however, we also experienced some higher than expected episodic expenses. Medical costs were higher as we saw ramp-up in year-end claims, we saw some elevated IT vendor costs and we realized higher marketing spend associated with GA volumes. Compared to 4Q 2020, on a line item basis excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation medical costs, partially offset by lower headcount and salaries. Notably, our continued focus on digitization, automation, as well as resource discipline has helped us reduce our headcount this year by 2 percentage points, even as we onboarded larger deals and process more transaction volume. Information systems and communications were up 11% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency, as well as the equipment expenses as we move more activities to the cloud. Transaction processing was down 7%, primarily driven by lower market data and brokerage costs. Occupancy was down 6%, reflecting the benefits from eliminating another 5,000 seats, and achieving 115% occupancy rate, and other expenses were down too. Overall, we\u2019re pleased this year with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline. Excluding the impact of currency translation with approximately 1 percentage point, full year 2021 expenses would have been flat. And in a year where fee revenue growth grew by mid single digits, we meaningfully expanded our pre-tax margin and generated positive total and fee operating leverage despite a challenging interest rate environment. Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels, whether without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements. As of quarter-end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 14.2% increased 0.7 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, primarily reflecting an outsized reduction of about $5 billion in RWA related to the impact of FX mark-to-markets and higher retained earnings. We expect our RWAs to increase in the first quarter to more normalized business levels and the effects of expected regulatory changes coming in 2022, all of which has been previously considered in our capital guidance. Our Tier 1 leverage decreased slightly quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by higher client deposits, and lastly returned a total of $209 million to shareholders in the form of fourth quarter dividends. As previously communicated, we expect our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges for the first half of 2022, inclusive of the implementation of SACCR and the expected closing of the Brown Brothers Investment \u2013 Investor Services acquisition. Turning to Slide 15. You can see a summary of our 4Q 2021 and full year 2021 results. I\u2019ve already covered fourth quarter in detail. So let me say a few words about our full year results before jumping into our outlook for 2022. In summary, we\u2019re pleased with our strong performance this year. Notwithstanding the challenging industry environment, we delivered a 5% increase in total fee revenue for the year with servicing and management fees reaching our highest levels on record. Our expenses for the full year remained well controlled, and despite higher revenue-related costs and investments in our business and people. As a result, even in last year\u2019s low rate environment, we delivered positive operating leverage and we\u2019re able to drive pre-tax margin and ROE closer to our recently enhanced medium-term targets. And with that, I\u2019ll turn to outlook. On Slide 16, let me cover our full year 2022 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which do not yet include the previously announced acquisition of the Brown Brothers Investor Services. We continue to target a closing by the end of the first quarter, although the timing could fall in the second quarter. We are in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals, some of which have already been secured. The process is proceeding at a slower pace than anticipated with many regulators around the world addressing the high volume of global M&A activity. That said, given the current higher equity markets step off and new interest rate forwards, we now expect about 25% year-on-year year EBIT growth for the acquired business for each quarter in the first year post closing instead of just 15% year-on-year EBIT growth in our original acquisition deal modeling. Now, as I usually do, let me first share some assumptions underlying our current views for the full year. At a macro level, our rate outlook largely aligns the current forward curve and assumes we see three U.S. rate hikes in 2022 with the first hike occurring in March. We are also assuming around 5 percentage point to point growth for equity markets in 2022, as well as further normalized FX market volatility, which influences our trading businesses. As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar will be stronger for the year, which will be a headwind to revenues, but mostly offset as a benefit to expenses. So beginning with revenue. For the full year, we currently expect that fee revenue will be up 3% to 4%, with servicing fees growing 2% to 3%, both include about a point of currency translation headwind for 2022. Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect fee revenue to be up 2% to 3% year-over-year, given equity market expectations and continue business momentum, with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expected to be up 8% to 9%. For full year NII, depending on the timing of the projected rate hikes, we expect 2022 NII to be up 10% to 12% on a year-on-year basis. Regarding first quarter of 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 4% year-over-year and still flattish sequentially. Now turning to expenses. As you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up just 1.5% to 2% on a nominal basis in 2022, as we continue to invest in the business and our people, while driving both positive total and fee operating leverage. We currently assume that this includes a 1 percentage point benefit to expenses due to this stronger U.S. dollar. You can also see on the walk that for full year 2022, we expect another year of growth saves of approximately 3 to 4 percentage points, which will help fund variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like Alpha, digital, tech infrastructure and automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2022, we expect year-on-year expense growth to be largely in line with the full year guide, and includes the seasonal compensation expenses, which occur in the first quarter. All in all, our plan is to invest behind the revenues and deliver both positive total and positive fee operating leverage. Finally, we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the 17% to 19% range for 2022. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning, guys. Happy New Year to both of you. So maybe we can start unpacking some of the guidance and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s going to be a good amount of follow-ups on the back of that as well. But maybe just starting with the fee guide, really zoning in on service and fees. State Street has obviously made a considerable amount of improvement in retaining clients and winning a business. So maybe help us unpack within the 2% to 3% growth for the year. What sort of contemplated from markets in terms of the benefit of the 5% that you guys highlighted earlier? So how much is the market benefit versus net new business and pricing? And I\u2019m assuming BlackRock is included in this guidance as well. But how much of a drag in this service and fee revenue you guys expect from loss of the BlackRock mandate? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it\u2019s Eric. Happy New Year to you, too. Let me cover fees and then servicing fees, which I think is where your focus. Our guide for total fee revenue is up 3% to 4% for the year, our guide for servicing fees up 2% to 3%. And obviously, that includes about a percentage point of headwind from foreign exchange. So in effect, the servicing fees are up, for example, 3% to 4% in our guide, adjusted for currency translation. If you think about the drivers, we\u2019ve factored in all the known events, both our growth, our installations, net new business and so forth. If you want to peel it apart a little more deeply, we start off at a good equity market level and we expect some year-on-year growth from equity markets, that\u2019s probably worth about 2 percentage points of a tailwind to growth. Flows and client activity, which \u2013 variable is probably worth another percentage point and part of our kind of fee structures. Net new business is \u2013 continues to tick up. We expect core net new business to be up 2%. And that obviously includes all the new onboarding, offset by any attrition. So that\u2019s on a net basis. And then obviously, there\u2019s just the usual, 2%, grind down of pricing. And that kind of gets you to the low end of our range. We think there\u2019s some upside, which is why adjusted for currency, the servicing fee guide is in the 3% to 4% range. And what it does is, it represents the continued acceleration of our business towards our medium-term targets, which are really in the 4% to 5% range. Alexander Blostein : Great, that\u2019s perfect. And just maybe staying on the topic, but looking at the expense side of the P&L, the 1.5% to 2% growth, I think, is contemplated on obviously the fee outlook that you\u2019ve just outlined. If we are in a tougher equity market backdrop, and let\u2019s say, you guys don\u2019t hit the 2% to 3% servicing fee growth, or the 3% to 4% fee growth. What is sort of the bookends around the expense growth trajectory that that will continue this year? So in other words, like in flat equity markets, should we expect you to be below the guide on expenses, given there\u2019s maybe more flexibility or kind of the range is the range and the revenue will be more kind of working independently? Eric Aboaf : Alex, that\u2019s a fair question. And you can see that part of the way we create some, I\u2019ll call it insulation for ourselves as we think about equity markets and where they might go, whether it\u2019s up a lot of modestly flat or down, is that we\u2019ve designed our plans with a view that we should and intend to deliver a couple points of operating leverage, and actually a couple points of fee operating leverage, right? That that couple of points gives us some flexibility to handle some variability in the \u2013 in what happens in actuality in equity markets. I think, certainly will move within our range based on what we see. Obviously, if we see a market \u2013 an equity market correction of down 5%, or down 10%, we\u2019ll do everything we can to come in below our range. And certainly, we can flex in this business, a full point can be flexed. It\u2019s not easy, but it can be flexed. And that would be the approach that that we take. But we\u2019re confident with kind of the level of equity markets they are today. Part of this \u2013 part of what we see is fairly \u2013 a fairly nominal uptick in equity markets. So we think there\u2019s a good kind of middle of the fairway plan, but we\u2019ll certainly flex it, we, to the extent that we can. Alexander Blostein : That\u2019s great. Thanks very much for the color. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about the BBH. I appreciate the discussion around the increase in EBIT from rates, how much is that? Can you speak to their off-balance sheet sweep, deposits, maybe update us on the level of that? And how you think those act at a rising rate environment in terms of the sweep fees is pretty similar to the spread on deposits? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it\u2019s Eric. The business that Brown Brothers has run on the investment services side is performing well. So what we\u2019ve seen is, with the higher equity markets, we\u2019ve seen their servicing fees come in a bit stronger for this coming year. I think that deposits both on-balance sheet and the swept ones are within the range of what we\u2019ve seen. And I think we describe those as bit under $10 billion on-balance sheet and a bit over $65 billion swept and they\u2019re coming in right around that range. And that\u2019s our expectation for 2022. The \u2013 both the on and off-balance sheet do have a good translation into higher revenues as rates move up. And the on-balance sheet betas are similar to ours. And we\u2019ve \u2013 we had very nice betas in the early part of the last rate cycle and expect to have that again on ours and on there. And then the off-balance suites also have betas. They\u2019re not quite as strong as deposits, but they\u2019re in the range actually and that also will provide some very nice, I think, fee growth as we take on that business. James Mitchell : Okay, great. And then maybe just pivoting to the asset management business, you had record flows, strongest flows in many years. Can you just describe where the biggest drivers of that growth are coming from? What you\u2019re doing to enhance that growth? And is this more just the environment\u2019s grade? Or do you think there\u2019s some sustainability to that inflow? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Jim, it\u2019s Ron. Let me take that. I think that the growth is reasonably broad-based in the sense that it\u2019s, firstly from our investments \u2013 an ongoing investments in the ETF business. So you saw lots of strength in the core SPDR offerings, which are really instruments of choice for the \u2013 for large institutional investors and good growth in areas where we invested active ETFs, fixed income, the low-cost ETFs or non-U.S. So we expect to continue to see a good performance there, particularly as we\u2019ve worked to solidify our position with institutional investors. Secondly, in the institutional \u2013 in the traditional institutional space, the team\u2019s done a lot of work in developing products that are companions to the core index business. We have a great client roster, and we\u2019ve seen some diversification in the \u2013 in that business. Then finally, we\u2019ve got a great cash business. And obviously, it ebbs and flows as cash does itself, but will also benefit a little bit from rising rate environments as is the remainder of the fee waivers goes away. So it\u2019s really across the board. James Mitchell : Okay, thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So first, Eric, I just wanted to unpack some of the NII \u2013 the assumptions underpinning some of the NII guidance. I was hoping you could just share some insights in terms of what you\u2019re contemplating as the Fed initiates QT in terms of just deposit flight broadly, or deposit runoff, and maybe deposit remixing kind of non-interest bearing deposits. And just in terms of spot rates, where you\u2019re reinvesting today versus the bank book yields? Eric Aboaf : Steve, it\u2019s Eric. Let me do that in reverse order. I think the front book and the back book are starting to converge in the investment portfolio. And you\u2019ll see that our investment portfolio yields took a \u2013 another small tick downward this quarter in fourth quarter. But starting in first quarter, we\u2019ll see that relatively flat and then you\u2019ll see a slow progression upward. So we\u2019re comfortable with where we are in terms of long rates. And obviously, the higher the loan rates come in, the better off, we\u2019ll be. The NI uptick for this year and then let me get to the question around balances and quantitative tightening, I think, is just comfortably dependent on the Fed increases. I think we\u2019re showing 10% to 12% expectations in NII, low more than half of that is off of rising short-term U.S. rates, about a little less than a quarter is off rising non-U.S. short-term rates, and then the last portion is off of the rise in long rates. So, we\u2019re really geared towards the front end rates, and then that flows through directly to balances. For deposit balances, we currently expect U.S. and international deposit balances to be flattish, I\u2019d say this this year. And I think we\u2019re all wrestling with what\u2019s the pace of the Fed\u2019s actions in terms of rising interest rates. When does that start? And then when did they start with the \u2013 with some amount of quantitative tightening? And I think it\u2019s just helpful to book in this. There has been a lot of discussion about quantitative tightening over the last week or two. Certainly, it will happen. If you go back to the last cycle, which was just three, four years ago, so not a long time away, quantitative tightening started two years after the first rate rise, and a full year after the second and third and fourth, kind of that steeper part of the rate rising cycle. And so, I think quantitative tightening, though, there\u2019ll be a bid ask range on this. This is something to expect in 2023, more than 2022. And we\u2019ll thereby and then have some effect on deposits. How much, it\u2019s hard to tell. As you know, this cycle, we\u2019ve controlled some of the uptick in deposits. We had pushed them off in third quarter, as you recall, let them back in this quarter. We\u2019ll certainly see some deposits ebb downwards in 2023 and 2024, perhaps, or potentially just say flattish. Because the question is the pace of the quantitative tightening. And if you recall, last time around, just, I guess, three, four years ago, I think the Fed felt like it tightened too much, right, and created some disruptions in the short-term money markets. And so while we expect some tightening to happen in, say, a year-and-a-half from now, or thereabouts, we\u2019ll see. The \u2013 I think the pace of the tightening maybe more moderate. But anyway, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see. That\u2019s, call it, 2023 topic. I think, 2022 should be fairly straight. Steven Chubak : Oh, thanks for that context, Eric. And just for a follow-up on how you\u2019re thinking about capital management. You spoke about reinitiating the buyback beginning in 2Q. I was hoping you can give us some context as to like what level of payout you\u2019re planning as we look ahead to 2022 to 2023. And just in terms of future changes to the capital regime, any guidance you can provide on the impact of SACCR or and preliminary thoughts on the impact of upcoming changes under Basel IV regime would be really helpful. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Sure. There\u2019s a lot there, Steve, in your question. So let me take it kind of from the near end timeframe to further out. We\u2019ve \u2013 I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our capital guidance that will be at the low end of our 10% to 11% range for CET1 in the first quarter. That includes both the SACCR being implemented and the consummation of the Brown Brothers acquisition. So, that I think will carry us through at the low end of our range for the first half of this year. And we \u2013 we\u2019re, I think comfortable with both of those. As we go through the year in the second quarter, we\u2019d certainly like to start the buyback. We\u2019ll see at what pace the pace of a buyback start will depend on the kind of the exact capital ratios as we hit first quarter and then second quarter. We\u2019ll see how OCI swings either positively or negatively. And so I think that then sets us up to start buying back stock in second quarter and then proceeding at pace in the third quarter, fourth quarter and beyond. And then I think at that point, we\u2019re back to trying to, or we\u2019re not trying, but operating within our guidance, that capital return should be in the 80%-plus of earnings. And that puts us, I think, in a way that we continue to return through dividends and buybacks capital in a nice, comfortable way. So, anyway, a nice path forward. But first half of this year, I think, low end of our ranges, and then the second quarter, and then third quarter, fourth quarter, we start to reinstate and then accelerate in buybacks to a comfortable level. The Basel III refinements, Basel IV end game, there are different ways, different vocabulary out there, certainly come to pass. Clearly, we\u2019ll get some benefits on the loan book that we have a smaller loan book than others, though, we\u2019ll probably get some headwinds from the funnel and to review the trading book, and then some headwinds from the ops risk capital charges. So my guess is it\u2019ll be a bit of a headwind. But like I said before, it\u2019s been all factored into our capital ratio guidance. We generate quite a bit of capital each year. And we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on our medium-term targets of returning 80% or more of earnings back to shareholders. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great a color. And just quickly, can you \u2013 did quantify the impact from SACCR just so we could start to reflect that in our models? Eric Aboaf : Yes. I didn\u2019t in the prepared remarks. But the rough amount, we carry typically about $115 billion of RWAs, it was a little less this quarter. SACCR is \u2013 will cost us in the first quarter, just over $10 billion. And we\u2019ve got offsetting actions worth about half of that \u2013 about half. So call it around $5 billion. So I think net basis, it\u2019s probably worth about $5 of RWA. But as I said before in my prepared remarks, this has all been factored in to our capitol guidance that we gave back over the last several quarters, and we\u2019re confirming and affirming that we\u2019ll be within our ranges in the first half of the year. Steven Chubak : Understood, Eric. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Eric. Good morning, Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Eric, can you give us some for the color on, you gave us good detail on the servicing fee growth, and how you expect to see that 3% to 4% grow this year with some new inflows, as you pointed out, but also from some equity improvement in the markets. I think you said about 2 percentage points of that number. When you take the \u2013 when you look at the equity portion, how important is the U.S. markets versus and EMEA and the other markets? Can you kind of give us a flavor, is it generally geared toward the U.S. markets that drives your growth? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it\u2019s Eric. It\u2019s really a mix, I think, maybe almost if I just think about the ranges, it\u2019s a bit under half, that\u2019s thrown by U.S. markets closer to probably, I don\u2019t know, a 30ish European markets and then Australian emerging markets just because of the, in some cases, the higher fee rates is also important, that could be worth 20%, 25%. The other, as you remember, we have part of our book is fixed income assets that we service. And so, that\u2019s why equity market tailwinds effect part of our book, but not all of our book in rising rates, we\u2019ve thought the opposite effect in \u2013 on the fixed income side. What I \u2013 just as we from a planning purposes as we go into the year, though, on a point-to-point basis or if we were to stay flat from now through the end of the year versus the average of last year of 2021, that in and of itself should give us at least point and a half of servicing fee lifts. And then what we\u2019re talking about is whether the point-to-point growth from December 31 to \u2013 2022 December 31, can give us that extra half a point. So, I think that\u2019s how you get the roughly 2 percentage point tailwind that we expect, somebody has in a way baked in assuming markets don\u2019t go down. And then a smaller piece is coming from some modest appreciation. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, you discussed it at your peers about the expectation of rising interest rates \u2013 short-term rates, Fed fund rates in 2022. Can you share with us the duration of the fixed income portfolio? And what rates should we watch carefully that would impact the AOCI, meaning, the mark-to-market would be negative for the portfolio? Eric Aboaf : Yes. We \u2013 the duration of the investment portfolio, we inch down this quarter, you could have seen that in the NII slide that we had, I think, we\u2019re at about 2.9 years. So, trended down a bit from the last quarters \u2013 last couple of quarters. And right now, we\u2019re a little more comfortable. We\u2019ve been investing in the belly of the curve, kind of a two to five-year range. I think the 10-year up through 2 percentage points is quite comfortable for us, including from an OCI management standpoint. I think if you get good bit of buffs, 2 percentage points on the 10-year, you kind of have a \u2013 you got a double effect. On one hand, you get an OCI ahead, which obviously creeps back over time. So it\u2019s temporary. And the other hand, you celebrate higher rates flowing through the investment portfolios over the coming quarters. So, I think it\u2019s mix, but net positive if we have some sort of spike at the back end. But it would affect just the mechanics of how we operate quarter-to-quarter on the margin. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate that. Thank you, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Gerard. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. You had another good quarter of loan growth here with average loans up 7.5% sequentially. What were the drivers there? And how sustainable do you think that is into 2022? Eric Aboaf : Rob, it\u2019s Eric. Loan growth has been good for us the last, say, couple of years, to be honest. I think we\u2019ve comfortably driven loan growth quarter after quarter, up in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis. This quarter, we continue to see good client demand, but we also shifted some \u2013 we also added some CLOs in loan form, as we reduced the CLOs and securities form from the investment portfolio. So, there was a bit of a shift. That said, I think, in general, what we\u2019re comfortable doing is continue to grow poor loans, because that\u2019s \u2013 we won\u2019t always have a shift every quarter, this is more episodic, just as we rebalance and think about stress testing and how to operate efficiently with our multiple constraints. But we\u2019re still comfortable, continue to grow this loan portfolio in the low double-digit range, it won\u2019t happen every quarter. There\u2019s a little bit of seasonality, but we continue to see quite strong demand from our alternatives clients and private equity capital call financing. We see demand in some parts of the alternative and real estate markets that we play in. And the biggest focus I\u2019d say is as we lend more and deploy capital to our clients, a lot of what we do is work with them and make sure that\u2019s part of a broader relationship because that\u2019s where it really is renew motive for us and for them and helps us grow the \u2013 helps us build the reputation and the momentum to build the fee line as well. Rob Wildhack : Got it. Thank you. And then turning to expenses and operating leverage, the outlook implies maybe a 2 percentage point delta between fee growth and expense growth, but it also bakes in plus 5% or 6% from investments and variable costs. Do you think of that is still an elevated level of investment? And there\u2019s some more operating leverage available longer-term? Or is this kind of the required level of investment going forward? Eric Aboaf : It\u2019s hard to forecast the future. The amount of investments is partly around what\u2019s table stakes in the marketplace and partly around where do we see opportunities to differentiate our offerings. And clearly, you\u2019ve seen us invest in particular in Alpha, in the front office and Alpha that spans into the middle and back office. And we\u2019re also finding opportunities in the back office to invest through sort of feature functionality enhancements and custody in some areas of accounting, which also is attractive in segment by segment. So it\u2019s hard for me to say, what\u2019s the necessary amount of investments, we think there\u2019s a range. We think last year, we probably invested a bit less than this, probably, instead of 5% to 6%, I\u2019d say, there was probably a 0.5 less of investments during 2021. So I think what you\u2019ll see is, you\u2019ll see us flex the amount of investments from one year to the next. I think what we\u2019re conscious of is that confidence in investing should come from seeing the revenue growth and seeing the revenue growth from past investments. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing the revenue growth on the past investments that we\u2019ve made across the franchise, and I think that gives us the confidence to continue to carefully invest in some cases, accelerate that, but I think in in modest ways. I think the other part of our culture has been to \u2013 at the same time as we invest, find productivity and savings. And that\u2019s \u2013 we think that\u2019s an important part of how to run a business, but certainly a business that over time, we\u2019re digitizing and automating should come with productivity, savings and engineering. And I think the other part of our business processes, and I think you hear this from our senior executives, the more we can drive in productivity saves, the more we feel comfortable in investing, and that\u2019s a very \u2013 that\u2019s a virtuous circle. Rob Wildhack : Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Rob, what\u2026 Rob Wildhack : I\u2019m sorry, Ron, go ahead. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: What I would just add to that is that it\u2019s actually good news that we\u2019re seeing opportunities to invest in the business. Because particularly as we\u2019ve built out the Alpha platform, which was originally aimed at the asset management space in the traditional asset managers, we\u2019re now starting to roll out Alpha for private markets. So it\u2019s good that we\u2019re seeing the opportunities. But I would underscore Eric\u2019s point that notwithstanding that goodness, what we\u2019re focused on is continuing to eke out higher and higher productivity. And we see more opportunities there. So we see the ability of this virtuous cycle to continue for quite a while longer. And the fact that there are investment opportunities, is actually a good thing, because it shows that notwithstanding the narrowness of our, where we operate, there\u2019s plenty of places to grow. Rob Wildhack : Got it. And fair to characterize it then that this level of investment maybe last year and this year gives you the capacity and the room to play both offense and defense? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Rob Wildhack : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : I like that Ron\u2019s. Question, on the deferred comp acceleration, I\u2019m just curious, what level employ we \u2013 are we talking? And I\u2019m asking because the deferred portion, obviously, you saying to get practices more competitive. So that is \u2013 that presumes that you are different more than peers and that going forward, you have a higher cash piece going forward. I\u2019m just curious on, it\u2019s probably included, obviously, in your expense guide, but what\u2019s changing here and what why was well sticking? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Glenn, for the \u2013 the employees that are going to feel this would be our \u2013 not our most senior employees, it would be kind of the middle senior, lower senior, if you will, and down. So in our parlance, AVPs, VPs, MDs and some of the Senior Vice Presidents will fear. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Eric Aboaf : And then, Glenn, just to give you a context, the \u2013 we\u2019ve made this change, we had made one change five years back, and I think this now gets us to be competitive with the marketplace. And the way to the content \u2013 the facts that might help a little bit is way back when we had immediate cash in the 30% range of compensation for the average employee, the deferred cash was 40% and the equity, the deferred equity was 30%. That was a place that was completely out of market. We fixed about two-thirds of that five years ago and got to 50% immediate cash, 20% deferred cash, and 30% deferred equity. And now we\u2019re \u2013 with this final change, we\u2019re going to take that up to the immediate cash to 60% to 65% deferred cash to just 5% to 10%, mostly for the most senior folks and then the deferred equity stays at 30%. So we think we\u2019re now in line with the market as part of this change. What does happen is you\u2019ve got to crystallize some of the \u2013 some of these deferrals into the P&L in the current period. And then what that allows us to do is going forward to add to the cash mix. And because we\u2019ve crystallized the previous deferrals, those don\u2019t hit the P&L in the future, but the new cash will hit the P&L in the future. So this will be neutral to subsequent periods on the expense line. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you. Very helpful. The one I was going through your four objectives, Ron, and the first three, I think, are straightforward, and I think everyone has high confidence in your ability to do those. I\u2019m curious on the how to and what you\u2019re doing, what you\u2019re going to measure? And number four, which was the must be a higher performance oriented organization, just curious how you talk to us \u2013 how you can execute on that? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. So I mean, this is an ongoing objective of ours, Glenn, and it really is around performance culture. And if you think about culture, which is a very used and sometimes maligned term, for us, it\u2019s about desired behaviors. And on the flip side, kind of eliminating undesirable behaviors. So what we\u2019re focused on is those desirable behaviors, all those \u2013 all related to kind of driving performance. I would argue that it\u2019s even more important now than when we started a couple of years ago, because on top of everything else that we need in terms of serving our clients and serving our shareholders, we\u2019re now operating, we\u2019re now all operating in this hybrid world for the foreseeable future. That puts a burden \u2013 new burdens and new requirements on managers, particularly middle managers. So it\u2019s all about being able to eke out the benefits, which are considerable in a hybrid world in terms of employee flexibility and some real estate cost savings and those kinds of things, but at the same time, making sure that we\u2019re continuing to deliver where we are. So we think about performance in terms of \u2013 and we think about culture and high performance in terms of behaviors. Glenn Schorr : Excellent, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to circle back, Eric, I believe, just wanted to kind of clarify some of the points you made. I think you talked about BBH and the EBIT growth expected to accelerate here in 2022 up to 25%. So just to make sure I\u2019m level setting correctly, you also talked about some strengths in servicing, it\u2019s not all NII. That 25%, should we apply that to the $375 million that you provided previously, when you announced the deal? Or did that actual number shift from expectation? And am I using the right baseline? And then for the other disclosures you provided around the revenue and whatnot, should we \u2013 did those shakeout in line with expectations? Or did they work out to be a little better, as you alluded to? And how should we think about that baseline when we think about three quarters of a year here for them? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Let me \u2013 fair questions, Brennan. It\u2019s Eric. We had, as you remember, accurately estimated their 2021 performance to be EBIT of about $375 million, and they came in right around that level. So we\u2019re comfortable with that as a base case. And if you recall, we had shown 17% growth from 2020 to 2021 in our \u2013 in some of our documentation, as we announced, the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition. From a deal model perspective, at the time, we had expected off of the 2021 base to grow at about 15%. So, in line with the past part of that was the the equity market tailwinds continued to play through, and part of that was just good business performance, the \u2013 our Brown Brothers colleagues and investment services really tried a nice set of initiatives each year to try grows, client activity, and so forth. And what we\u2019re finding now, it\u2019s because of the equity market step off in the interest rate environment, and we expect to be roughly at about a 25% EBIT growth from 2021 to 2022. I think a portion of that is the \u2013 is on the equity \u2013 is on the servicing fee line, a portion that is on the fee line that comes from the sweeps, remember that comes through the feeds as well. And then a portion is from on-balance sheet NII, and I don\u2019t have the pieces handy. But clearly, the interest rate tailwind is probably the more significant of those factors, and that\u2019ll affect both the on-balance sheet and the sweat deposits. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Thank you for that clarification. And then a separate issue. From my second question, it looks like there\u2019s a transition of leadership, seems like Cyrus is retiring in the asset management business. That\u2019s been a business where there has been both speculation and open discussion with you all in the past about strategic direction and whatnot. What does the transition in leadership present as far as an opportunity to shift strategic direction? And what can you let us know about your updated thoughts on that business and whether or not a leadership transition is impacting the direction you want to go? Thanks. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Brennan, I mean, as you can maybe see from our results, we\u2019ve invested in that business. Over the years, the investments are paying off. We\u2019d like the business. It\u2019s very complimentary to the core servicing business, having one of the largest asset managers, also as our client of our core business has been able to let us have a bit of an R&D laboratory. There\u2019s client overlap in certain segments like asset owners and sovereign wealth funds, that we\u2019ve gotten better and better at it leveraging. So we\u2019d like the business. We intend to stay in the business. Under Cyrus leadership, they\u2019ve done a great job, and the numbers speak for themselves there. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a broad strategic change here. Certainly not in that direction I just outlined. I mean, there\u2019s always opportunities to do more and do better in all of our businesses. So we\u2019ll want to continue to do that. We\u2019ve got a very strong talent base there, but this is an attractive business and one in which we will look inside and out and get the right person to take us to the next level here, but we have full intention of continuing to plan and grow that business. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW. Michael Brown : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I appreciate the update on BBH and the \u2013 you made outlook there. And I guess as we move closer to that closing date, I was just curious that the change in the EBIT outlook in the operating environment, does that actually trigger any increase in the total consideration that will need to be be paid? Obviously, the implied valuation would be lower than at announcements. So that was just one thought that crossed my mind. And then the follow-up there is, can you just remind us of the unexpected fee synergies specifically, which ones do you feel confident that you can deliver on sooner after the close versus the one that will take more time to come through? Thank you. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Mike, why don\u2019t I start that and I\u2019ll turn the synergy part of the question over to, Eric. But no, there\u2019s no contingencies in the purchase price either up or down other than than the usual ones that you would expect in terms of risk management. So no, there\u2019s no additional payment that will be due here. Eric Aboaf : And, Mike, it\u2019s Eric. Just on the synergies, I think each one of them has a cadence, some of which we did spell out I think on the cost synergies, which is the opportunity, and that\u2019s obviously sometimes will come out of there base of expenses, sometimes our base of expenses, as we put the two together. We had estimated about 40% of our cost synergies would come in, in year one, and then the balance, year two and three, and that\u2019s probably the single largest area. In terms of the the fee synergies, the balance sheet actions should come through relatively quickly. We can modulate the amount of swept versus on-balance sheet deposits, because we\u2019ve got the capital resources plan for that. And I think that\u2019s one of the ways that we create real value./ And then the last one on the fee revenue synergies. Now some of the FX kind of markets, synergies come in a little more quickly, right, because it\u2019s about offering a broader set of, say, FX products on which were more capital intensive than simple swaps forwards, that is more about setting up clients, and then quickly being there for them. And then some of the servicing ones take a little longer and part of the sales cycle, but I think there\u2019s a good mix. And obviously, as we work on closing and bring Brown Brothers in, part of what we\u2019ve been doing is, as you expect kicking the tires on what are the opportunities, how to go the next round of definition on those, so that we can hit the ground running. And as I said, when we announced the deals, we\u2019d like to meet or exceed our targets. And I think the exogenous market, tailwinds are part of that, but we\u2019d also like to do it on through old fashioned execution as well. Michael Brown : Okay, great. Appreciate the color there. And maybe just one last one, just a quick clarification. Apologies, I missed. But did you quantify that discrete tax benefit? Or is the best way to think about that is just back into it after considering your typical tax rate? Eric Aboaf : It\u2019s \u2013 I wrestled, Mike, with that, because there were actually a series of tax benefits that came through this quarter, there was some closing of the previous year tax books, there were some foreign credits that accrue in those jurisdictions, which then help our GAAP taxes, and then there\u2019s some foreign credits that then kind of map back into the U.S. as a tax payments as deduction. So there\u2019s a series of them. I think the best way to do it is to probably take our full year tax rates are typically in the 17% to 19% range. So, you take the midpoint of that, think about full year this year now with this \u2013 with these discrete, which were more elevated than usual in a good way got us to closer to 15% tax rates. I think the difference is probably the \u2013 you might call the lumpy piece. What I do \u2013 what I would though also notice that I think tax planning has been the kind of thing that we\u2019ve done for many years. We do it. We\u2019re always on the bright side of the line, and we do it carefully. We \u2013 part of it being an international bank. We, like other international banks, are able to do some a modest amount of tax planning. And so you\u2019ll see it, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we see that come through the P&L annually, it just tends to be a little lumpy quarter-to-quarter and it was a little more lumpy, good than usual this particular quarter. Michael Brown : Okay, understood, I appreciate. The taxes are always complicated subject. So thanks for the color there, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe circle back on the deposit opportunity for BBH. Just to clarify, I think you said there\u2019s right now $10 billion of deposits set on the balance sheet at BBH and then $55 million additional in the sweep program. And I think initially, you\u2019re planning to bring about a total of $20 billion, inclusive of the deposits on the balance sheet over to, say, if you convert, initially, I think $14 billion was the conversion to get you to $20 billion. Maybe if you could just update us on the plan for 2022, if you do close at quarter-end in the first quarter of what you\u2019d like to bring on? And then maybe just talk more strategically about what \u2013 maybe what kind of portion of that sweep opportunity you might bring on to on the balance sheet, I guess capital submitting? Eric Aboaf : Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Eric. I think you have a good estimate of those just for the broader group, I think we said about $5 billion to $10 billion are on the balance sheet today. About $65 billion are off-balance sheet and swept. And as we consummate the acquisition, and we\u2019re targeting the first quarter, we said it \u2013 at the end of the first quarter, we\u2019re targeting, we said it could be in the second quarters, this stuff just takes time. We\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019re looking to bring on the $5 billion to $10 billion that they have on the balance sheet, and probably another 10ish or so, that is swept. I think over time, the question is really, at what interest rate levels do we operate at if we\u2019re at prevailing short rates of 50 basis points, let\u2019s say, then on balance sheet deposits aren\u2019t terribly attractive. But when you hit prevailing rates of 100 bps, or 200 bps, and obviously, you can do this across different currencies, then you\u2019re more inclined to bring more on balance sheet. And so we think of it as a range. I think we also, though, are quite \u2013 we want to be quite thoughtful about maintaining a program that, that works. It works well, for our clients, and the Brown Brothers Investment Services clients. It works well for a number of global financial institutions, that they have relationships with that they sweep, primarily dollar deposits to who appreciate those deposits. And so we certainly want to maintain the program for suites, want to maintain it in size. But you can certainly see swings of another $10 billion beyond the initial move potentially. But we\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019ll see when we get there. And part of it will be discussions with the clients themselves on one hand, and part of it will be the with the counterparties. And I think there\u2019ll be goodness and opportunity here in most circumstances. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. And maybe just this segue to second question on deposit beta expectations. I think you mentioned, you thought they might be the similar to the last hiking cycle, just to confirm that. It seemed like it moved around a bit during the cycle, but kind of ended up around, it looks like a little over 30% of its deposit beta relative to Fed funds rates at the time. I don\u2019t know maybe if you can clarify that and if you think that would be similar this cycle and obviously, if you would \u2013 you\u2019d be treating those BBH deposits in a similar fashion or do they have a different profile? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Brian, and it was actually a good opportunity as we see rates rise and the likelihood of Fed funds, but we did get a chance to go back and revisit what we both said and what we saw in from a deposit beta standpoint back in 2015, 2016, 2017. I do expect the Brown Brothers deposits behave similarly to ours. They are primarily with asset managers. They are currency by currency similar to ours. But if you go back, and I think we were good about disclosing our quarter-on-quarter interest-bearing deposit betas, and usually you have to do it by currency, right? So, because of how the betas play through. But in the first rate, the first one or two rate hikes, we saw and expect, again, to see deposit betas and, call it, 10% range, maybe 10% to 15% range, but it\u2019s quite low. When you get to the third, fourth or fifth hike, you\u2019re in the 30% range plus or minus some as you like into the rate cycle. And it\u2019s really, when you get in the past, they\u2019re in the fifth, sixth, seventh hike, where you\u2019re likely to get closer to 50% interest-bearing deposit betas. Now, I\u2019d like to get there. I \u2013 we\u2019d be pleased with with 50% if we get there with that level prevailing rates. But there\u2019s \u2013 I think there\u2019s a good opportunity here, because in truth, we\u2019ve been quite limited in our ability to earn NII that covers our cost of capital. And so a lot of this is just catch up in a to a levels that are more in line with the long-term averages. Brian Bedell : That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ronald O\u2019Hanley for closing remarks. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, operator, and thanks to all on the call for joining us. Operator : Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",

Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone. Earlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our results, I would like to briefly reflect on the operating environment in the first quarter, which included both significant geopolitical events as well as notable macroeconomic developments and market movements.  Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation. First, I would like to acknowledge the ongoing events in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In March, I traveled to crack out to visit some of State Street's approximately 6,400 employees in Poland. During my visit, I was moved by the selflessness of our colleagues in Poland, who continue to support displaced Ukrainian people in a number of important ways from opening their own homes and providing shelter to offering professional support, such as interpretation services. While State Street's direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is very small, our teams are responding fluidly to the situation and delivering for our affected clients and other stakeholders with dedication and professionalism in what continues to be a stressful time. We have well-established and regularly tested business continuity plans designed to continue critical services for our clients and support for our people. The first quarter also saw dramatic market movements, driven partially by the conflict in Ukraine, plus a broader set of macroeconomic forces. A tight labor market, rising energy prices, continued supply chain disruptions and the ongoing effects of significant COVID-related fiscal stimulus has contributed to inflation reaching multi-decade highs. As a result, in March, we saw the first interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve since late 2018, a substantial upward move in long-end interest rates as well as volatile currency and equity markets and a stronger U.S. dollar. Each of these factors in part shaped State Street's financial results in the first quarter, which I will now discuss before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail.  Starting with our financial performance. First quarter '22 EPS increased 15% year-over-year and was up 8%, excluding notable items, with earnings growth supported by both higher total fee revenue and stronger net interest income, leading to an improved year-over-year total revenue performance in the first quarter. Within fee revenue, our global markets franchise performed particularly well, driven by higher FX market volatility. And while State Street's revenue performance improved, we also remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Notwithstanding continued new investments in our business and operational capabilities, first quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and increased just 1%, excluding notable items, supported by ongoing productivity efforts and the stronger U.S. dollar.  Taken together, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as pretax margin expansion, good earnings growth and higher return on equity relative to the year ago period. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide, we recorded another quarter of solid new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $302 billion in the first quarter, while AUC/A won but not yet installed amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter-end. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum with annual recurring revenue for the first quarter, increasing 15% year-over-year to $235 million.  At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $4.0 trillion at quarter-end. Importantly, we saw another quarter of solid net inflows of $51 billion despite the volatile market environment in the first quarter. Our ETF business continued to perform well as we further focused on innovation and enhancing our ETF product offering. For example, in January, Global Advisors launched 3 new ESG-oriented SPDR ETFs across small-cap international and emerging market equities, aimed at helping investors incorporate ESG considerations into their portfolios. In February, Global Advisors expanded its fixed income offering with the debut of the actively managed SPDR Blackstone high income ETF as we continue to innovate in the active ETF category, which accounted for 13% of U.S. net industry flows in the first quarter.  At State Street Digital, we announced a number of exciting developments. In March, we entered into a licensing agreement with Copper co, a provider of institutional digital asset custody and trading infrastructure. We intend to leverage Copper.co's technology to develop an institutional-grade digital custody offering where clients can store and settle their digital assets within a secure environment operated by State Street.  Turning to capital. Our ratios remained healthy, although CET1 declined quarter-over-quarter, largely due to lower AOCI, driven by the significant moves in interest rates. In the coming quarters, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital ratios.  Regarding BBH, the regulatory review process for the proposed acquisition of the BBH Investor Services business has progressed more slowly than we anticipated. While many required approvals have been obtained, some required regulatory approvals, most notably approval to the relevant federal banking agencies, remain outstanding. We are evaluating potential modifications of the transaction that are intended to facilitate resolution of the bank regulatory review. We are working towards concluding regulatory reviews during the third quarter.  While we are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the relevant federal banking agencies, there can be no assurance of the timing or outcome of their regulatory review. Both parties, State Street and BBH, continue to be excited about the overall financial and strategic opportunities of combining BBH Investor Services with our business. We are continuing to work closely with the BBH team on pre-integration planning. This includes all the preparatory work in product, operations, technology as well as employee communication and client planning. We still expect the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share in the first quarter -- first year post closing.  To conclude my opening remarks, the first quarter was defined by both unexpected significant geopolitical events and notable macroeconomic and market developments, in the face of which State Street delivered an improved year-over-year financial performance and solid business momentum metrics while supporting our clients and colleagues. As we look ahead in this environment of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and market volatility, we remain laser-focused on delivering what is within our control, including excellence of strategic execution across the front, middle and back office, maintaining the recent improvement in our sales effectiveness and expense discipline all while continuing to provide valuable insights and promote better outcomes for the owners and managers of the world's capital. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.57 or $1.59 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs. On the left panel of this slide, you can see we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth with strength in many of our businesses, notwithstanding the macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we held total expenses roughly flat year-on-year as we continue to both invest in the franchise and control expenses. As a result, we generated positive operating leverage of about 5 percentage points in the quarter and continue to improve our pretax margin year-over-year. All things considered, this was another strong quarterly performance, demonstrating the progress we are making as we continue to improve our operating model and drive growth.  Turning to Slide 5. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% year-on-year and decreased 4% quarter-on-quarter. The year-on-year change was largely driven by higher period end equity market levels, client flows and net new business growth. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely the result of lower period end market levels in both equity and bond markets. Similarly, at Global Advisors, AUM increased 12% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the increase was also driven by higher period end market levels coupled with strong net inflows across all 3 of our franchises, our ETF, institutional and Cash businesses.  The sequential decline was primarily driven by lower market levels, which was partially offset by strong net inflows of $51 billion in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6. Before I start, I would like to remind you that we are expanding our servicing fee revenue disclosures by disaggregating the line into back-office servicing fees and middle office services. With that, on the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees were flat year-on-year as higher client activity and flows average equity market levels and net new business were offset by normal pricing headwinds and a 2% currency translation headwind.  We continue to see good growth in both our insurance and official institutions client segments. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the seasonal pricing headwinds and lower average equity market levels partially offset by strong client activity. Within servicing fees, back office fees were flat both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described.  Middle office servicing was down 3% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to a partial transition from a legacy climb and lower professional services fees in the quarter. Notwithstanding the decline in the quarter, middle office is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it comes to both the front office when it connects to both the front and back office, and we expect to see good growth over the medium term. As evidenced by our uninstalled revenue backlog, which I'll talk more about in a moment.  In terms of business momentum, I'm pleased with how 2022 has started. As we report another quarter of solid new AUC/A wins of $302 billion, while AUC/A won 1 but yet to be installed, amounted to $2.9 trillion at quarter end. We continue to be happy with our pipeline, and I'm also particularly pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of strategically important premium and preferred clients.  Turning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $520 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and strong ETF inflows. Management fees were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity market headwinds, partially offset by the tailwind of lower fee waivers and net inflows. Of note, our management fee performance for the quarter was supported by strong net inflows of $51 billion with positive inflows across our entire business franchise, Institutional, Cash and ETF.  With respect to money market fee waivers, the fee waiver impact to management fees for the quarter was roughly $10 million, down from about $20 million in the fourth quarter. I would note that following the 25 basis point Fed hike we saw in March of this year, we no longer expect money market fee waivers to be a headwind to management fees starting in April. As you can see on the bottom of the slide, our franchise remains well-positioned for growth. I'm particularly pleased that the strategic actions that we've previously taken in our long-term Institutional and ETF franchises are now helping to draw inflows even in the current volatile market environment. On Slide 8, you can see that FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, FX trading services revenue was up 4% year-on-year and 20% quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter performance benefited from high FX market volatility while higher client FX volumes also contributed sequentially. Part of the revenue uptick has come from about $5 billion in higher risk-weighted assets we put to work this quarter, which demonstrates our balance sheet flexibility and which I'll come back to in a moment.  Our securities finance revenues decreased 3% year-on-year, primarily driven by lower average agency assets alone, partially offset by solid new business wins in enhanced custody. Sequentially, revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting lower average agency and enhanced custody balances due to the declining market levels and fewer specials. First quarter software and processing fees were up 26% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I'll turn to shortly.  Finally, other fee revenue of $29 million almost doubled year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, mainly reflecting fair value adjustments on equity investments.  Moving to Slide 9. We've provided a breakdown of our consolidated front office software and data revenue on the left. We've broken down the revenue into software categories you have seen us use before, on-premise, professional services and software-enabled revenue. While CRD represents a large majority of this line, Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and [indiscernible] revenues are also included here as well. As we've highlighted earlier, front office software revenue growth was particularly strong, up 44% year-on-year, primarily driven by on-premise renewals as well as the continued strong growth in software-enabled and professional services revenues.  On the right of the slide, we've provided some key growth metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha. As I mentioned earlier during today's presentation, you'll notice that we've broken out both the front office and middle office uninstalled revenue backlog, both of which are key components of our alpha proposition going forward. The front office backlog of $93 million is up 43% and the middle office backlog has more than tripled year-on-year to $63 million. The backlogs reflect expected annualized revenue, which can be compared to the $900 million of annual revenue base in 2020 across both the front and middle office businesses and is an indicator of future revenue growth once fully installed.  The Alpha pipeline remains promising despite the current geopolitical environment as clients realize the transformational benefits to their technology and operations infrastructure.  Turning to Slide 10. As we see the start of another rate tightening cycle, first quarter NII increased 9% year-on-year, primarily driven by growth in our investment portfolio coupled with higher loan balances, which will also benefit us in future quarters. Relative to the fourth quarter, NII was up 5%, which came in better than expected due to higher long end rates. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields together with higher investment portfolio balances.  On the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter, which has been relatively steady. Average assets were down 3% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower 1Q deposit balances, which are down slightly from the seasonally high fourth quarter, but up year-on-year.  Turning to Slide 11. First quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 1% year-on-year or 2% adjusted for currency translation. Productivity savings and targeted investments remain on try for the first quarter as we generated approximately $90 million in year-on-year growth savings and self-funded most of the strategic investments we've been making in the businesses, including technology infrastructure, broader automation, Alpha and State Street Digital. Compared to first quarter on a line item basis, excluding notable items, compensation and employee benefits was down 1% as lower head count in high-cost locations and the tailwind of currency translation was partially offset by higher seasonal expenses.  Information systems and communication expenses were up 5% due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency. Occupancy was down 13% due to footprint optimization and lower maintenance costs and other expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees. Relative to the fourth quarter, expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal expenses partially offset by productivity and footprint optimization savings. Headcount increased slightly quarter-on-quarter as we began to in-source some technology functions from vendors and growth in Alpha. Overall, we remain focused on delivering positive total and fee operating leverage and have demonstrated that this quarter amidst the current macroeconomic environment.  Moving to Slide 12. We show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio decreased by 2.4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 11.9% due to both numerator and denominator effects. RWA increased by roughly $15 billion or 160 basis points of CET1 during the first quarter of 2022 compared to year-end, driven by 3 factors : a modest rebound from an unusually low fourth quarter; a strategic and temporary allocation of additional RWA capital to our markets businesses to generate the higher-than-expected first quarter revenues that we just discussed; and lastly, the RWA impact from the SA-CCR implementation that started on January 1 of this year, which we had planned for. At the same time, our capital base was also impacted by the substantial reduction in AOCI of about $1.3 billion, worth 110 basis points of CET1 relative to the fourth quarter as we saw a significant and historic quarter-on-quarter movement in long-end rates, particularly in the belly of the curve.  For instance, the rise in the 5-year U.S. treasury of roughly 120 basis points was the largest in the last 30 years. Taken together, the increase in RWA, coupled with a meaningful reduction in AOCI, partially offset by about 35 basis points of earnings accretion, net of dividends, drove the decrease in our CET1 ratio this quarter.  In contrast, first quarter Tier 1 leverage was down only slightly to 5.9%, mainly driven by the substantial decrease in AOCI, reflecting a significant change in the interest rate environment and a stable balance sheet.  While capital return remains an explicit priority for us, and we recognize its important to our shareholders, given this $1.3 billion move in AOCI related to higher interest rates, we no longer expect to resume our share repurchase program in the second or third quarter as we operate with a conservative balance sheet philosophy.  Given the volatility in rates and the possibility of further significant increases, we are in the process of taking several actions to reduce AOCI risk by about half. This primarily includes shifting additional AFS securities to HTM as well as shortening the portfolio duration through swaps lowering extension risk and consciously allowing some portfolio runoff. Some of these latter actions can be reversed in the future when we choose to reinvest at higher rates.  Turning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our first quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our financial performance, which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our businesses. Total fee revenue was up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher management fees, FX trading, software and processing fees and other fee revenues. Expenses were well-controlled and were held roughly flat year-on-year, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model.  Next, I would like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter outlook and some of our economic assumptions as we look out over the year. At a macro level, while we know that rate assumptions have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests a year-end Fed funds rate of 2.5%. In terms of second quarter of 2022, we expect overall fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis, with servicing fees up about 1% and management fees up 2% to 3%, assuming equity markets remain flat to March 31 levels for 2Q and some downward normalization in FX trading revenues.  In terms of some of our newer fee revenue line items that we started to disclose this quarter, we would not expect to see a repeat of the size of on-premise renewals in the front office software line nor the positive equity investment markups in the other revenue line in 2Q. Regarding NIIs, we now expect 2Q NII to increase 7% to 9% sequentially, which will be driven by the expected Fed rate hikes, partially offset by the AOCI mitigating portfolio actions that I outlined earlier. For full year 2022, we now expect to see year-on-year NII growth of around 18% to 20% and depending on Fed actions and rate moves as well as the shape of our portfolio.  Turning to expenses. We remain laser-focused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs. We expect that second quarter expenses ex-notable items will be up around 2% to 3% on a sequential quarter basis, excluding notable items and seasonal compensation of expenses of $208 million. On taxes, we expect that the 2Q '22 tax rate will be around 20%. We continue to expect to deliver on our goals of margin expansion and positive total and fee operating leverage for the year.  And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Eric. And operator, we can now open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have our first question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Eric, just a follow-up on all things related to the rate environment. Just wondering, first of all, on the commentary about considering some alternatives with regards to the Brown Brothers deal. Can you elaborate what that might mean? Is that potentially some type of -- that thing you might have to fix on the capital side? Or is that related to just timing and deal structure? Any help there would be appreciated. Eric Aboaf : Ken, it's Eric. No, capital from a capital perspective, we're quite comfortable with closing. We've got almost 12% capital ratios today. We've got a very, I think, smooth path to being prepared for a close from a capital perspective. The modifications we're talking about are just around the underlying structure of the transaction. And you've seen this done from time to time before. But we're working through legal entity and subsidiary structure, the exact transfer of systems and third-party contracts. Some of the transition servicing agreements, those kind of structure and modifications that we think will make this a cleaner process and be favorable on several fronts. Kenneth Usdin : And then is there any updated thoughts about general zone of what you might think about for potential closing? Eric Aboaf : As Ron had said, the regulatory review process has taken a bit longer. We've obviously been heavily engaged in that process because of some of the modifications that we're working through jointly with Brown Brothers leadership team. We're deeply in the process of getting additional and refined submissions in. Those will take several months for review and further dialogue. I think you have a sense for how this plays out. And that's why in the prepared remarks, I think Ron described that we expect those reviews to come through during the third quarter. I think at that point, we obviously then sprint to a close. And depending on exactly what month and what week those come through, then we look for -- you take out the calendar, you look at the weekends and do the usual, how do we now just close, but we've got to always close carefully, just given the usual financials and controls that you want to be mindful of. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. And just -- I guess I'll ask a starter one on NII and then leave it to others. But just can you -- do you know just the impact related to the restructuring type of actions versus what you might have thought for NII? Eric Aboaf : There's a range of that. I think you've seen us guide to NII up for the quarter of up 7% to 9%. And that on a year-on-year basis is actually going to be quite nice. I think it's -- is it worth a percentage 0.2 or 0.3. It's those kinds of, I think, adjustments that we're willing to make so that we both run an appropriate portfolio in what could be a highly volatile rate environment, including another possibility of rates could move another 50, 100 basis points, and we want to have a portfolio that can withstand that. And to be honest, we're willing to take a few percentage points of NII growth off the table on a sequential basis to do that. So I think it's a balance, but that's the range. And even with some of those adjustments, a lot of what we'll be doing is in the move from AFS to HTM, which is not NII impacting. There are others on the margin that are, but that's kind of the range that I'd share with you. Operator : Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : So the SEC wants to implement T+1 by the end of next year. I saw the comment letters, including yours. My personal opinion is nobody is ready for it in the industry. So I'm curious why the move from T+2 to T+ -- I'm sorry, T+3 to T+2 was kind of easy and T+2 to T+1 everybody seems to be pushing back. Is it the complexity and shorter time horizon? Is the money to spend on the technology? It's just a little weird to me. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Glenn, it's Ron. Why don't I take that? I mean I think that if you look back in history, everybody has resisted these moves to some degree because it does involve some spending of money and changing in systems and all that. We've spent a fair amount of time on this and thought about this and have been in conversations with regulators and it will be an added burden, but we don't think it's something the industry can't get done in a reasonable amount of time. So I'm not -- I haven't read other people's comment letters. I know how we've thought about it. So we think it will be one of these things like a LIBOR, if you will, more recent history, that will take a lot of time, take a lot of effort, but it's certainly not something that's going to, in our mind, sideline us or sideline other major players. Operator : Our next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : Just a sort of a clarification here. The expense guide, Eric, that was plus 2% to 3% quarter-over-quarter and -- but we're supposed to x out the seasonality, right? So do we back out -- what exactly is the right base that we're supposed to -- do we take the $2,318 million and then back out the $208 million and then grow that? Eric Aboaf : Let me just open up the slide. So I think you're doing it, Brennan, in line with how we've described it. Yes, you can take the first on Slide 11 of the slide deck that $2.318 billion of expenses. That includes the seasonal expenses, which are on the footnote, right, of $208 million, you can pull that out and then you can add 2% to 3% sequentially and get an estimate for second quarter. That's correct. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Okay. And then thinking about the deposits. What -- when you were talking about the decline in deposits, you flagged a normal seasonality, which would suggest that there wasn't anything that's unusual that you've been seeing, but we've started to see rates back up in the market. The policy hikes -- we already see 1 policy hike, likely to see quite a pace here in the next few meetings, how is dialogue with your customers? What are your expectations, updated expectations around deposit action? And do you have any kind of estimate about where you might think you could see deposit growth or runoff end up shaking out here in the -- at least next quarter or two. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Sure, Brennan. For the time being, we've seen little movement in deposits other than a little bit of seasonality, a little bit of currency translation has also played through. But this is all within the bounds of what we'd expect. And we've obviously been watching deposits carefully across currency pools and across client segments. And for the time being, it's been flattish, regardless of which way we look at it. As we go forward, we like many others have tried to guesstimate, and I use the word guesstimate not estimate, the level of shift in deposits, movement of deposits that we'll see with the amount of quantitative tightening that the Fed has announced. And I guess the best context I have for you and others is if we go back to the kind of pre-COVID era, we've grown our deposit base since then by $60 billion to $70 billion. We've also increased our AUC/As by about 25% during that time period. And because of those quarterly, we estimate that about half of the increase of $30 billion to $35 billion has come from the quantitative easing as the Fed extended the sedan the other central banks primarily that expanded its balance sheet by effectively $3 trillion. And so we see that reversing over time with the rough math being for every $1 trillion of balance sheet, we'd expect a $6 billion to $10 billion runoff in our deposits. And they started in May or June, we'll see exactly when they get going at their announced pace. Yes, you could see a little trickle down, we think, in the fourth quarter and then the kind of the $6 billion to $10 billion per year after that.  So that's our guesstimate. We're obviously plus with deposits, and we're happy to be plus with deposits as rates drive. So we'll monetize them for the time being. But that's our guess right now. The other factors are how the interest rate hikes play out. We expect betas to be similar, but they're never exactly the same as they are before. And so we'll be sharply focused there. So those are some of the moving parts in some of our thinking at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Last year, you announced State Street Digital. And I wanted to get a sense as to how that's going relative to expectations. What you've been able to execute on there? And what your clients are asking you to do more of? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. They've had a lot going on, Betsy. Maybe I'll focus on that last question first because this is a very client-intensive decision and spending a lot of time on it. I think the single biggest thing clients are asking for is help with the kind of a comprehensive regulatory framework. This is particularly acute in the U.S., the lack of guidance and the lack of -- really an agreed upon framework is has left a lot of uncertainty and see what institutions can do, particularly banks. So that's out there. I think most of it, though, beyond that, Betsy, would be around and where we're spending a lot of time is, firstly, around enabling clients to invest in digital assets. And that's not just the trading of them, but it's the movement of them. It's the control of them. It's the custody of them, that's a portfolio accounting of them. So it's really, if you think about what we do now for digital assets, tokens, coins, et cetera. I think the other very large thing that the group is focused on, which it's less about external products and much more about how does State Street itself move into a digitalized world more than it is already? And what does it mean for the core operations such as custody, securities movement and control, which is really about, for lack of a better term, the next stage of digitalization. We are working a lot with the major players in the industry because these ecosystems are forming. And in some cases, we actually want to be a very integral part of the ecosystem and in other cases, we actually want to access that. So there's quite a bit going on there. is where I would summarize my answer to you. Betsy Graseck : And would you say that -- yes, go ahead. Eric Aboaf : And Betsy -- it's Eric. I was just going to add. The other thing we're doing is, obviously, where clients, especially institutional clients have added crypto holdings within their fund, right? We're effectively providing some of the services you'd expect. And so we've gone through the -- across our client base. They have about 73 funds, I think, at that count with $0.5 billion of crypto exposure, we're effectively record keeping, right, those assets as part of their underlying funds. And then I think more broadly, where clients are developing specific ETFs and exchange-traded products, that's where we are in an industrious way signing them up for the administration and recordkeeping because that, in a way, is our view as one of the next land grabs because as the ETF and ETP products that comes of age, that's where we'll see some significant inflows. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And would you say you're at scale for these offerings? Or there's more investment to do to get to scale? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. I mean, I think where we are now is of adequate scale, but one would expect that more scale will be required. But as much excitement as there is around this, it's still a relatively small proportion of total investment assets. So I think we're at adequate scale. I think the focus now is more on how do we think about additional capabilities growing. Betsy Graseck : Yes. No, I totally get that. But as CBD fees come through, it's going to be critical to have this infrastructure -- central bank digital currencies. Operator : Next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Just back to BBH, just on that timing of closing one more time. I guess potentially could move into the fourth quarter. Just -- is it safe to say that you think this would certainly close before year-end? And is there any risk to it not closing under without changing the terms dramatically. And is it mostly the U.S. regulatory side as opposed to non-U.S? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. I mean, Brian, the regulatory environment is uncertain, probably gotten more so over the last couple of years been less so, but we are making progress. It is taking longer than we anticipated. We're in dialogue. So it's not like there's -- we're not doing anything or there's silence on all this. We're in a fair amount of dialogue and working the kind of the restructuring that we referred to earlier is explicitly aimed at trying to accelerate this that we view speed is of the essence here. But there's a fair amount of uncertainty. So as I said in my prepared remarks, and Eric just reiterated, what we're targeting at this point and assuming that there'll be a -- this review will get done in the third quarter. And then as Eric noted, the actual -- once the review is done, the close itself isn't going to take a lot of time. I mean everything is ready. The money is in place. There's been a fair amount of integration planning, but it really is around the uncertainty of both the timing and the outcome of these regulatory reviews. And yes, it's mostly -- right now, the open ones are mostly the U.S. banking regulators. We've received lots of approvals from around the world, both from financial services regulators and the antitrust regulators globally. So I don't want to minimize what has been done. But this is one of those things that may be not done until the last one is done. Brian Bedell : Yes. That makes sense. That's great color. And then just on the -- maybe on the deposit side again. So obviously, Ron, BBH gave you pretty good capability to bring on incremental deposits, and I know it's getting pushed out a little bit. But maybe, Eric, if you want to just -- if you can sort of update us on your thoughts or just reconfirm your original thoughts about the level of BBH deposits that would be coming on if it were to close today, for example, and then your appetite for bringing more deposits on, I think it was up to $20 billion of additional deposits at some point. Maybe just to talk about how you're thinking about that, if there's any change in that thought process other than the delay? And is the core BBH fundamentals right now, I assume, at least on the interest side, those are probably tracking better given the additional Fed hikes since the last guide. Eric Aboaf : Ryan, it's Eric. We've been pleased as we've been monitoring and working closely with Brown Brothers on the business, the business performance. It's -- it had a good finish last year. It's had a performance in the first quarter that's within the bands that we had expected. And obviously, there's a little bit of NII tailwind in there, offset by a little bit of equity market, a downtick. But it's a -- business is performing well. We're -- we continue to be excited about it. And the partners, the 9 partners that have been operating that business that are coming over to us are doing a fine job as we'd expect, which is really, really nice to see.  In terms of the deposits and the close and the assets and the modifications and the broader questions. You're asking about the underlying economics of the transaction. I'm not going to go into detail on that at this point. I think Ron in his prepared remarks affirmed that the economics are sound that they'll be accretive within the first year. And what I'd tell you is, as we work through the modifications, which is oftentimes a legal entity kind of structure where we in the finance and treasury side are working very closely with our legal colleagues to navigate those modifications and make sure that they preserve the economic and the accretion that we're looking for. And so we continue to be positive, and we think it will be positive for shareholders. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Eric, can you share with us -- I think you -- in your comments when you were talking about the CET1 ratio that you used the temporary allocation of additional RWA to capture some market business that generated some better revenues for you in the quarter. Can you elaborate on that? And if you pull back, does that mean in the second quarter, the RWA capital that was allocated would decline, meaning the -- all other things being equal, your CET1 ratio could bump up a little bit. Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it's Eric. That's the -- those are the kinds of scenarios and I'll say, navigation that we do for our capital ratios, and they are sometimes dependent on market opportunities, whether it's the FX trading desk here in the U.S. or abroad, whether it's the sec finance unit or sometimes even the lending unit, there -- we're in close partnership with them around on one hand, they are a sophisticated operating within their limits and sometimes they come by, and we have real I think, constructive commercial discussions about, hey, if there's a little more capacity at the top of the house, can that be put to use? And that's where we were this quarter. And you saw we had quite a nice uptick in FX trading revenues up 20% quarter-on-quarter, which I think had not been anticipated was facilitated as we gave them larger limits, partly because we're sitting on an abundance of capital right now.  I think what you will see is that we'll do that selectively. We'll probably do that for another couple of months. We'll see how we're feeling towards June. We would like to keep our RWA asset levels at or below where we are today. So we do expect them to be within those boundaries. And so we'll selectively work through it. But part of the discipline here is we also want to make sure that there's real incremental revenues that we can bring to bear if we're going to deploy the incremental capital and that was the scenario this quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Very helpful. And then, Eric, I know it's not a giant number, but you touched on it in the outlook regarding the adjustments and the fair value adjustments to equity investments were up so strong in Q1 -- in Q1 versus both the fourth quarter and the year ago quarter. How big of a portfolio is that? And was it private equity investments? Can you maybe give us a little more color there? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Sure, Gerard. These are primarily or primarily almost exclusively minority investment opportunities and investments that we've made in a series of companies over the years. There's 5 to 10 of them that are in the crypto space, sometimes providing software, sometimes providing infrastructure, sometimes providing different capabilities. There are some in the more classic technology areas where we've invested over time, again, in minority positions that help facilitate some AI capabilities and capacities that have helped us with our automation and engineering efforts, and so there's a group of them. But we're primarily -- we're not trying to build an investment portfolio. What we have is investments, typically of $5 million, $10 million, maybe $15 million in early to mid-stage companies. Oftentimes, they are companies that are providing a utility type service for multiple large banks.  So we're in there with sometimes the other G-SIBs or an international bank or what have you. And so we get -- effectively -- they get -- the entity gets a network effect for multiple banks, and we participate because we get upside in some of the services. So we're doing it to help facilitate primarily either revenue growth, automation capability or just general capabilities to build up our product set. And the -- I guess, the knock-on benefit of that is because we know this market space well. These tend to appreciate over time. And it's one of the ways we've been driving, I think, innovation would probably be the broader word to use. And we've made some -- I think this particular quarter, we saw a couple of these really appreciate, which is good to see. Operator : And our next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Just, Eric, any -- you updated the guidance on NII for the full year. Any change to the expense or fee revenue guidance that you gave in the prior quarter for the full year? Eric Aboaf : Jim, I didn't go that far, partly because the market environment has just been volatile whether it's equity markets, whether it's rate hikes. And so there's a number of drivers that are moving around. I think NII, we felt just because the Fed forecast were so explicit between the dot plot and the new consensus that we should just describe that for all of you. But the other lines, we think it's still early to go through. It's still early to really call what the equity markets will do, both in the U.S. and internationally, where they've been more depressed. We'll obviously navigate and adjust our expenses to some extent as we go through the year. I think what we did do as part of the outlook commentary after I finish the quarterly description was a firm that we're committed to both positive total operating leverage and positive fee operating leverage. And so I think that gives you some boundaries that we're working within. James Mitchell : Right. Maybe just one curious question on Series Finance. I appreciate the balances are down, specials are down, and those are important factors. But I've always thought that spreads on sec lending were kind of the spread between -- you benefited from a steepening at the short end of the curve. I didn't really seem to see any of that benefit in the spreads. Is that to come? Or we just not thinking about that right? How should I think about security lending spreads, excluding specials and volume? Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think directionally, you're right, it tends to have some correlation. And I think what we find though is that the special activity and the mix of -- the underlying mix of assets that are being borrowed or lent tend to be a little more dominant in terms of their effects on the P&L in a given quarter. So it's -- that has a piece to the rate environment, but it tends to be the volumes and the mix that dominates. Operator : Next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Blostein : Maybe just taking a step back for a second. And when you sort of think through the capital mitigating factors and the steps you guys have taken to sort of the capital position here ahead of BBH closing. When you think on a multiyear basis and maybe sort of lessons learned from the move in interest rates and effect that had on your guidance capital position this quarter and maybe after. What is the more appropriate mix of kind of cash, securities and loans for us to think about over time as well as just the duration of the securities portfolio? How much of that will look different perhaps as we look forward? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Eric? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Alex, it's a good question in a way we've not been in this environment for 20 or 30 years, right, where rates either are going to move quickly to the upside or maybe move quickly to the upside and stay high either. I think there are a couple of thoughts that we've developed over time. I think the first is that the more we can add lending assets, classic loans to our balance sheet, they have to be high quality, but the more we can add lending to the mix of the asset side of the balance sheet, the better off we are. And you've seen us -- you've seen us consistently grow our lending book 10%, 12%. It's just -- it's off of a small base. So that's an area we'll continue to evolve in. I think given that, that will though take some time.  The other elements here is what kind of investment portfolio do you run? We -- just because of our trust and custody heritage, believe it should be a high-quality, pristine one that is unassailable. And our perspective as we do that is I think we're more comfortable putting more of that over time into HTM just because it's an accounting convention that while you all can read through in our 10-Ks and Qs, what the underlying market doesn't immediately -- or doesn't affect the capital ratios. The one governor on that, and you'd say, well, why not put it all in HTM and put it in the drawer, is that in a down rate environment, which typically happens when the Fed moves into intervene on a recession, you tend to get an appreciation of securities, and you want to be able to monetize or take advantage of that to offset whether it's credit or reserve builds. And so that's one of the reasons why you don't want to put all of it in HTM. And the other reason is, if you're -- if rates are flattish or moving within a band of 25 basis points here, 50 basis points there. The AFS convention allows you to rebalance, to adjust your position a little shorter, a little longer. And that's beneficial. And I think over time, we found that that's been additive to our NII and P&L. And so I think over time, you'll probably see us put more in HTM, but not -- there are some limits to that. But that's some of the ways we're thinking about it. And then I guess there's a last layer, which is what's the composition. And I think you've seen us adjust the mix of treasuries, MBS, CMOs. Because we're such a global bank, the foreign sovereigns, especially as euro and international rates rise, I think we'll over time become a bigger part of what we do to grow. So there's a bit of, I think, the mix, the composition will evolve as well over time. Alexander Blostein : Got it. All right. That's helpful. And then maybe a little bit more of a tactical near-term question. When we look through the NII guide, just extrapolating the full year from the second quarter, I guess how surprisingly the benefits of subsequent rate hikes seem to have a smaller effect on NII. But curious how you guys are thinking about deposit beta assumptions beyond sort of the first 100 basis points. Maybe looking at the U.K. market as kind of lessons learned there a little bit further ahead of us, I guess, on the hike in terms of both pricing and client behavior. Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think the first 100 basis points, I think, are a little bit easier to read to your point, like the first rate hike, the beta as we generally assume are in the 20% range. So that's the first 1 or 2. So that's comfortable and pleasing, I guess, I should say. Once you get to the third and fourth you're now floating up in betas in the 30% to 45% range, and this is where it kind of depends. And then I think once you get past the first 4 or 5 hikes, you are looking at sequential quarter betas in the 60% range. I think you're just -- that's just what happens. And to be honest, we're -- we want to go back to a position where the NII is healthy. The NII can support the preferred security stack that we should run from a capital perspective, but we also want to be fair and thoughtful with our clients in the embedded sharing that's been a partnership here for decades and decades with them. So that's what we're looking at and thinking.  You never know how the speed of rate hikes affects that. Some of that's been taken into account in some of those guesstimates that's given to you, but I use the word again, guesstimates here, not estimates because we think these cycles aren't perfectly comparable. And some amount of quantitative tightening has been factored into some of our thinking here as well. But that will have an effect.  And then I think the last one that we'll have to see is depending on how the macro economy does, whether it's if the economy -- if rates move up another 100, 200, 300 basis points and the macro economy is strong, then there's a lot of demand for lending. And so there's this big ask between deposits to fund loans. If you have a slowdown in the kind of real economy, then there's not as much lending that's going to be done and that's more beneficial to deposit rates. So that's another feature that we're keeping a close eye on. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So Eric, I was hoping to ask a multipart question on the capital impact of BBH and how that maybe informs the buyback cadence from here. So as we think about the pro forma impact to your capital ratios, if we were to assume the deal closes in the next quarter or 2, and we shut off the buyback through the third quarter. Given the large pro forma capital hit, I believe it's about $3.5 billion from goodwill and deal intangibles, so about 120 bps of Tier 1 leverage. Your ratio exiting 3Q would still shake out below your lower bound of 5.25%, meaningfully below, but somewhere close to 5%. I just wanted to confirm if the $3.5 billion capital drawdown from BBH all in is the right level for us to be contemplating for modeling purposes. And as we think about the buyback cadence, if you're still running at or below that lower band. And how quickly should we be thinking about you getting -- returning to normal course payout target roughly 80%. Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think the -- it's probably a little bit easier to think about it in CET1 terms. But the translation is kind of the CET1 divided by 2 gives you the leverage. And remember, on leverage, especially in these economic times, we certainly want to stay within the target range of 5.25% to 5.75%. But I've been on record saying getting closer to -- as long as you stay in the 5%, leverage is quite comfortable given that it's not a risk-sensitive measure. If you then pivot back to CET1, we're at almost 12% relative to the target range of 10% to 11%. So there is an almost 200 basis point spread there of excess capital that we have.  If you then fast forward and let's say it's -- we've had a discussion on this call is exactly what we should assume. But if we were to assume a third quarter close, for example, the way to think about it is the goodwill and intangibles for the Brown Brothers transaction is about $3.3 billion. I think if you translate that into CET1, it's just below the 300 basis point mark. So the comparison is, we would prefer, it's not absolutely required, but we prefer to have about 300 basis points of capital to close it. We've got about 200 basis points today. And then the logical way you think about how do you get from here or there over the next 2 quarters, is actually pretty straightforward, right? On one hand, we accrete capital net of the dividend. That's worth about 35 basis points a quarter, so you got 70 there. And on the other hand, as we talked about earlier, we've been deploying our excess capital through the RWA lines, right, through the risk-weighted assets. And we can easily rein in risk-weighted assets by $5 billion or more which creates another 30, 40, 50 basis points of capital as part of a closing process. So there's good levers here, and that's why I said earlier from a capital perspective, it's a comfortable closing process and plan. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Michael Mayo : I just want to make sure I understood what you said on the call. So on the one hand, you're still guiding for positive operating leverage for 2022. You still expect a higher pretax margin. Your backlogs are up. So that's all good. I guess just to clarify your answer just now, the Brown Brothers acquisition all else equal, reduces your CET1 ratio by how much in basis points? Eric Aboaf : Just shy of just around 300 basis points, Mike. Michael Mayo : Okay. And so you're at 11.9% now. So if you close the deal now, you'd be below the low end of your target. So are you delaying the deal because of lack of capital? Or I didn't understand why the delay in the deal. Eric Aboaf : No, it has nothing to do with capital. If we had been in a position to close it now, we would have arranged -- we would not have deployed $5 billion, maybe even $10 billion of RWA, and we would have had a comfortable close of the deal. It's not about capital. It's about as we described earlier, the underlying regulatory process just taking more time. Michael Mayo : Okay. And then as it relates to the lack of resumption of buybacks, is that solely due to the timing of the closing of the deal? Eric Aboaf : I guess, it's -- we're just factoring it in, right? We're -- because of where we are on the regulatory process, it's -- we're estimating a potential third quarter close and to just navigate comfortably with capital. Because we had that large AOCI hit of $1.3 billion and I usually buy back almost for almost $500 million of shares per quarter, right? That would be my usual cadence that AOCI hit has effectively put us in a position where it's best not to do those 2 quarters worth of buybacks during the second and third quarter. Michael Mayo : All right. That's clear. And then lastly, your guidance for positive operating leverage, how much do fee waivers contribute to that? Is that like all of it or 10% or 50% or -- just roughly. Eric Aboaf : It's -- well, the guidance is to positive total operating leverage and fee operating leverage. I think the -- if I just try to do the math quickly, but the IR team can probably help you offline, Mike. This quarter, we had fee waiver impacts of 10%, and then we won't have any fee waivers for the rest of the year. Last year, we had fee waivers, I can only remember the second half of the year because I'm trying to remember when it started in the $20 million per quarter range. So -- on our total fees of $10 billion, I don't know, rough estimate, maybe about 0.5 point of fee operating leverage is caused by the tailwind absence of money market fee waivers. But that's -- I'm doing mental math without even a pencil and paper in front of me. So maybe we could follow up with you offline, but maybe in that order of magnitude at least. Michael Mayo : I think I have. I mean so in terms of ZIP code, most of it does not relate to the fee waivers. There's the lion's share of it. So I think I got it. Eric Aboaf : That's correct. It's real underlying momentum. Operator : And our next question is from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous. Robert Wildhack : Just on fee revenue in the quarter, how would you describe about organic growth there? Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Yes. I mean, Rob, why don't I start, it's Ron. I mean kind of several now good organic growth quarters, both on the servicing line and the management fee line. I think that if you think about last year, there was -- in the servicing line, a fair amount of that would have been in Alpha front to back. A lot of that now is being installed, and a big chunk of that is what you see in the $2.9 trillion. The growth that, or at least the sales that we reported on the servicing fee line were kind of disproportionately in the traditional back office business, which is highly scaled and relatively quick to install. So we like that mix. And then management fees have been, as Eric noted, it's been across the board in the core businesses. It's ETFs, Institutional and even a little bit of Cash. So we like both the level of it. I mean you always like more, but we like the level of it. But as importantly, we like the diversity of it. Robert Wildhack : Okay. And then on the $2.9 trillion to be installed, can you just remind us of the timeline for when that gets installed and when it starts to hit revenue? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Rob. It's Eric. We've said that that begins to get installed this -- remember, the bulk of that, there were 2 very large deals that were announced in second and third quarter last year. Those were $1 trillion-plus deals. And then there's obviously a set of kind of smaller and midsized activities. For those 2 large deals, they are complex and they're transformational, right, for those clients and what we're delivering. And so those we've said take tend to take a little longer. They're closer to the -- I think we've said for installation to installations range from kind of 6 months to 36 months. But for those were the middle ground is probably 24 to 30. So right now, our estimated is that a good piece, but probably not the majority begins to get installed by late this year. And then this is really a 2023 lift of revenue. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn it back to our CEO, Ron O\u2019Hanley for closing remarks. Ronald O\u2019Hanley: Well, thanks very much. Thank you all for joining us. I know it was a busy day for you, so we appreciate your time and questions. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call and webcast. Thank you for participating and have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",

Please go ahead, Ilene. Ilene Fiszel Bieler : Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O\u2019Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2022 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to 2 questions and then requeue. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts 1 or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation. In addition, today\u2019s presentation will contain forward-looking statements.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good afternoon, everyone. This morning, we released our second quarter financial results. The second quarter operating environment continued to be impacted by the ongoing geopolitical events in Europe and the notable macroeconomic environment. The associated price and wage inflation, rising interest rates, years of recession are driving declining equity in fixed income markets, currency volatility and concerns over market liquidity. These factors created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our businesses. Despite the adverse market conditions, State Street performed well in the second quarter with a strong balance sheet and good sales momentum while delivering strong FX trading and significantly better NII growth year-over-year, coupled with well-controlled expenses and a healthy pretax margin. We remain focused on executing against our strategy and intensely managing what we can control to navigate through uncertainty, drive further business momentum and achieve our medium-term goals. Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance. 2Q \u201822 EPS decreased 8% year-over-year, though it was down just 2% year-over-year, excluding notable items, primarily a prior year gain on sale in 2Q \u201821. Weaker markets were the major driver of this decline. Total fee revenue for the quarter declined 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees and the stronger U.S. dollar. Within total fee revenue, our Global Markets franchise continued to perform well with FX trading services revenue increasing market volatility, which drove higher spreads. Total revenue for the quarter declined 3% year-over-year, but was down just 1%, excluding notable items as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a strong NII result which increased 25% relative to the year ago period. In the face of market-related fee revenue headwinds in the second quarter, we remain highly focused on controlling the expense base. Second quarter total expenses were flat year-over-year and declined 1% excluding notable items. Our ongoing productivity actions largely offset higher-than-anticipated salary increases and planned business investments. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see across the middle of the slide. We reported a strong quarter of new AUC/A asset servicing wins, which amounted to $972 billion with back office services accounting for 40% of these wins by AUC/A. As a result of this quarter\u2019s good sales performance, AUC/A won but yet to be installed increased to a record $3.6 trillion at quarter end. During the second quarter, we also reported another Alpha client win, with 12 of State Street\u2019s 20 Alpha clients now live as of quarter end. We were also awarded the title of Security Services Provider of the Year in the Financial News 20th Annual Trading and Technology Awards. Front office software and data also experienced good business momentum in the second quarter, with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to $251 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled $3.5 trillion at quarter end. Overall second quarter AUM inflows were negatively impacted by the weaker equity market environment but we still saw positive net inflows into both our cash and U.S. low-cost ETF franchises during the quarter. Even in a volatile environment, we continue to innovate and expand our capabilities to drive future growth. For example, Global Advisors continues to press forward in active ETFs and ESG as illustrated by the launch of the actively managed SPDR Nuveen Municipal Bond ESG ETF and a number of MSCI Climate Paris Aligned ETFs. Last, in terms of business momentum, I was particularly pleased to see that State Street was recognized as the top provider in FX services by Euromoney Magazine in the second quarter. Importantly, State Street regained its 1 position overall for real money clients in addition to being ranked 1 for best service for real money clients. Our FX franchise supports and complements our core investment services business and has proven to be an effective deployment of our capital. Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio improved significantly to 12.9% at quarter end due to our active management of risk-weighted assets and the mitigating actions we executed in our investment portfolio in the second quarter. The strength of our balance sheet was highlighted in the second quarter with the release of the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which we announced our intention to increase State Street\u2019s quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.63 per share in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We were pleased to announce the intended increase to our quarterly common dividend as we recognize the importance of capital return to our shareholders. With that in mind, in the fourth quarter of this year, it remains our intention to resume our existing common share repurchase program in an amount reflecting interest rate levels and market conditions at that time. I\u2019ll now turn to our proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services business which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We continue to be excited about the business and its people, the franchise it represents and the opportunities the transaction represents for our collective clients, and for accelerating our strategy. I\u2019ve mentioned previously that we\u2019ve been engaged in ongoing dialog with U.S. banking regulators regarding the regulatory review process and potential modifications to the transaction intended to facilitate resolution of that process. Based on those discussions, we have developed with BBH, proposed modifications to the transaction structure that the parties believe present a path forward. The proposed modifications include changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and changes to the regulatory approvals required to complete the transaction. As part of the proposed modified transaction, State Street is seeking amendments to the transaction terms, including the purchase price. Both BBH and our Board of Directors would need to review and approve the modified transaction in amended terms. During the third quarter, we intend to finalize the proposed structure and contractual terms and confirm our approach with regulators. Assuming the financial and operational aspects of the proposed modifications are timely finalized and contracted, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions, the parties are aiming to close the transaction at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. However, there exists significant timing uncertainty and risk that closing will extend beyond that time line. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be entered into or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for this modified transaction. After September 6, 2022, either party can terminate the transaction without penalty, absent further agreement of the parties. To conclude, as we progress towards our medium-term targets in this uncertain environment, we remain particularly focused on maintaining and further improving our pretax margin performance, which despite the challenging market conditions, increased almost 29% for the quarter, excluding notable items. To help achieve this goal, in the face of inflationary pressure and a challenging revenue environment, we will continue to exhibit expense discipline and to drive our automation and productivity efforts. We also remain laser-focused on innovating for the benefit of our clients and driving organic growth, as demonstrated by the strong AUC/A wins in the second quarter, all while returning capital to our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll begin my review of our second quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.91 or $1.94 excluding acquisition and restructuring costs as detailed on the panel on the right side of the slide. As Ron noted earlier, the operating environment in the second quarter remained challenging, largely characterized by continued market volatility related to macroeconomic events and continued geopolitical uncertainties. As you can see on the left panel of the slide, strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter that impacted other fee areas. Also evidenced by today\u2019s results, our approach to expense management remains very disciplined and deliberate. On a year-on-year basis, second quarter expenses were down even as we experienced higher-than-expected wage increases and continue to thoughtfully invest in the franchise. Lastly, you\u2019ll see that in the second quarter, we had a lower-than-expected tax rate. The bulk of the discrete tax items that contributed to our lower taxes were due to the reassessment of a deferred tax asset worth roughly $60 million. All things considered during the quarter, our business model demonstrated resilience against the challenging backdrop. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period-end AUC/A decrease by 10% on a year-on-year basis and 8% sequentially. Amidst continued and uncertain economic conditions, the year-on-year change was largely driven by lower period end market levels across just about every equity and fixed income market around the world, partially offset by net new business and client flows. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of the same lower period end market levels, as we\u2019ve also started to see industry outflows from investment products as the risk off sentiment continues. Similarly, at Global Advisors, quarter-end AUM decreased 11% year-on-year and 14%, sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was also largely driven by lower period end market levels and institutional net outflows which was partially offset by positive net inflows in both our U.S. low-cost ETF complex and cash inflows in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you\u2019ll see second quarter total servicing fees down 7% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, normal pricing headwinds, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business growth. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down only 4% year-on-year. I\u2019d also highlight that from a segment perspective, we continue to see excellent revenue growth in our alternative client segment, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 5%, primarily as a result of the same drivers, lower average equity and fixed income market levels, client activity and adjustments and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by positive net new business. Within servicing fees, back office fees were down 7% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle Office Services was down 12% year-on-year and 8% quarter-on-quarter, primarily due to decreased client AUMs, driven by lower market levels and client transaction activity and adjustments. But we are seeing some compression in our legacy middle office book. It is an important component of our Alpha proposition when it connects to both the Front office and Back office and new wins generally come with contracts of 7 to 10 years. We continue to expect to see good growth over the medium term as evidenced by our large uninstalled middle office revenue backlog of more than $90 million, which I will talk more about in a moment. Even against this challenging backdrop, we continue to be pleased with our Investment Services business momentum and robust pipeline. We recorded another strong quarter of new AUC/A wins worth $972 billion while AUC/A won, but yet to be installed amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter end. As Ron mentioned earlier, during second quarter, we reported another new Alpha win, Allspring Global Investments taking the total number of Alpha clients to 20 and now have 12 implementations live. Lastly, in response to industry inflationary cost pressures, we\u2019ve undergone a comprehensive analysis of our pricing across all our product areas. The result of this analysis has led to the decision to begin to adjust our client pricing upwards in certain areas of servicing where the wage pressure is most acute and industry capacity is stretched. Ultimately, we believe these pricing changes will support the continued investment that allows us to best serve our clients. Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter management fees were $490 million, down 3% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, the impact of currency translation and a specific client repricing adjustment, partially offset by the elimination of money market fee waivers and the run rate impact of net ETF inflows. Management fees were down 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds, partially offset by the elimination of the same money market fee waivers. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our franchise remains well positioned for growth. In ETFs, although we saw outflows in equity and commodities, we continue to see inflows into SPDR low cost and fixed income ETFs. In our Institutional Business, there\u2019s continued momentum in our target date franchise, notwithstanding outflows primarily from 1 large client with very low fee assets, which ultimately benefited the overall management fee rate this quarter. Across our cash franchise, we again saw another quarter of strong net inflows, this time worth $15 billion in the quarter, contributing to market share gains. On Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to a period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was up 16%, primarily driven by higher FX spreads, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, FX trading services revenue was down 8% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes too. Our second quarter securities finance revenues decreased slightly year-on-year, primarily driven by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to lower markets, partially offset by higher spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 11%, mainly reflecting higher spreads, partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances. Second quarter software and processing fees were down 11% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by lower Front office software and data revenue associated with CRD, which I\u2019ll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenues of negative $43 million in the second quarter declined both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Both the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter declines largely reflect negative market-related adjustments while the absence of prior period positive fair value adjustments on equity investments also contributed to the sequential decline. While we saw pressure throughout the quarter, almost half of the $43 million came through in the second half of June. Moving to Slide 9. Let me provide some details on the performance of our Front office software and data revenue in the second quarter on the left panel of this slide. As a reminder, CRD represents the majority of these revenues, but we also include Alpha Data Services, Alpha Data Platform and Mercatus revenues since they are part of our Front office offering. On both a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis, Front office software revenue declined as expected, primarily driven by the absence of several on-premise renewals in the prior periods as well as some episodic fees when compared to the prior year quarter, partially offset by higher software-enabled SaaS revenue. It is important to note, however, that the more durable and recurring software-enabled and professional services revenues have continued to grow nicely with a year-on-year growth of 15%, demonstrating success in deploying our cloud-based SaaS platform environment to more clients. Turning to some of the softer metrics enabled by CRD and Alpha on the right panel, you\u2019ll see that our annual recurring revenue has grown 20% year-on-year as we convert more clients to SaaS, which we expect will create a stickier and more profitable business model. As for the middle office, we continue to have an extremely healthy backlog of uninstalled revenue worth $92 million, which is almost twice the prior year. Lastly, we are pleased to have announced another Alpha mandate win this quarter. We\u2019re also excited to have expanded an existing Alpha relationship this quarter, winning approximately $300 billion of new back office assets to custody from an asset owner client. This provides another proof point that our Alpha value proposition is working as we\u2019re gaining more of the wallet share over time. Turning to Slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 25% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and continued growth in loan balances. Relative to the first quarter, NII was up 15%. The sequential increase was largely driven by the improvement in both short and long end rates, which benefited our yields, together with continued growth in loan balances, partially offset by lower investment portfolio balances. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the quarter. Average deposits were down 6% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, primarily related to the impact from currency translation and dollar strengthening, which accounted for almost half of the year-on-year decline and 2/3 of the sequential decline. The investment portfolio is now down modestly, and we have almost 60% of our securities now in held to maturity. We\u2019re pleased that our balance sheet is well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwinds and also protect OCI. Turning to Slide 11. Second quarter expenses, excluding notable items, decreased 1% year-on-year or increased 2% adjusted for currency translation. In response to the revenue environment, we have been proactively managing our expenses, including lowering our incentive compensation, in addition to carefully executing on our continued productivity savings efforts which generated approximately $60 million in year-on-year gross saves or approximately $150 million year-to-date. These savings enabled us to continue to self-fund the good portion of the 4% to 6% higher wage rates we\u2019re facing and the targeted investments in the business, including the Alpha product, technology infrastructure and broader automation. Compared to 2Q \u201821, compensation employee benefits was down 3% as lower incentive compensation, the impact of currency translation were partially offset by salary merit increases associated with wages and inflationary pressure and higher contractor spend. Excluding currency translation, compensation and employee benefits would have been up 1%. Information systems and communications expenses was down 2%, primarily due to the episodic credits related to vendor pricing optimization and infrastructure rationalization. Occupancy was down 4% due largely to currency translation. And other expenses were up 18%, primarily reflecting higher recoverable client-related expenses, which are offset in fee revenue, professional fees and travel costs. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, expenses were down due to seasonal expenses in the first quarter. Headcount increased quarter-on-quarter as we continue to in-source some strategic technology functions from vendors as well as support growth in Alpha. Overall, in light of the current macroeconomic environment, we have had pretty healthy pretax margin for the quarter at approximately 29%, excluding notable items, supported by active expense management and strong NII growth. Moving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We are quite pleased to report CET1 of 12.9%, up 100 basis points happy with our performance under this year\u2019s CCAR with a calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a preliminary SCB at the floor. As a result, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase to our 3Q \u201822 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval, and it remains our intention to again begin our existing common share repurchase program in the fourth quarter in an amount reflecting market conditions at the time. To the left of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. As you can see this quarter, even against the backdrop of a challenging operating environment, we drove stronger and higher capital levels. During the second quarter, we completed several of the previously announced RWA optimization actions across our trading, lending and investment portfolios, reducing RWA $12 billion quarter-on-quarter. We also shifted about $20 billion of AFS securities to HTM. As a result, we limited AOCI from the investment portfolio to under $500 million or 40 basis points of CET1, even with a roughly 60 basis point upward interest rate move across the 2- and 5-year part of the curve. You\u2019ll see a larger AOCI move in the GAAP books, but much of that is ratio hedged and offset by the appreciating dollar effect on RWA with an offsetting goodwill and intangibles as well. Given that we have now significantly reduced the OCI risk to interest rate shocks by 75%, we are now comfortable operating somewhat below our standard target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios. Turning to Slide 13. We provide a summary of our second quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I am pleased with our quarterly performance, which demonstrates the strength of our business model. The current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, notwithstanding, our strong growth in both net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets highlighting the resiliency of our franchise. And our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating the progress we are making in improving our operating model. Now turning to outlook. We would like to provide our current thinking regarding the third quarter. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forward which suggests the year-end Fed funds rate of 3.5%. We expect other major international central banks to continue raising rates, with the ECB expected to start increasing rates in third quarter. The current spot level of global equity markets would imply that average equity markets in 3Q would be down 7% to 8% quarter-on-quarter, and U.S. dollar appreciation to be about 1 percentage point of headwind to revenues and tailwind to expenses, which will be included in our guide. Now in terms of the third quarter of 2022 and on a standalone State Street basis. Given the implied declines in average Global Markets, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 2% on a sequential basis. And we expect both servicing fees and management fees to be down 4% quarter-on-quarter, driven by weaker market levels. Turning to NII. Following 1 of the strongest sequential increases in the NII for many years in 2Q, we expect to deliver further growth with NII expected to increase 5% to 9% quarter-on-quarter, driven by the tailwind from Central Bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some initial deposit outflow and rotation in 3Q. And for the full year, on a stand-alone State Street basis, we expect NII to increase 24% to 27%, which is significantly better than our prior full year guide of 18% to 20%. Next, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to increase just under 1% quarter-on-quarter, driven by inflationary pressures on wages as we continue to target productivity initiatives and execute against our strategy with a deep focus on expense discipline. This focus enable us to drive positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items for the full year. Lastly, we would expect our 3Q tax rate to be approximately 20% for the quarter. And with that, let me turn the call back to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr of Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. In your prepared remarks, you talked about 2Q management fees driven by markets, other step up, also a client-specific pricing adjustment. I just wondered if you could just give us a little more color on that. So we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a one-off or could be other adjustments going forward? Eric Aboaf : Sorry, Glenn, and sorry you\u2019re breaking up on the audio. Could you -- I got bits of that, but could you repeat that, please, for the...? Glenn Schorr : Absolutely. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned 2Q management fees driven by markets, which is obviously going to happen. But you also said client-specific pricing adjustment. I wonder if you could give a little more detail, say, the size and what kind of adjustment that was just in case we should be thinking about that going forward? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Glenn. Let me try to cover that. And I think you\u2019re focused on servicing fees and management fees. So let me do them both so that we have a little bit of context for you. On Page 6 of the materials on servicing fees, about the impact of client activity and adjustments. And on a year-on-year basis, largely due to the kind of lower levels of activities and sometimes that comes through with lower markets, that was worth about 1 percentage point of headwind on a year-on-year basis and about 2 points on a quarter-on-quarter basis for that. On management fees, there was a series of impacts quarter-on-quarter. Most of that was driven by market. There was 1 client that we called out but that would have been worth at most 1 to 2 percentage points of fees for that quarter. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And then I have just -- I know this would be included in your guidance but I\u2019m looking for a little color. When markets -- I remember when they used to go up all the time, you keep temporary enthusiasm on fee rates -- on fees in general, servicing fees because some contracts have ceilings in them. My question is, if and when we continue any downtrend in these markets, do those same contracts have floors? Should we expect more stable servicing fees if and when the markets continue to drag lower? Ron O\u2019Hanley : Glenn, I\u2019ll take that. You\u2019re accurate. We have a small number. They tend to be very large clients where you just do hit the top of the fee schedule or even in some cases, the fees continued to tail down. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re close to that yet in terms of that being meaningful. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see that being a factor in the near term unless we see a much more significant kind of market downturn. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thank you. Ron O\u2019Hanley : Operator, the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Ron, just following up on your opening remarks and what we saw on the forward-looking statements. Just as you go forward and try to negotiate, I guess, just -- how do you think through your optionality, meaning that, of course, a price concession is probably your best outcome. If you can\u2019t get one, is that a go-not-go decision right there? And then if for some reason, you do walk away one side or the other, what becomes your next immediate steps in terms of either capital strategy or a go-forward strategy? Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley : Yes, Ken, we\u2019re very much in the midst of this. So I don\u2019t want to get out ahead of it. Firstly, we remain committed to the combination on a strategic basis. But given that we foresee this being restructured in a way that it changes some of the operating model, some of the circumstances change. We do believe -- well, we know we believe some kind of a price adjustment would be warranted. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of where we are in discussions with PBH. They remain very amicable and both sides are committed to making this happen. We\u2019re committed to -- we like the business. We like the get there, then there\u2019s a lot of options, and we come back to you at that time. Ken Usdin : Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then secondly, Eric, on your NII update, the new guy. Just wondering how much of that update is a new curve? And if you can help us understand where you are on that? And what are you getting on new securities yields now versus what\u2019s rolling off the back book? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Ken, the uptick in the NII guide, I think probably both for the third quarter and then the full year, which we\u2019ve updated is primarily driven by the higher yield curve and expectations in the U.S. plus some expectation that the ECB is going to start to seriously raise rates in the third quarter. And we\u2019ve said that once the ECB crosses 25 basis point positive rate threshold, that begins to be accretive. So I think those are the major drivers. On investment portfolio yields, I think you see that in our average balance sheet. They are up on average, almost 15 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And you will expect that, that kind of increase will continue to flow through the books. To the question of exactly what a new security comes in at versus an old security rolls out at, I think the best way to estimate that because it will vary by different parts of the book, whether it\u2019s the treasuries, whether it\u2019s the MBS, whether it\u2019s the foreign securities is we\u2019re basically replenishing securities that have an average duration of 2.8 years. So you can kind of see what an older security with that vintage would look like and compare it to what\u2019s in the market today. And you\u2019ll see a nice pickup, and that\u2019s what\u2019s flowing through and giving us the kind of quarter-on-quarter increase on average that you saw this quarter. And we\u2019ll expect to see another increase on average in that order of magnitude in the third quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. First, just on the discussion around the forward look. I wanted to make sure I understood what types of things are being looked to change? Is this a function of you need to keep more data servicing processing within certain countries to satisfy regulatory requirements? Or is there something else that\u2019s more not operational but more around what parts of the business you can do? I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s an expense issue or if it\u2019s a revenue opportunity issue. Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. Those are all the kinds of areas we\u2019re working through. And I think the heart of this when you do a banking deal, a global banking deal, this sort is the legal entity structure. And you obviously know we run a holding company, a bank, a series of banks and there\u2019s a series of entities that we have around the world. And obviously, creating a workable and a good path of combination can be done in different ways. And part of what we\u2019ve been working through is modifications on what might have been our original plan to make the transaction workable and attractive. That then has some ramifications to your point on the operating model that will have some amount of effect on perhaps the pace of expense -- or pace of expense or revenue synergies, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working through. What we have said, and we\u2019d want to reiterate is that we are committed to finding a way to preserve the economic accretion that in the range that we had previously disclosed back in September. And so we\u2019re highly focused on that. And as a result, there are some changes that we\u2019re seeking on the transaction that including price that Ron mentioned. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then you get this in front of regulators but if they don\u2019t agree by September 6, you\u2019ve indicated you want to close by the end of the year. How should investors think about what you\u2019re expected thought process is going to be between that time period September 6 to 31? Ron O\u2019Hanley : Yes. Betsy, it\u2019s Ron. I mean the September 6 date, it\u2019s basically the 1-year anniversary for the deal. And like a lot of transactions, they have an outside limit. So the way you should interpret that is what we\u2019ve said is both parties remain committed. We\u2019ve got to work through things. I mean the regulatory world and the political world has changed significantly since we announced this deal and what we\u2019re looking towards as a way to breakthrough and close it in a reasonable time period, and this time period doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to anybody, but it\u2019s actually better than some of the alternatives that we\u2019ve been faced with. So if you think about the September 6, it\u2019s an existing date. And assuming everything is going along fine and parties are agreeing, then we just agree to an extension of that to the close date. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Ron O\u2019Hanley : Just disclosing and reminding everybody what the terms of the transaction are. Betsy Graseck : Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. And then just last for me, is I think you mentioned that given the restructuring of the balance sheet that you\u2019ve made and the success with that, that you\u2019re now comfortable with running potentially below management targets for CET1 SLR. Could you remind us what the targets are and how much below you\u2019re willing to dip? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. I think the best place to see our capital ratios and targets is on Page 12 of the presentation deck. You see our -- what I\u2019ll call our standard CET1 targets, our 10% to 11% are standard leverage -- Tier 1 leverage targets of 5.25% to 5.75%. And what we\u2019ve done, as you mentioned, is we\u2019ve dramatically reduced the volatility risk from OCI which means that we\u2019re quite comfortable running below that. Directionally, that means on CET1, for example, could be up to 50 basis points below that. While we run at much lower risk and volatility levels in OCI and on a leverage basis, it tends to be about half of the -- of that amount. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : So Eric, you referenced that you were considering some adjustments to the pricing model which make a lot of sense. Obviously, we\u2019re dealing with a very inflationary environment. Have you begun those discussions? And what has been the reaction from clients so far? Are you hearing from some of your clients that some of the competitors are also making similar moves just to be assured that you\u2019re not going to be out on your own pushing in that regard because it\u2019s normally when we think of pricing, of course, in the custody world, we typically -- it\u2019s typically a tougher place to get price increases. So kind of curious about that. Ron O\u2019Hanley : Brennan, it\u2019s Ron. Why don\u2019t I start on this and Eric will fill in. We\u2019re early in this process, but yes, we have been out with clients and walk through our planned price increases with a few clients at this point. And there\u2019s a whole plan as Eric alluded. It\u2019s around the areas where we\u2019ve got the most inflationary pressure which might be specialty areas, areas where there\u2019s limited capacity in the marketplace, areas that are just growing very rapidly. And interestingly, the earliest ones have been in some ways, I think clients were not surprised that it was coming at them. So I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to be. None of us enjoy paying more for something today than what we paid yesterday. But we\u2019re going at this in a very fact-based way. These tend to be sophisticated institutional buyers, and they know what\u2019s going on. So I can\u2019t speak for what others are doing. I just don\u2019t have a feel for that. But we\u2019re running our business in the way we believe we need to. And we think this is an important component of it. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thank you for that. And then when we think about the -- you laid out, Eric, the expectation around ECB and whatnot. But as we see potential policy rates in different parts of the world diverging. Could you give us a reminder about the currency mix of your deposit -- of your deposits as it stands now? And whether or not you expect in the next -- in the foreseeable future, that to shift at all as yield differentials widen between different currencies? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Brennan, it\u2019s Eric. And we actually added some additional disclosure in our addendum, our financial addendum this quarter. You\u2019ll find it on Page 8. That actually breaks out the balance sheet, including the total assets, the investment securities and deposits by the major currencies, USD, euros, pound sterling and so forth because we are quite focused on navigating this interest rate environment. To be honest, securing the benefits of interest rate increases around the world, right? We position the balance sheet currency by currency. We have pricing plans and betas that are carefully developed currency by currency. I don\u2019t think we expect a lot of change in the composition of the balance sheet. I mean, the U.S. is clearly -- the U.S. Central Bank is clearly moving much more quickly, and with not only interest rates, but quantitative tightening. And that will potentially have a downward trend on U.S. currency deposits. On the other hand, with U.S. rates prevailing rates higher than what you see around the rest of the world, there\u2019s a natural draw into the U.S. from global investors. So it\u2019s hard to -- I think it\u2019s hard to actually forecast the currency composition and the deposit levels given those movements. But we\u2019re well prepared. And in fact, some of the interest rate or some of the NII increases that you saw this quarter are coming not only by virtue of the U.S. rate rises, but also those in pound sterling and some of the other Anglo-Saxon currencies. And we\u2019re positioning currency by currency as a result. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. James Mitchell : Eric, maybe just on the securities portfolio. You had a pretty big shift into HTM to derisk the AOCI. But I\u2019m just looking it does have a materially higher yield. Is there something to think about in the HTM portfolio that you\u2019ve kind of locked in longer duration or it\u2019s a little more credit risk in there. How do I think about the HTM portfolio versus AFS and how that can evolve? Does it hold back NII sensitivity or not? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it\u2019s Eric. We\u2019re quite careful about managing our NII sensitivity holistically across the book. I think what you\u2019ll see is that because we use HTM to protect against interest rate and AOCI volatility, it\u2019s more natural that if we have a blended book of short-, medium- and longer-term securities that we would move more of the medium and longer-term securities into HTM because thereby, we get the most protection while we give up the least amount of sale optionality. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re just seeing a higher yield. I think you\u2019ll see that generally be true, and you can follow that in our disclosures accordingly. James Mitchell : Okay. Great. And then when I think about the yet to be installed business, I mean it continues to grow. I know there\u2019s a long tail to getting those installed. But are we at a point where this -- mean I think we\u2019ve looked in the past, and I think we all get a little frustrated that we see these big wins, and it\u2019s hard to determine or see it in the numbers. Are we at a point where this is getting to materiality and that we could see a nice acceleration inorganic growth next year when this stuff gets installed? Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think you\u2019ve got the right broad time frame. I mean the -- I guess the way I would describe it is the larger the deal, the more complex and more transformative it is for our clients, right? That\u2019s the -- they\u2019re fundamentally changing their operating model, they\u2019re harmonizing systems and processes, and we\u2019re co-investing with them to build for them a front, middle and often back-office model that will suit them for a decade or more. As you think about the $3.6 trillion of AUC/A to be installed, 2023 is an important year. We expect that about 1/3. This will move around, but about 1/3 will likely be installed by the end of that year and perhaps as much as half of the revenue associated with those wins. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Eric, if you could just repeat that comment on the 1/3 of the $3.6 trillion. Was that by the end of next year did you say? I just missed that. Eric Aboaf : Yes, that\u2019s correct. By the end of 2023. Brian Bedell : Got it. Just back to the BBH strategy. So good to hear that you\u2019re both committed to this. If it -- if you are able to close it with any amended terms and amended structures, can you just remind us or I guess if you have comments on the deposit strategy, which was obviously bringing the BBH deposits on balance sheet? And then there was an opportunity to bring potentially a large portion of balances over out of -- from their $60 billion of off balance sheet or third-party bank, I should say, arrangements. Is that -- would that still be doable? Or does the structure change that calculus? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re still in the process of nailing down both the legal entity and the operating model changes, and we\u2019re working through those and working towards developing a firm view of when and how the deposit and sweep program is operated, and how we may in the future, use that program, take advantage of some of the cash and deposit optionality. But that\u2019s in process at this point. And we\u2019ll certainly provide an update in the course of the third quarter I expect as we nail down the modifications. Brian Bedell : Yes. That makes sense. And then maybe just excluding BBH and just looking at everything on a State Street-only basis, should we be thinking do you think in this cycle, we should be thinking of deposit runoff to be sort of similar to the last cycle? I think we were down more than 15% in average deposit levels from start of Fed hiking to the trough in 2019. Is that a reasonable starting point to think about that deposit runoff? Or is something different in the cycle that would make you think that you wouldn\u2019t have that? Eric Aboaf : I think the last cycle is always going to be indicative, but you remember, there were moving parts in the last cycle, including the SLR rule was in flux and there was -- we -- many of us on the banking side had to navigate the size of our balance sheet independently what was happening at the interest rate environment and quantitative tightening. I think what I\u2019ve said in the past is relevant over the -- since the kind of the pre-COVID time period, our deposits are up roughly $60 billion. We think that half of that can easily be ascribed to the quantitative easing that we had, and that will reverse out. Now that\u2019s estimated. It\u2019s always hard to forecast this because the interest rate environment is moving up quickly. There is also risk off environment. So we\u2019ve got to see how that plays out. I\u2019ve said that we could see $6 billion to $10 billion of outflows per year per $1 trillion of U.S. balance sheet tightening. I do think because the interest rate environment is higher and has moved faster, right, we\u2019re likely to see closer to the $10 billion per $1 trillion in the first year and then maybe lighten out in the second and third year. But those are all the scenarios we\u2019re working through. I think from our perspective, we\u2019re extremely flushed from a liquidity standpoint. The deposits are valuable, so we\u2019re monetizing them for the purpose of the P&L. And we expect over time to be able to only get to the higher levels of NII that we have in the past. I think we were in the $695 million range with our peak during the last cycle, I think our forecast -- and it\u2019s hard to forecast this perfectly. But the forecast that we\u2019ve built put us at or above that level in this next cycle. And part of that is that while there is some tightening and erosion of total deposit levels, you also have higher U.S. rates, higher global rates and in particular, we\u2019ll have a move in ECB and European rates, at least based on the current forwards. Operator : Sure. Your next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So Eric, I wanted to better understand just some of the guidance items that you outlined specific to both fees and expenses. And on the fee side, certainly, the guys that you offer suggest greater resiliency compared with some of the more acute declines that we\u2019ve seen in some of the market proxies. Just want to get a sense as to what\u2019s driving that better outcome? And specific to expenses, I was hoping you can give some bookends in terms of what range of expense growth we should be contemplating? You cited inflationary pressures multiple times, the need to maybe revisit pricing with some of your clients, but you also have some FX tailwinds. So I was hoping to get some perspective on what sort of expense growth range we should be thinking about for the remainder of this year? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Let me start on fees. The real environmental challenge is if you just extend out the current spot levels of that equity markets are sitting at, the average -- the daily average for third quarter is going to be down 7% to 8% versus the average for second quarter. And that\u2019s the basis by which we earn revenues both in servicing fees and management fees. So that\u2019s the headwind that we have. We\u2019re hoping that some of the market related -- the lumpy sub that we have in other revenues doesn\u2019t repeat and that might give us a little bit of insulation. So that\u2019s why I said servicing and management fees could be down the 4% range sequentially, but total fees, perhaps closer to 2%, So less so. And obviously, volatility levels in markets help currency trading and other activities. But we\u2019ve got to play out and see how the summer months happen. I think on expenses, I\u2019m just trying to guide quarter-by-quarter. I think if you add up first quarter, second quarter, the guide of just under 1 percentage point for the third quarter. And you can put a range around that and estimate fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re -- I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done from a guidance standpoint. I think what we are willing to say is because we have kind of an overall view of fee revenues for third quarter, we can guesstimate into fourth quarter as can you. I think NII, we have quite a solid view of the full year, which we\u2019ve provided. We\u2019re comfortable of saying and we said in our prepared remarks that we expect to drive positive total operating leverage for the year, adjusted for notables. But we feel confident in that given the current market environment. And part of that is we have some visibility, as we\u2019ve described on fees, a good bit of visibility on NII. And to be honest, while there are some wage and inflationary pressures because the P&L is lighter, we\u2019ve proactively adjusted the incentive line to compensate for that. And we\u2019re committed to navigating through this environment in a thoughtful way and deliver results that are as positive and as appropriate as possible. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s really helpful color. And just 1 follow-up on the -- some of the expense commentary Eric, you offered. One of the questions we\u2019ve been fielding from a lot of folks pertains to the longer-term expense growth algorithm. You guys have done a really good job of reining in expenses on an absolute basis over the past few years. Clearly, the inflationary pressures are starting to build as we think about your efficiency agenda that you guys have prosecuted on, but at the same time, the inflationary pressure is building simultaneously. How do you see that expense growth algorithm evolving over time? Eric Aboaf : Yes. And I think we\u2019ll know more over the course of the year, but I think there are some inflationary pressures, some of which we can look for ways to at least limit, but we can\u2019t really avoid. So let me give you an example. On the $8 billion expense base that we have, about $2.5 billion of that is salaries. Now salaries historically have moved up about 2 percentage points a year, maybe 3 but right now, if you look at merit increases, the higher salary replacement rates for new hires versus exits, bidding back selectively talent, salary costs are up closer to 4% to 6% on a run rate basis on a base of $2.5 billion. So you could do the math there and start to get a sense that, that creates an additional headwind that we didn\u2019t have and that headwind could be worth an extra point of expenses on the total $8 billion base. It\u2019s that kind of environment that we\u2019re operating in. I mean we need to see if that persists into next year. Do we have a recession or not, what happens to labor markets. And then the other part of that is working through where we are on non-comp expenses, where vendors come to us sometimes and say, look, we feel the need to adjust, and we\u2019re obviously trying to manage and rein that in. And I think that\u2019s another factor. So I think we see some of those. We\u2019re trying to telegraph them, but we\u2019re also committing to -- committed to achieve and deliver on our medium-term targets. And some of that\u2019s going to be by finding in some ways to maybe limit or contain or offset. But in other ways, they may come through. The interest rate environment will give us a tailwind. And then you heard us describe some of the selective changes that we\u2019re discussing with clients around pricing and top line pricing. So there are a number of different factors. I think I\u2019m not -- it\u2019s early to give a fulsome view of what next year portends. But I would say that we\u2019re conscious, we\u2019re in a elements that we can control and others that aren\u2019t as controllable. But we\u2019re also committed to getting to our medium-term targets. And I think that provides a good set of goals for us and that we\u2019re committed to. Ron O\u2019Hanley : Yes, Steve, what I would add to that is that throughout this period that we\u2019ve been managing expenses over the last several years as we\u2019ve been quite clear on, we\u2019ve also been investing in the business, particularly around automation and technology. There\u2019s still payoffs expected from that. We\u2019ve seen some. There\u2019s more in the future. So the other bit of this we\u2019ll be continuing to manage that algorithm between how much we continue to spend on automating more to get the future productivity savings. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Ron. Hi, Eric. Guys -- maybe Eric, you\u2019ve, in the past, given us an update on the variable rate pricing of your fee revenues. What percentage of fee revenues today would you consider variable pricing, which are greatly influenced by market levels, of course? And second, and Ron, when you talked about -- talking about price increases for some of the products for your customers, is that for both the variable rate type pricing as well as fixed rate pricing? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Let me -- Gerard, let me start. Our pricing schedules, there\u2019s a lot of history behind them on the servicing fee side. I would say that -- and we disclosed this in our Q with some specificity, but about half of the revenues earned through the servicing fee schedules are market level dependent. So the kind of assets under custody levels. There\u2019s then a portion that is driven by transactional or activity of volumes and then the balance is fixed. So there is a mix. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing flowing through the P&L at this point. They are complex schedules. They -- you can measure them with a ruler in some cases, just because they span the world. They expand products and regions and entities and often have some history associated with them. But that\u2019s a broad basis. Ron O\u2019Hanley : Yes. And then, Gerard, just the second part of your question, are we going at the asset-based fee, the variable fee or the fixed fee? I mean, it\u2019s a little bit of both. And again, we\u2019re trying to be reasonable firstly, to our clients, but also to ourselves and really tying this to where there\u2019s real inflationary pressures. And also recognizing that we have a commitment to generating really good service for our clients, right? Service better than our competitors. So it\u2019s less about is that the variable or the fixed, it\u2019s where are we having these pressures and therefore, where do we need a price increase. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just as a quick follow-up, Eric, in the held-to-maturity portfolio, the duration was 2.8 years, as you pointed out. Can you share with us the OCI accretion back into capital? About how many basis points a year do you think you\u2019ll see in that? And then second, what\u2019s the average yield of that HTM portfolio today? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Let me do that in pieces. Then the HTM portfolio, I think there\u2019s good data for you and others in the financial addendum. And you can find that on Page 9 of our agendum. The -- we described the AFS portfolio both on average and on an end-of-period basis in the HTM portfolio. And I think in total, the yield on AFS right now is about 91 basis points, on the held-to-maturity about 155 basis points. And that\u2019s just because of the duration that we tend to put in held-to-maturity to protect it from OCI. In terms of the accretion that will come through, we expect the accretion to start towards the fourth quarter, in particular, a little bit in the third and then into the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re looking at accretion in the $100 million to $200 million range of capital. It will bounce around quarter-by-quarter as different maturities come through. But that\u2019s a healthy amount of capital accretion, and that could be worth 10, 15 basis points of capital and could certainly help us fund the future buybacks and other returns of capital to shareholders, which, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019d like to restart in the fourth quarter and continue on from there. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : First, thanks for changing the time of your conference call, given so much else happening today. So on the pricing due to inflation, I mean, it all makes sense. It\u2019s all logical. But can you actually get that done? We\u2019ve talked for the last 3 decades. Now it seems like you have more of a reason to increase pricing than ever before. Ron, you\u2019ve been on the other side of this, you\u2019re getting the phone call. \u201cHi, this is State Street. We\u2019d like to increase the pricing by 5%.\u201d And then you\u2019re like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to go to these other 3 or 4 or 5 providers.\u201d So how much confidence do you have that you can pass on some of these price increases to your customers? Ron O\u2019Hanley : It\u2019s a good question, Mike. I would say that what\u2019s changed over the years is virtually everybody. You go back 15, 20 years ago, virtually everybody bought the same service. It was custody fund accounting. It was publicly listed markets. It was fairly consistent in playing and it was very easy to do, as you said. I think what\u2019s changed is that even -- certainly, in the medium to large managers, you\u2019re seeing a broad product base, some of which are actually reasonably complicated to do, whether it\u2019s complicated because of the skills required complicated because of the technology that\u2019s required. And it\u2019s in those areas where we\u2019re seeing the highest inflationary pressures. And we think that we offer a superior capability. We think that in many cases, there\u2019s just limited capacity in the marketplace. And we also think that it\u2019s a time where -- that everybody is seeing the same kind of pressure the last 10, 15, 20 years, the world\u2019s been enjoying, in effect, the great deflation. And that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on now. So it\u2019s always dangerous to utter those words. This time is different, so I won\u2019t. But we do think there\u2019s a set of circumstances in a targeted set of areas where pricing adjustments are required. And that we believe that clients will understand. And again, very early reads, but they seem to be. Michael Mayo : And as a compromise, are you talking more about compensating deposit balances, like the trust banks had in the past when rates were higher? Ron O\u2019Hanley : No. Michael Mayo : Okay. Just why don\u2019t -- we want to get paid more because our costs are up for us and everybody else. And so 1/3... Eric Aboaf : Mike, that\u2019s on deposits, remember, we\u2019ve been under-earning on deposits against what cost us to hold deposits, which is preferred securities, right, for -- now several years, we barely offset that at the height of the last interest rate increase in 2017 and \u201818. And so -- we\u2019re just trying to get to par on deposit spreads. And obviously, as deposit rates rise, we give a reasonable proportion of that back to our clients. So we do that purposely. That\u2019s part of the social contract. But that feels like it\u2019s going back to a normalized level, the wage and salary and non-comp pressures that we\u2019re seeing are not different than what others are seeing in the rest of the economy. And that on a net basis is quite different. Michael Mayo : Okay. That\u2019s good clarification. Thank you. And then just last on that, your cost is going higher. I thought a lot of banks seem to have an advantage just like you. You had $2 billion of expenses, $1 billion in comp, but comp -- and society is going up less than other inflation, right, like food, rent, gas, everything else is going up a lot more than employee costs. And what we\u2019ve been hearing, at least anecdotally, among the banks is that some of those employee cost pressures have been waning in the most recent months and weeks. But what I hear from you is that that\u2019s not the case? Or even if it is the case, you\u2019re still talking about kind of 2x historical growth than in the past? Ron O\u2019Hanley : Mike, what I would say is what you say about comp costs lagging behind other inflationary expenses, I mean, that is true, and that\u2019s typical, right? That\u2019s typically how kind of inflation works its way into and through labor markets. I would say that we\u2019ve certainly seen a much higher than trend pressure on us and I would venture since we\u2019re swimming in the same pool of skills here. I would say certainly with our nearing competitors in -- particularly in the skilled areas that we need. And as Eric noted, in some of the -- when we\u2019re replacing somebody that\u2019s come in at a much or a significantly higher cost than before. Now I think it\u2019s also true that if you believe that there\u2019s a recession facing us or that in any event, there will be less kind of economic growth going forward than what we see now for a period of time. That\u2019s likely to take pressure off it, but there\u2019s still a very real move up in select areas around our expenses. And I actually don\u2019t think it would be different for a comparable institution. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research. Robert Wildhack : Ron, just a quick 1 for me. I wanted to ask about the drop in RWAs in the quarter. Could you talk about what the drivers are there? And what kind of RWA outlook or assumption is embedded in your guidance going forward? Eric Aboaf : Yes. We -- as you recall, Rob, we had, in the first quarter, consciously deployed more RWA in some of our business activities, in particular in trading and in lending, just because we were -- we had a surplus amount of capital and so we put it to work and had some good revenues. This quarter, we\u2019re writing that back in, partly because we were driving -- we were committed to driving our capital ratios upward. And partly, to be honest, we\u2019ve found some opportunities for optimization. So I talked about more of a -- more than a $10 billion reduction quarter-on-quarter. That came across businesses and securities finance that came in the lending book where some of the loans qualified for margin loan treatment, which comes at a different RWA level. And then we had some amount of credit, I\u2019ll call it, sort of credit-light in the investment portfolio that was 100% risk weighted that we allowed to roll off. So there were some tactical adjustments that we made in that -- on that basis. We also tend to have some volatility in RWA. The FX derivatives book can move around by $3 billion, $4 billion, and that was -- that we got a good balance there. So I think about 1/3, I\u2019d say, was of the $10 billion to $12 billion quarter-on-quarter reduction was a good balance, and we\u2019ll take those. But that could actually that $3 billion to $4 billion could bounce back up in the third quarter, and we\u2019re obviously considering that we continue to accrete through the P&L every quarter. And I think we\u2019re quite comfortable with our capital ratio trajectory into the third quarter and also in such a way that we can prepare for buybacks in the fourth quarter as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Firstly, I want to echo Mike\u2019s comments that about changing the timing of the call, I am glad. I would take that 1 step further and say in the future it will be helpful if you even think of another day, so it will be not on such a crazy day for all of us, so we can actually pay a little more attention to it. But moving past that, the price increases that you\u2019re talking about on the servicing contracts, given that these are longer-duration contracts, Ron, when should we expect that they could start to go through? Is it a year out? Or do you think you could actually go -- these could go into effect in a fairly short order? What kind of timing would you point to? Ron O\u2019Hanley : Yes. That it\u2019s a good question. And again, because we\u2019re trying to be very fact-based and tie it to where there\u2019s increases and where we feel we need to do this. The answer is it varies. In some cases, it\u2019s around particular transactions or asset class types where we can institute in other cases. There is an agreement that we need to secure from the client but our goal is to -- I mean, obviously, the pressure is now. So we want to put it in as soon as possible. Again, we\u2019re early in this process. So we\u2019ll see what we accomplished in terms of overall timing. But I think given our approach, which, again, is based on facts and the realities of client situations, we\u2019re optimistic that we can accomplish something here. Operator : There are no further questions from the phone lines. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference back over to Mr. Ron O\u2019Hanley for closing remarks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you all for participating in the call, and thank you for your support. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Ilene Fiszel Bieler : Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O\u2019Hanley, will speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2022 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then requeue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation, also available in the IR section of our Web site. In addition, today\u2019s presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the risk factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. 2022 continues to unfold like no other year in recent memory with the challenges faced today arising partly out of, but acutely different from, those the world faced in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the global operating environment continues to be very challenging, our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the resilience of our business model and our focus on maintaining and further improving State Street's pre-tax margin, which was a solid 29% in the third quarter, excluding notable items.  During the third quarter, financial markets were negatively impacted by the adverse effects of the ongoing war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds, including continued price and wage inflation, dramatically higher interest rates, significant U.S. dollar strength, and heightened fears of a global recession. These factors collectively drove heightened uncertainty which contributed to meaningful declines in both global equity and fixed income markets, as well as increased market volatility, which in turn impacted flows.  We continue to carefully navigate the business for this environment. While the operating climate created a number of fee revenue headwinds for our business in third quarter, the savings and efficiency of our Alpha and enterprise outsourcing offering makes our value proposition even more attractive to asset managers and asset owners in the current market and inflationary environment. We maintained a solid balance sheet and strong capital position, delivered significant NII growth as well as healthy FX trading revenues, and remained laser focused on intensely managing what we can control as demonstrated by our expense management.  Turning to Slide 3 of our presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Starting with our financial performance, third quarter '22 EPS was $1.80 or $1.82, excluding notable items, compared to $1.96 or $2.00, excluding notable items in 3Q '21. Double-digit year-over-year declines in average global equity market values drove most of this decrease. Total fee revenue for the third quarter declined 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the impact of significantly lower global equity and fixed income market levels on servicing and management fees as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. Within total fee revenue, our global markets franchise once again continued to perform well, with FX trading services and securities finance revenues increasing 14% and 4% year-over-year, respectively, as the business was able to benefit from increased volatility while supporting our clients.  We also drove a solid result within front office software and data, with third quarter revenue increasing 9% year-over-year. Total revenue for the third quarter declined just 1% year-over-year, as lower total fee revenue was largely offset by a very strong NII result which increased 36% relative to the year ago period, driven primarily by higher interest rates. Faced with continued market-related fee revenue headwinds and inflationary pressures, we remain focused on controlling expense growth. Even as we invested in our people and business, third quarter total expenses were flat both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and expense management.  Business momentum was solid in the third quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to 233 billion. Encouragingly, our third quarter wins include expanded relationships with two existing Alpha clients, demonstrating our ability to broaden and deepen client relationships and drive new back office mandates through our Alpha strategy. As a result of this quarter's solid sales performance, AUC/A 1 but yet to be installed was 3.4 trillion at quarter-end. Front office and data also experienced good business momentum in the third quarter, with annual recurring revenue increasing 20% year-over-year to 267 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management totaled 3.3 trillion. Overall, third quarter AUM flows and management fees were negatively impacted by weaker equity and fixed income markets, but we still saw positive net flows into our cash, SPY and U.S. low cost ETF products during the quarter. Even in a volatile environment, our global institutional money market business has continued to gain market share this year, with AUM reaching a record level of third quarter having experienced four quarters in a row of inflows. We remain excited by our Global Advisors strategy and the growth potential of franchise, and announced new leadership in the third quarter as Yie-Hsin Hung will become our SSGA's new President and CEO in December.  I would now like to turn to the proposed acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman's Investor Services business, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. The current regulatory environment for M&A transactions involving G-SIBs is challenging. We are engaged in ongoing dialogue with U.S. and international banking regulators regarding the prolonged regulatory review process. We have developed with BBH proposed modifications to the transaction, including changes to the operating model and legal entity structure and a reduction to the purchase price.  We anticipate that a modified transaction would be somewhat more complex and include a delay in timing and amount of deal synergies, resulting in a slower path to accretion. While discussions with regulators on the proposed modified transaction are ongoing, the likelihood of a successful outcome is increasingly uncertain. There can be no assurance that a mutually acceptable modified transaction will be agreed and entered into, or as to the timing or outcome of any regulatory approvals and other closing conditions for a modified transaction. The modifications to the transaction remain subject to review and approval by both BBH's partners and our Board of Directors.  As previously noted, the sale and purchase agreement allows each of State Street and BBH the right to terminate the transaction upon written notice without a contractual penalty at any time. We continue to believe the strategic rationale for the transaction remains compelling and that has encouraged us to continue to seek an acceptable path forward. These efforts are actively underway. And as we previously stated, we expect to reach a decision on whether the transaction can proceed forward during this quarter. Turning to our balance sheet and capital. Despite a continued rise in interest rates, our CET1 capital ratio was a strong 13.2% at quarter-end. As I have noted previously, we recognize the importance of capital returned to our shareholders and it remains an integral component of our medium-term targets. Accordingly, having already announced a 10% per share increase to our quarterly common stock dividend earlier this year, we now intend to repurchase approximately 1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter under the existing common stock repurchase program authorization, which expires at the end of 2022.  Additionally, and keeping with our medium-term targets, it is also our intention to return greater than 80% of earnings in 2023 in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to approval by our Board of Directors and market conditions at the time. If the proposed acquisition of BBH Investor Services does not progress, we would expect capital return to be significantly more than that amount. To conclude, the events of the last two and a half years have demonstrated the resiliencies of State Street's business model during times of heightened market volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. Even as financial markets broadly declined in the third quarter, we delivered a healthy pre-tax margin of 29%, excluding notable items, in addition to solid new business wins. While the environment is challenging and uncertain, we remain confident in our ability to continue to successfully execute against our strategic agenda, and improve our operating model and financial performance over the medium term for the benefit of our clients and shareholders. As we look ahead, we will continue to adapt to the highly uncertain environment by remaining intensely focused on managing what we can control as our solid expense discipline in 2022 to date has demonstrated with year-to-date total expenses flat to the same nine-month period in 2021 even as we invested meaningfully in our people and business. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric to take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.80 or $1.82, excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, as detailed in the panel on the right of the slide. As you know, the operating environment in the third quarter remained challenging with persistent market volatility related to ongoing geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, rapidly rising interest rates and concerns about the global economy. Despite these challenges, as you can see on the left panel of this slide, strong growth in both net interest income and our FX trading services business enabled us to partially offset the significant headwinds from lower equity and fixed income markets in the quarter. Additionally, we continue to demonstrate prudent expense management in the third quarter even as we experienced ongoing price and wage increases, while we continue to invest in the franchise. Turning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw a period end investment services AUC/A decreased by 18% on a year-on-year basis and 7% sequentially. The year-on-year change was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. The quarter-on-quarter decline was largely a result of these same factors. Similarly, at Global Advisors, period end AUM decreased 15% year-on-year and 6% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by positive net flows in both our ETF and cash businesses.  Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third quarter total servicing fees down 12% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average equity and fixed income market levels, lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 9% year-on-year. Even with the negative impact of the market environment in the quarter, I would highlight that we're pleased to see good double digit growth in our private markets businesses. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 6% primarily as a result of these same drivers.  Lastly, we recorded traditional custody wins worth 233 billion in the quarter with attractive fee rates across key client segments. And we now have more than 3.2 trillion of assets to be installed, a good portion of which are attributed to large Alpha deals that were won over the past year. Given our large backlog, we installed approximately 250 billion of assets this quarter, which is in line with our historical pace.  Turning to Slide 7. Third quarter management fees were 472 million, down 10% year-on-year primarily reflecting lower average equity and fixed income market levels, a previously disclosed client-specific pricing adjustment, institutional net outflows and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of the impact of money market fee waivers and positive net ETF and cash inflows.  Management fees were down 4% quarter-on-quarter, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds and the impact of currency translation. Notwithstanding the challenging backdrop in the quarter, while we did see some outflows in our ETF business due to an exit of a low yielding Asia Pacific fund, our franchise still remains well positioned for growth. In ETFs, we saw sustained ETF inflows into the SPDR low-cost suite and fixed income funds. In our institutional business, there's continued momentum in defined contribution with third quarter inflows of 10 billion, including the target date franchise. In our cash business, top quartile performance on our government money market fund was a major driver of net inflows which contributed to market share gains in the institutional money market funds.  On Slide 8, FX trading services had yet another strong quarter. Relative to the period a year ago, third quarter FX trading services revenue was up 14% primarily driven by higher FX spreads driven by higher market volatility and the recent regulatory capital changes, partially offset by lower client FX volumes. Quarter-on-quarter FX trading services revenue was down 4% as the benefit of higher FX spreads was more than offset by lower client FX volumes which tend to be lower in the summer months.  Securities finance performed well in the third quarter with revenues up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher spreads due to higher specials activity, only partially offset by lower agency and enhanced custody balances due to falling market levels. Sequentially, revenues were up 3%, mainly reflecting higher agency spreads.  Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher front office software revenues associated with CRD, which were up 9% while lending fees were down 11% due to changes in product mix. Finally, other fee revenues of negative 5 million in the third quarter declined on a year-on-year basis, largely due to negative market-related adjustments. Sequentially, we saw an increase in other fee revenues, primarily reflecting fewer negative market-related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 9, let me provide some details on the performance of the front office software and data revenue in the third quarter on the left panel of the slide. Front office software revenues increased 9% year-on-year as our more durable and recurring software enabled revenue continues to grow nicely, driven by new client implementations and continued success in converting clients to a cloud-based SaaS platform environment. Sequentially, revenues were up 1% due to higher software enabled revenue partially offset by lower professional services revenue. Our revenue backlog remains healthy. Turning to some of the CRD and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we continue to be pleased with our new bookings for the business. The 14 million of new bookings from this quarter was well diversified across client segments, particularly wealth and asset owners, demonstrating the benefit and breadth of clients the platform can now support. As for middle office, we continue to have extremely healthy uninstalled revenue backlog of over 100 million which is up 50% on a year-on-year basis, as I mentioned earlier.  Now turning on Slide 10. Third quarter NII increased 36% year-on-year and 13% sequentially, primarily reflecting the impact of higher short-term interest rates from central bank hikes only partially offset by lower client deposits. More than 40% of this increase was driven by non-U.S. dollar rates, as we saw central banks globally raise interest rates.  On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the third quarter. As a result of a rapidly changing rate environment, industry-wide deposits have begun to trend lower and we are seeing some of this play through our balance sheet as well. Excluding the impact of currency translation, average deposits were down 5% both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily driven by the global tightening in monetary policy by central banks and by the impact of significantly lower market levels on AUC/A. The investment portfolio is down modestly as we continue to manage duration and we now have more than 60% in HTM. As today's results reaffirm, our balance sheet continues to be well positioned to recognize this interest rate and NII tailwind and also protect AOCI.  Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter expenses, excluding notable items, were once again proactively managed in light of the revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation and notable items. We've been carefully executing on our continuing productivity and optimization savings efforts, which generated approximately 80 million in year-on-year gross savings or approximately 230 million year-to-date, which puts us in line to achieve our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4% of the expense base. It also contributed to our year-to-date positive operating leverage, which we also expect to deliver for the full year. These savings in addition to benefits from a stronger U.S. dollar enabled us to offset some of the wage inflation we have been seeing in the industry, while we continue to invest in the strategic parts of our company, including Alpha, private markets and operations automation.  On a line-by-line basis compared to third quarter '21, compensation and employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation was partially offset by higher salary costs associated with wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 6%, primarily in our Poland and India global centers as we invested in foreign technology capabilities and added operations town [ph] to support new products and services in growth areas such as Alpha, private markets and in middle office servicing. There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch up post COVID. We expect headcount growth to start to level off.  Information systems and communications expenses were down 2%, as we began to see benefits from our in-sourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was down 10%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs related to equity market movements. Occupancy was down 5%, largely due to currency translation. And other expenses were up 17%, primarily reflecting higher securities processing costs, marketing costs, travel costs and foundation grants. Moving to Slide 12. On the right side of the slide, we show our capital highlights. We're pleased to report CET1 of 13.2%, up 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by higher retained earnings and well controlled RWA. With respect to RWAs, there is volatility and I would caveat that they were lower than we expected this quarter. We would anticipate some RWA increases that we continue to both optimize the balance sheet and efficiently put capital to work across our businesses.  Third quarter Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.4% was up 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the decrease in balance sheet size and higher retained earnings. As the slide highlights, our capital position is strong and our commitment to being stewards of shareholder capital remains steadfast. In keeping with that commitment, we returned 232 million to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends.  And as Ron highlighted, we now intend to repurchase approximately 1 billion of State Street's common stock in the fourth quarter. This higher than expected buyback amount is based on our healthy capital levels and our expected future uses of capital. The AFS, mark-to-market and OCI this quarter amounted to $170 million negative as compared to minus 0.5 billion in 2Q '22, meaningfully improved as a result of the management actions we took despite another strong run up in interest rates this quarter.  Turning to Slide 13, we provide a summary of our third quarter results. Despite the continued volatile market environment, I'm pleased with our quarterly performance. Even with the current macroeconomic environment and persistent geopolitical uncertainties, our strong growth in net interest income and FX trading services enabled us to partially offset another quarter of significant headwinds from both equity and fixed income markets, highlighting the resiliency of the franchise, and our expenses remained well controlled, demonstrating our laser focus on productivity. Turning to our outlook, let me share our current thinking regarding our fourth quarter and some of our macro assumptions as we look over the remainder of the year. At a macro level, while market rate expectations have been volatile, our current interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggests a year end Fed funds rate of 4.5%. We expect other international central banks to continue to raise rates in 4Q and beyond into 2023 as well.  Our outlook assumes 4Q equity market levels will be flat to the September month end, which would imply a 10% quarter-on-quarter decline in global daily average equity markets in 4Q. We also expect continued U.S. dollar strength to be worth about 1 percentage point of headwind and a tailwind to expenses on a quarter-on-quarter basis, which is included in our guide. So, in terms of the fourth quarter of 2022. Given the expected decline in average global equity market levels, we expect total fee revenue to be down about 3% on a sequential quarter basis, with servicing fees down 4% to 5% quarter-on-quarter and management fees down 8% quarter-on-quarter.  Turning to NII. Following yet another strong sequential increase in NII in 3Q, we expect to deliver additional NII growth of 4% to 10% quarter-on-quarter driven by the tailwind from U.S. and foreign central bank rate hikes. This outlook includes our expectation for some continued deposit outflow in 4Q. For the full year, we now expect NII to increase 28% to 30%, which is better than our prior full year guide of 24% to 27%. We also expect continued good growth in NII in full year 2023.  Next, we expect total expenses, excluding notable items, to be roughly flat quarter-on-quarter despite inflationary wage pressure, as we continue to target productivity initiatives in the face of a challenging environment for fee revenue. This focus should enable us to drive positive total operating leverage and a healthy pre-tax margin for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Full year expenses are expected to be flat versus last year. Finally, we would expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% for the quarter.  And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there. So maybe just a wrap up question on BBH, and I appreciate all the transparency along the way, but regulators hate it, more complex, market values have fallen. I definitely went with you on the strategic merits. But I guess the question people have is why not just walk away? It seems like you could do some really creative stuff with the capital now. And at what point do you just say, not worth it, not as good creative, too complex, enough said? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Glenn, it's Ron. Maybe needless to say, we go through that calculus that you're describing every day. And that's part of what led to this. Obviously, the regulatory environment is driving the timeframe here. But what's driving our work is that tradeoff, the tradeoff between the opportunity to consolidate on a global basis a very attractive firm versus what's the alternative uses of the capital, including returning it back to shareholders. We believe there's still the possibility that we can get this -- we can structure this transaction in a way that it will work out for shareholders and to achieve that strategic objective. But as we've said in the disclosure, the likelihood of that happening is going down. So I think what you can take away from this is one of the reasons that's driving that decreased probability is the calculus that you're describing. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Well, I guess we don't have to wait that much longer. So I can chill out for another couple of months. Just one follow-up on, I think you mentioned 60% of the securities portfolio has been moved into held to maturity. It shows in the smaller AOCI hits as rates go up. What's the other side of it? Like can you calculate what the NII give up or any other offsets to moving that larger piece into held to maturity? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it\u2019s Eric. We\u2019ve carefully considered what portion of the investment portfolio move to held to maturity and in what amounts. But we do as we make that consideration is the benefit is that you largely don't give up NII, right? By and large, you're earning the coupon on whether they're treasuries or agencies or MBS, just in a different accounting form and structure, but the earnings of the corporation are the same and that's what's quite attractive about HTM. The reason why you wouldn't put the whole portfolio in HTM is partly you want some flexibility, you want from time to time rebalance the portfolio, and you might want to rebalance 5, 10, 15 yards and that takes an AFS construct under which to do it. And then partly you want to make sure that you always have monetization at the front end to maximize and to maintain the liquidity contract you'd like. We've now put that in place. We can repo HTM securities in size. We test that in the marketplace. So we're quite comfortable. But there's a point where you say, look, I'd rather sit on cash or I'd rather sit on available for sale until we feel like we're at a good balance now that really provides a real positive NII trajectory and you see that. We've got it now to 28% to 30% up in NII this year. And I've also started to signal that we're positive on the NII trajectory in 2023, and partly because the entire investment portfolio, whether it's an AFS or HTM is contributing to that upswing. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : And next we'll go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to come back to putting the deal into context with the buyback that you announced, which you would have been clearly saying you'd want to get back into the buyback this quarter. So can you just help us understand the $1 billion sizing and if that has anything to put in context with your thoughts around how the pricing and eventual outcome if the deal goes through might end up coming through? Or is it completely separate and just based on where capital sits regardless of the deal outcome? Eric Aboaf : Ken, it's Eric. As I said in my prepared remarks, the buyback was larger than anticipated. And part of that is we do two things. We look at our current capital levels, which have trended towards that 13% CET1 mark that we had guided to. Remember that discussion we had in the first quarter. And then because - partly as we consider the capital uses over the next couple of quarters, including the possibility of the Brown Brothers Investment Services transaction. And you would expect us to factor in any downward adjustments or purchase price that we would expect, and that's effectively what we've done. So it's a mix of factors, but those are the components. And I think we're quite pleased. We can now proceed with $1 billion. As Ron said, we're planning on comfortably returning more than 80% of earnings to shareholders next year quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter, which is what our medium-term targets are, and that's still availed us the capacity to do a deal at an admittedly adjusted price if it's appropriate at the time. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then on the denominator side, I guess of capital, can you just give us a little color on how you'd expect deposits to traject from here, pretty meaningful decline in both interest bearing and non-interest bearing just relative to where you're ending here, just your general outlook on your thoughts around deposit mix and flows? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think our deposit trends will probably be in line with some of what you're seeing in the industry. I think we're within that zone of -- if you look at the Fed reports, if you look at other institutions, and we've certainly begun to see that rotation out of deposits this quarter, down about 5%, both year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter, adjusted for currency translation. I think what we have seen over the last year is a series of factors that have impacted it, and this is my way to say that I can give you some guidance, but it's going to vary depending on how the factors play out. So you have U.S. dollar appreciation. So you have a -- non-dollar deposits are come down as a result. We have equity markets falling, which means the AUC/As that we custody for are coming down and with that investors, institutions, retail hold similarly lower cash amounts. And so part of what's happening here at the environment is actually affecting deposits somewhat independently of where we are with rising rates and quantitative tightening. Now we are seeing the effects of rising rates and quantitative tightening as well, so I kind of give you that as a background because I think there are four or five factors at play here which is more than expected. I think as we look forward, we continue to expect some deposit outflows in the fourth quarter. We expect those to be somewhat less than we saw in the third quarter. But we do expect some, and those are factored into our NII guide. And one of the reasons why we have a wider NII guide than usual is because there's a range of outcomes. But we're seeing what we expected. We're seeing what we expected as rates rise and we price carefully and maintain, I think, some healthy betas this quarter. We're seeing non-interest bearing begin to flow out with higher rates, both in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., in particular, you have the difference that clients can earn. And then one of the things we're doing with our clients is to think about the full range of offerings for them. Sometimes it's the base account, sometimes it's special accounts with deposits. If you remember, we've historically put in place deposit initiatives to have the right balance of deposits on the balance sheet. And then the other thing that this is feeding is some of our other businesses, whether it's the cash business in GA, whether it's the repo business, there's a whole set of product offerings that cash flows to that we're pleased to support our clients with. So there's quite a bit going on in this area, more to come. But we're comfortable with some of these forecasts. And what I find particularly important to keep in mind is NII continues to rise, even with some of these deposit outflows. And part of that is the U.S. rate that we're also familiar with, but given that so much of our balance sheet is international, those foreign rate rises are particularly helpful. And those deposits are I think good levels as well. Ken Usdin : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Blostein : Hi, Ron and Eric. Good morning, guys. I was hoping we could speak a little bit more broadly around State Street's capital allocation strategy. If BBH does not go through, what's your appetite for any other deals, whether it's in the services space or asset management space? Obviously, macro conditions are pretty volatile. So I'm sure that'll impact that as well. But curious how you thinking about the tradeoff between the accelerating buyback or other deals? And then if you do go down the path of more buybacks, should we be thinking about the upper end of your CET1 and leverage as sort of the target to which you will go to, or you might need to run with a buffer sort of on top of that, given uncertain macro conditions? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Alex, why don't I begin on this just on how we think about M&A? It's not like we have a shopping list here. BBH is a unique opportunity to consolidate the market on a global basis. And by that I mean it's not just about adding to some particular geography, but it really does bolster us in all the major geographies that we're in. Having said that, we've got our own what we believe is a distinctive, organic strategy in the servicing area, led by our Alpha proposition, which continues to grow. There's a lot of development that was being completed this year and early next year, which will lead to a lot of new onboardings and we think even make the proposition attractive to a broader set of clients. So we always are looking in the marketplace to see if there's something that makes sense, but it's not like the money's burning a hole in our pocket. And if this doesn't work, we're immediately going to go out and come back with something else. Eric, you may want to talk to just how we think about the context of buybacks? Eric Aboaf : Yes. And Alex, I think I'd add that we're quite conscious that we raised almost $2 billion of equity from our investors and diluted them. We certainly expect that if the deal doesn't proceed that the bulk of our excess capital needs to go back to shareholders. That's deserved and I think expected and we would deliver on that. I think in terms of capital ratios, I had said earlier this year when the economic environment felt more benign and when we had simplified and attenuated a lot of the OCI risk in the investment portfolio that we might be willing to go down to the lower end and even below the lower end of our 10% to 11% range. I think now given the economic uncertainties, we for the time being expect to operate towards the middle of that range. That they might change over time. But for now, I think our current expectation is, we have reduced the volatility in the investment portfolio, which reduces, on one hand, the need for a capital buffer to some extent, on the other hand, the economic environment is much more -- there\u2019s much more volatility in it. And that pushes us in the other direction. But the net of that is that I think we're quite comfortable with the 10% to 11% range and operating somewhere in the middle there. Alex Blostein : Great, thank you. That's helpful. My follow-up question maybe around the business side of things, you guys have a very sizable pipeline of installations. And on the servicing side, a lot of them are Alpha mandates, which obviously tend to be a little bit more complex. You talked to us I think on the last call sort of the cadence of how that's going to come through on the revenue side. But I'm just kind of curious how you would contextualize any incremental investments or expenses that will need to come with it, given sort of complexity of those installations over the next 12 to 18 months? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, I'll start Alex on the investments and Eric can talk you through the pattern. On the investments, there is actually ongoing development, as I mentioned earlier, and that development, some of which is being completed this year, some which has been completed next year, but it's all part of our medium-term plan as well as our budget. So there's nothing out of the ordinary that you should expect to do this. And in fact, much of the development is behind us or will be behind us at year end. Within the 3.4 trillion, as you would expect, it's the larger, more complex Alpha mandates, in some cases, their development partners with us where we're developing new features and functionality, which will be available not just to that particular client, but more broadly to the client base. So these are important things to get done right, and we think are a good use of our investment dollars, because they'll result not just in being able to onboard that client, but to be able to broaden the offering. Eric Aboaf : And then, Alex, I'd add that we certainly need to plan and begin to set up onboarding teams. Those are well underway. And so you saw headcount tick up this quarter. For example, expenses though were well controlled. The headcount was in our hubs and some of the lower cost markets purposely. So we're navigating through that. But some of the expenses have to be put on in advance of as we're doing the onboarding and advance of the installation and the recognition of revenue, and some come as the revenue comes on. But I think, as Ron said, all this is within our expense guidance. It'll be within our expense guidance when we get to that in January for next year. And our view is that we collectively need to continue to drive margins in the right direction, given our medium-term targets. That needs to be a mix of both the revenue lift we're getting from Alpha deals as well as the expense and productivity initiatives, both within the Alpha environment and across the traditional franchise, and all that has to come together to deliver on our financial commitments. Alex Blostein : Great. Thank you both. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, Ron and Eric. Thanks for taking the questions. I'd like to ask on BBH. It seems somewhat unusual to be getting regulatory approval before the approvals within the company. So why is that happening? And given that there's risk of deterioration, loss of talent, customers, Ron you made reference to this during the last quarter call when you guys first said you were renegotiating. Would you have the ability to adjust price further if this process drags, or has that been set already? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, on the approvals, our Board has been actively involved in this brand as has the BBH partners on their side throughout this process. So obviously, there was an approval before we announced this in September of '21. There's an ongoing consultation with our Board. And we've walked through modifications, but we don't have a final deal yet largely because we have not actually gotten through the regulatory process and figured out what the actual structure would be that will satisfy all of the regulators. So it's not completely binary and that we're not talking to our Board until it's all done. But obviously, our Board needs to see the entire thing in total and be able to make that decision. In terms of the ongoing kind of risk to clients and people, that's there. It continues. We're spending a lot of time with clients. I think I've mentioned before, about half the client base is a shared client base, so the clients that we talk to anyway. I think there's still a strong desire on the part of our clients that if this can be completed in a way that makes sense, they'd like to see it completed. So I do not worry about further client attrition. We obviously are worried about people attrition on both sides, but largely on the BBH side. And we're monitoring that closely. And to the extent to which we felt like after the price reduction we've already negotiated that circumstances have changed sufficiently further that we needed that again. Of course, we would raise that if we needed to do that. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for that, Ron. And then second question is maybe a bit -- well, I'll just come right out. So why is this so strategically compelling? It seemed as though it was largely a scaled deal. Now it's deteriorated. You said earlier Ron that the accretion is probably going to be more drawn out and it's going to be lower than initially planned. It's more complicated. So you're introducing a lot of operational and legal complexity. I get it, you're lowering the price. But is this really a good use of time? Is this really a good use of management focus? Why not just understand that the environment deteriorated, the regulatory approvals didn't come through, it couldn't work as constructed. And so it's better off just to walk. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Again, I'm probably repeating myself a little bit, Brennan, here but that's exactly what we ask ourselves every day. And you're right. It is taking a lot of management time. I think what's compelling about it is several things. One is its footprint. Many of the things that are out there or supposedly out there or rumored to be out there tend to be single geography kinds of things. And if you have a strong desire to be in that geography, maybe there's something useful there. I would describe at best tactical. This one adds scale to us everywhere where we are and really does set it apart from the other. Secondly, it's got some technology assets that we like. We've talked about those in the past. Third, it's got a set of people and professionals that we believe are equal to and sometimes even better than some of our people. And that's attractive to us. But that has to be weighed against all the factors that you and others have raised here and continue to do that, which is why we're not coming here saying to you, yep, we're ready to go. We're not ready to go. It\u2019s also why we're coming here saying to you that we recognize this has gone on long enough and that we need to bring this to a close this quarter. Brennan Hawken : Amen to that. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Next, we'll go to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So why don't I ask one clarifying question on NII. Some of your bank peers they've indicated 4Q exit rate could be close to the peak this cycle just as lag deposit pricing begins to catch up with rate hikes. You noted that the '23 NII Eric will be up nicely year-on-year. But do you see the potential for '23 NII coming in above that annualized 4Q level, suggesting that that fourth quarter NII guidance is not going to be representative of the peak? Eric Aboaf : I think you're trying to get deeply into our 2023 forecasts and I think it's a little premature to do that to be honest. Let's see how deposits flow and evolve this coming quarter. Let's see whether the U.S. central bank and the foreign central banks continue to have the wherewithal to tame inflation because that's important, right, or are they going to -- or not. So it's quite dependent upon all that. I think the reason I made my positive statements about 2023 is that we don't see fourth quarter as the quarterly peak. We think there's more NII upside over subsequent quarters. We also have a balance sheet that has a mix of USD and non-USD and in some cases, we tend to have more foreign deposits. And those are areas if those foreign central banks continue to hike and address the serious inflationary environments in their geographies that give us an additional tailwind that may be different than a U.S. Bank. So there's certainly momentum here. I don't want to get into fourth quarter annualized versus my current view of 2023. But I did say good continuing growth purposely. I think there's more to come on NII. But I think we'll no more than a quarter or two to be honest. But we see a trajectory that is good and reasonably positive, given what we know in the environment today. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that, Eric. So reading the tea leaves, I may scrap my question on the expense growth algorithm and what that implies for next year. But the one area I did want to unpack on expense is the margins in the investment management segment, they're down about 600 basis points year-on-year. That's an area where you made significant progress over the last couple of years. Certainly, you're going to see some pressures given the declining market. But why you get a sense as to how much expense flexibility you have there and where you think you can actually hold the line on the pre-tax margin for that particular business? Eric Aboaf : I think I'd start answering that question by saying we're actually quite pleased by the progress we've made in growth and margins in the investment management business over, call it, the last three years. I think it had teens level margins, if you go back in time, we got into the 20s. Some of that was the market uptick, which flowed through the management fee line. Some of it was I think delivering strongly on flows and net new revenues was positive across the franchise. Cash as an example continues to be a standout. But each of the three franchises have new products and offerings have been quite good. And I think what the team has done there well is as they have secured those flows, launched those new products, they've also managed the expense base. And so just because it was a tailwind from equity markets or fixed income markets or from flows, they've actually kept expenses remarkably flat in that environment or flattish in that environment, which I think is a testament to how they've navigated the environment. I think what you should expect is that a couple of things. If equity markets continue to operate at this level, we need to continue to work on expenses and productivity becomes an even bigger focus there as it should be across the company. I think on the flipside of that if we get some kind of rebound in equity and fixed income markets that plays through the asset management business financials, I would expect expenses to continue to be disciplined there and margins to certainly go back to some of the higher levels that you saw. But I would say I think at 31% margins, we're quite pleased with where we are and I think there is -- depending on where equity markets go, I think the trajectory will continue in a generally positive direction. Steven Chubak : Helpful color, Eric. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Next, we'll go to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just one quick clean up on BBH. Can you close that deal if it all works well? Can you close that on December 31 or earlier and buyback the 1 billion? And do you need to have that Tier 1 leverage ratio be within or above your target range? In other words, can you do this and be at say the low end of the target range just temporarily for 4Q or even below? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. I think the timing of this feels quite uncertain given where we are. We've not been able to complete the regulatory process and there's still -- so I think thinking about this in months as opposed to quarters is premature. We've done the buyback calculation though fully considering the reduced price that would be part of a Brown Brothers transaction. And so whether the timing is quarter X or quarter Y, we're comfortable proceeding with $1 billion. We're pleased to get it started in the coming days. And regardless how that plays out, be able to return as I said and as Ron said comfortably more than the 80% that we've committed to throughout next year at a minimum. Brian Bedell : That's great. And then just one on the deposit betas. Maybe if you can just talk about or how you see them right now as they exist in terms of like how you're defining them for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S.? And then as we move into next year, maybe sort of an outlook without giving NII guidance, of course, but just sort of a range of where you think the terminal betas could be in the U.S. versus the non-U.S., even if it's a fairly wide range? Eric Aboaf : Yes, let me describe it this way and let me cover U.S. and non-US because both matter in a positive way for our books. I think the betas this quarter in the U.S. were in the 55% range. We're pleased to see that. Those are up from about 35% last quarter, but exactly where you'd expect us to be where we expect it to be given the uptick in rates. And next quarter if we go from 55% this quarter to 65% betas next quarter would be quite comfortable, and then it just continues to inch up. That's just how it plays through. In euros, we're also in that 50% range as we've started to cross into positive territory for central banks, and we expect that to continue. So part of the reason for the NII forecast into fourth quarter and into next year is that we expect betas in this 50% to 60% range in euros. The market operates a little differently than the U.S., but that would be in the range. And then in pound sterling, betas are lower. They tend to be in the 30% to 35% range there. And then you can keep going; Aussie dollars, Canadian dollars and so forth. And we have a balance sheet that is prepared for rate rises across those currencies as well. And then you'll just see betas notch up quarter-over-quarter. I think at the terminal level, there's always some amount of lagging that you do, that's just how it happens. You never get to 100% beta or anything near that, because you have some non-interest bearing and you have some lag deposits, but we'll see. We're comfortable where we are in the 50% range going to 60% and I think it will play out well for the NII and the balance sheet accordingly. Brian Bedell : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s great color. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Next, we'll go to Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Eric, maybe just one last question on NII and I apologize, but as we think about big picture, Fed funds being potentially 20 basis points or more higher than 2018, European rates being positive versus negative back then, do you see anything conceptually to suggest your NIM shouldn't be higher than back then or just want to get your thoughts on that? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it\u2019s Eric. I'm a little more focused on NII than on NIM. And the reason we've done that is because we've actually changed the shape of our balance sheet over time. Remember we added some deposit initiatives which tend to be at lower NIMs, but they are NII accretive and positive. And we do that because sometimes we want to balance currencies around the balance sheet, we want to raise deposits where we want to land. We need to keep deposits for intraday. There lots of reasons why we have different mix of balancing, and we've done that purposely and in an engaging way with our clients over the last two, three years. So I don't think -- as a result, the balance sheet is bigger. And part of the reason we've allowed it to be bigger is that the leverage ratio is not particularly constraining on us. And so what our intentionality is, is actually to maximize NII as opposed to NIM. So I think as you play that out, I think our NIMs are lower at this point than they were last time in the cycle, and I think they'll likely be below the -- the NIMs will be below the highs of the last cycle. On the other hand, I think if you calculate the forecast we've given you for NII for fourth quarter, so the next quarter that we're about to print, that will be a new high of NII relative to what we had seen in the last cycle. And that's where we're a little more focused, because that's what comes back to shareholders and what creates earnings and earnings momentum that contributes to the bottom line. Jim Mitchell : Okay, fair enough. And just maybe on the BlackRock ETF transition, how much is left and do you see that as a material -- any kind of a material impact on forward revenues? Eric Aboaf : Our guidance has been pretty consistent on this. And I think you'll find it in our 10-Qs and Ks that we estimate that the revenue outflow is about 2 percentage points of fees. So that hasn't changed. You saw some of that begin to come out this quarter that was worth about 5 million this quarter. If you kind of get to the full quarter amount, it'll be just under 10 million for fourth quarter. And that was worth about $1 trillion of AUC/A. So that did occur, and we'll continue to keep you updated on that. But as we previously disclosed and talked about, deconversions just take time and it will play out sometime towards the second half of 2023 and then into 2024 will probably be the majority of it, but we'll just see. We're working closely with BlackRock. We continue to be quite pleased with all the existing business we do with them and the work we do for them in the alternative servicing area, which we're one of the largest providers and certainly help them as they want to evolve, diversify and support their other plants. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon, Eric and Ron. Eric, can you remind us, you talked a little bit about it in your prepared remarks about fee revenues and the pricing pressure that you see every year. Can you remind us if that number has changed a bit at all? And second, as part of that, I think you've also indicated in the past, you needed a certain amount of assets under custody to neutralize that pressure. I don't remember, I think it was 1.5 trillion, but I could be wrong of new business wins to neutralize that downward pricing pressure? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, let me start that and it is an area that we continue to work on. The pricing headwinds are just a condition of our industry. Why? Because as you remember, pricing is AUM or AUC/A based. And so as equity markets go up, clients expect some of that to come back to them. The pricing headwinds on an aggregate basis in the servicing fee line are about 2 percentage points of headwinds a year. And when we saw that bubble in 2017, '18, '19, that's come back down. That ticked up and then it's been well managed back down to that 2% or so level. And that's what we are seeing today. We're not seeing anything different than that. And it's well within our expectations. In terms of wins, we always want to focus on net new business and for net new business to drive a positive impact on the revenues as they did this quarter. I was clear in my prepared remarks that that net new business was positive. We had some nice wins. We actually had some nice wins and nice fee rates, right, because both matter to your point. The benchmark I've put out there is that we expect about 1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year to be in a good positive direction and trajectory for net new business. But to be honest, as the CFO, I always like to see a little more and you've seen last year was particularly strong. This year, year-to-date, I think we're already comfortably at that level, and we still have another quarter to go. So the sales momentum continues. And what I find important is it continues to close both our traditional customer accounting business and our Alpha offerings, and so it's been broad based. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Gerard, what I would add is on the topic of pricing, we mentioned to you at the end of the second quarter that we launched a targeted repricing initiative that is well underway. And it's focused on the areas of high value or where costs are increasing higher than in other places. And that is intended to and is to achieve margin preservation. In other words, to offset the cost of delivering something high value or to offset the increasing costs in areas, for example, where we have disproportionate market data and things like that. So that initiative is well underway. When we talked to you last time, it had just launched. So we were in the dozens of clients. Now we're in conversations with triple digit number. So we're pleased with that progress too. Gerard Cassidy : And has it been well received or understood, I should say, nobody likes price increases, but the clients understanding of why this conversation has to take place? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, I think understood is the right word, Gerard. I think that these are sophisticated institutions themselves. They see what's going on. So I think it's been for the most part understood. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, Eric, as a follow up, can you remind us what percentage of assets under custody or under management are variable rate priced products, meaning your customers paying basis points on the assets under custody? And so therefore, to your point, when the value goes up and down, obviously, it affects revenues. Eric Aboaf : Yes, it's a bit of a mix across different segments and across geographies, but a good rule of thumb is 50%, 55% are assets under custody base, so move up and down with market. There's another 20% of the pricing tends to be based on transactional activity and we actually saw transactions, volumes, DTCC trades, wire transfers, derivatives, transactions, so forth come down this quarter. And then the last 20%, 25% tend to be relatively fixed or sometimes semi fixed, the number of funds you custody for or some flat fees. Gerard Cassidy : Gentlemen, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Okay. Next, we'll go to Mike Brown with KBW. Your line is now open. Michael Brown : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess on BBH, I suppose it's been a while since we've gotten a financial update on the business and how it's performed in this volatile environment year-to-date. And clearly there's a possibility that we have a resolution that could not end up moving forward with the acquisition. So as we think about our models here and getting those kind of aligned with how BBH is performing, anything you can share on how the company has performed year-to-date? Eric Aboaf : Yes, we\u2019re obviously monitoring the business performance closely; monthly, quarterly. And I think it's -- you should expect -- you can go back to some of the materials that we had shared a year ago, September, as the base case, but you could take that Mike and extrapolate some of what you've seen in our book of business, right. We're an asset management oriented custodian. You can even look at some of our peers as benchmark. And I think you'd find what we've seen, which is that there's a sharp boost in NII in their book or NII plus fees, because of the mix of programs that they run for their clients cash, partially offset I'd say with some downdraft in servicing fee rates, equity and bond markets. And then you'd see a bit of an uptick on the FX services kind of business. So I think it's ours and other large custodians are parallel to what you've seen. And so it's something worth considering. But as we talked about earlier, we're conscious that we need to think about this from a couple different perspectives, but it's performing in line with what we and you would expect at this point. Michael Brown : Okay, understood. Thanks for that color, Eric. Maybe just one last cleanup one for me. How should we think about how the unrealized losses on the AFS portfolio could creep back over the next call it 12 to 24 months as we think about your capital ratio, or how that will impact the capital ratios over that time period? Eric Aboaf : Yes, it is part of our capital forecasting now. And it was actually included in some of the buyback and capital return estimates that we provided not only for the fourth quarter, but also for our intentions related to next year. I think this quarter the accretion was worth $60 million or so of capital and that's just the reversal of that mark accreting back as the bonds mature. There tends to be a little lumpiness to it, but that's the start of the accretion. And so it did provide some amount of modest tailwind and we'll certainly factor that in, right, because just like earnings create an opportunity to return capital to shareholders, the accretion does as well. And that'll be part of that builder capital ratios, which then we can share back with shareholders. Michael Brown : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Next, we'll go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Michael Mayo : Hi. Just to clarify, so in the next 10 weeks, we should either expect you to say that you'll proceed with the BBH deal or that you won't be proceeding and maybe they'll be an extra $2 billion buyback. Am I interpreting that correctly? Ron O\u2019Hanley: What you should take away from what we've said, Mike, is that by the end of this quarter, we will have a decision on whether to proceed forward or not to proceed forward. On the buyback, first, we need a Board authorization for a further buyback and we'll communicate what we're intending on buybacks after that authorization. Michael Mayo : Okay. And just I know that the first question of this call was why not just walk away and that's been the topic. Let me just take the flipside. I'm sure you've invested a lot of resources and time and thought into this. Is the real issue just the regulators? And I'm just wondering, it's like roughly what, like 10% of your size? Are other G-SIBs either 10x to 15x larger? When I worked at the Fed 30 years ago, it'd almost be considered de minimis, right? And I'm just trying to figure out the change. We all know the change of mindset as it relates to mergers generally. But I'm just wondering, does this put you at a permanent strategic penalty box that you can't pursue any mergers? Or is it something unique to this deal? Now I know you can't talk particulars about this deal in general. But can you make any broader statements like when [indiscernible] to that, it gets extra scrutiny or it's not as easy to get through anymore? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Mike, what I would say is that the timing of our announcement in this deal in retrospect probably couldn't have come at a worse time, because if you think about the regulatory agencies, many of them to some extent were going through some kind of personnel change. So that itself has slowed things down. In some cases, it's driven a very significant change in philosophy. Whether that change in philosophy will be permitted or not, I don't know. I'd like to think not. But to answer I think the nub of your question is did anything change from beyond the regulatory situation? The answer is no. For all the reasons that we've stated to going back to September of last year, we feel like the deal is strategically compelling. In terms of longer term, what does this mean for our position? Again, that's something that we think about and that's something that we certainly have conversations about with our primary regulator. And I think there's some sympathy to all that. But I don't want to talk about something in the abstract beyond the transaction that we're in, which is the BBH deal. It's not all regulators, it's a subset. And it\u2019s a situation that we're going to work our way through, but work our way through very cognizant of what it means for our shareholders, what it means for clients, et cetera. Michael Mayo : And then last follow up on this, is there anything that you can do to help control the outcome of this at this time? Or is it simply based on the analysis by the regulators? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, we've talked about modifications to the transaction and the modifications are meant to meet either regulatory concern or to navigate -- or to do what we believe is required to navigate through regulatory concern. So that's what we're up to now. Michael Mayo : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Just a couple of quick follow ups. One, I know you've had some M&A charges, merger integration charges over the past few quarters. If any of that is for the BBH deal? Was there anything in a walk away that you would be refunded for? I'm guessing the answer is no, but I just want to make sure I understand how that works. Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. No, those are incurred charges that are about primarily our staffing and then some of the service providers. But we've also -- what we have done is avoided some of the -- obviously there are costs that are continued on deal closing, some of the advisory fees, et cetera, those have not played through there and those would not be incurred. So those are kind of the base level expenses. Betsy Graseck : And then -- Eric Aboaf : There's no tail on those by and large. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. And is it possible to size how much of those were for or have been for BBH or --? Eric Aboaf : Since earlier this year, they primarily have been around the BBH transaction work. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then we've had two quarters of very strong dollar performance here, dollar strengthening Q-on-Q. I see it in the deck the ins and outs on the drag on revenues, the benefit to expenses, a little bit of a drag on the AUC/A, AUM volumes. You've got some benefit from volatility and the trading one. So just wanted to get your sense of how has the dollar strengthening all-in impacted you and how do you think about managing? That was just generally speaking. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Betsy, it\u2019s Eric. What I'd describe to you is that the dollar has an effect as do all of the currencies on our P&L and balance sheet. But it's relatively symmetric and thus I'll say almost neutral. And I say that in EBIT terms and in balance sheet terms. Dollar strengthening reduces revenues, but also reduces expenses, not in all currencies and all the time, but it tends to have almost an EBIT neutral impact on the P&L. And then on the balance sheet, you also have a similar effect where as deposits are revalued downwards and foreign jurisdictions as U.S. appreciates, so are the assets in those jurisdictions. And so you have some symmetry. So by and large, it's I'll call it roughly neutral, which is why we don't do any particular hedging on it, because we find that we can manage through it in a comfortable manner. Except that it makes our reporting to all of you in the investment community a little more complicated, but that's just what needs to happen. Betsy Graseck : And when you think about the footprint that you have today and the effort to continue to get scale in that footprint, is the international exposure strategically important from a diversification perspective or do you feel that the growth outlook for the non-U.S. markets is higher, just wondering? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Betsy, it\u2019s Ron. Let me take that. I would say that we've got a good geographic mix now. And so the way we think about it in virtually all of our locations, it's not like we're not at minimum efficient scale. But to the extent to which we can achieve more scale there, we'd like that. I think in general, the non-U.S. markets have continued in most circumstances, not all to grow faster than U.S. markets on balance. If we could get a little bit more there, we'd like that. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next, we'll go to Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Sorry to beat a dead horse, but going back to BBH, given that you talk about buying back $1 billion of stock, the deal value was 3.5 billion, that's a pretty substantial percentage. Would you still be buying the full entity you had intended to when you announced the deal, or is there some elimination of a part of it? And flip it the other way, could you buy just a piece of it or is it only available as a whole thing? Eric Aboaf : Vivek, it\u2019s Eric. Kind of the outlines, the perimeter of the deal with Brown Brothers hasn't really changed. It's around their investment services business. That's the business that we're attracted to. And that's the one that they'd like to transact. So there's not been any real change there. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. And Vivek, we were never buying the whole business. Vivek Juneja : What I meant was the whole investment services business. Could you buy a piece of it since it's different geographies, given the regulatory complexity to sort of, if they're geographies are more attractive and more difficult to replicate on your own? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes, I suppose that's something we could explore, Vivek. Then the attraction goes down even more so. And not clear that that accomplishes what Brown Brothers itself is trying to accomplish, which is they'd like to exit the business not have even a smaller bit than they already have now. Vivek Juneja : Ron, I want to go back to a different topic. You mentioned about the price increase discussions you're having and you said the operative word is understood with your clients. Should I interpret understood as understood and agreeing to it or understood but not necessarily open to it and shopping it around with other providers? Ron O\u2019Hanley: So I would say, again, this has been highly targeted, Vivek, so it's not like we've said, there's an X% across the board kind of thing. We've really tied it to one where our costs are under the most pressure. And two, where there's a high value added delivered to the client. And so I think you should interpret understood as -- we understand why you're asking for this. There's certainly some talk around it and is that the right number, et cetera. But I would say in more cases than not, in fact far more cases than not, we're getting agreement on it. Vivek Juneja : Great. Thank you. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Ron O\u2019Hanley for any additional or closing remarks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, thank you, operator and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Thank you Ilene and good morning everyone. 2022 was an unpredictable year for many of the world\u2019s investors and the people they serve. Despite a market rebound in the fourth quarter, 2022 was the worst year for financial markets since the global financial crisis. Both fixed income and equity markets impacted by the war in Ukraine and several macroeconomic headwinds including bulk of supply chains, price and wage inflations, dramatically higher global interest rates, U.S. dollar strength, and heightened fears of global economic recession which remain today. The uncertainty created by these factors contributed to a meaningful year-over-year decline in global financial markets as well as increased market volatility impacting flows. Despite these difficult macro conditions, State Street performed well. As a result, we continued to progress in 2022 towards achieving our medium term targets. Our durable 4Q and full year 2022 results were driven by a strategy underpinned by our relentless focus on innovation, the power of our distinct value proposition, and State Street\u2019s diversified products and services, all of which continue to resonate with clients as demonstrated by yet another year of strong, organic net new servicing wins.  As we continue to execute against our strategic agenda, we achieved a great deal in 2022. Slide 3 of our investor presentation shows our full year highlights and the progress we made towards achieving our strategic goals in 2022. In a challenging operating environment and compared to what was a very strong year for our business in 2021, we again delivered positive total operating leverage, pretax margin expansion, and a higher return on equity as you can see on the left of the slide. We drove continued business momentum, including 1.9 trillion of total new asset servicing wins, delivered total revenue growth, and demonstrated ongoing expense discipline in the face of inflationary pressures and our continued investment in the resiliency and capabilities of our businesses, as you can see on the right and bottom of the slide. While weaker average market levels created fee revenue headwinds for our investment servicing and asset management businesses in 2022, our balance sheet businesses combined with higher interest rates and our deposit strategy produced materially higher net interest income as compared to 2021. In addition, our foreign exchange trading services and front office software and data businesses produced double-digit year-over-year fee growth, manifesting the desired results of our investments in these businesses and demonstrating the revenue diversification of our business model. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation, I will review our fourth quarter highlights. Business momentum was solid in the fourth quarter with new AUC/A asset servicing wins amounting to 434 billion driven by broad based wins across client segments. We reported two new alpha mandates in the quarter and expanded 12 existing alpha relationships, seven of which added additional back and middle office offerings. Helped by this sales performance our AUC/A installation backlog was 3.6 trillion at quarter end. At Global Advisors quarter end assets under management totaled 3.5 trillion, supported by another good quarter of ETF inflows. Turning to our fourth quarter financial performance, 4Q 2022 EPS was 1.91 or 2.07 excluding notable items, up 7% year-over-year or 4% higher year-over-year excluding notable items. The year-over-year EPS growth in a challenging market environment was supported by the resumption of common share repurchases in the fourth quarter as we focused on returning capital to our shareholders. Even in a year marked by economic and political disruptions, total revenue for the fourth quarter was the highest on record, increasing 3% year-over-year as lower total fee revenue was offset by very strong NII result which increased 63% relative to the year ago, primarily driven by higher global interest rates plus our balance sheet positioning and effective execution of our deposit management strategy. As we meaningfully invested in our people and business, we remain focused on expense discipline in the fourth quarter with total expenses down 3% year-over-year or flat year-over-year, excluding notable items, in part supported by the stronger U.S. dollar. This was achieved by our relentless and ongoing focus on operational productivity, simplification and automation. Turning to our balance sheet and capital, our CET1 capital ratio increased to a strong 13.6% at year end. Recognizing the importance of capital return to our shareholders and having already announced a 10% per share increase to our common stock dividend earlier in 2022, we resumed share repurchases in the fourth quarter, buying back a total of 1.5 billion of State Street's common stock. For 2023, it is our intention to return up to 200% of earnings in the form of common stock dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions and other factors. We expect our business mix, balance sheet strategy, and earnings momentum will enable us to do so while maintaining prudent capital ratios within our target range. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock purchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023. To conclude my opening remarks, I am pleased to be reporting the third year in a row of pretax margin expansion and higher return on equity, which demonstrates the successful progress we have made towards achieving our financial goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail before I discuss our strategic priorities for 2023. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron and good morning everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on Slide 5. First, we recognize acquisition and restructuring costs, including wind down expenses related to the Brown Brothers Investor Services acquisition transaction, which we are no longer pursuing. Second, we recognize 70 million of repositioning costs consisting of an employee severance charge of 50 million to eliminate approximately 200 middle and senior manager positions, largely related to our investment services business as we continue to streamline our organizational structure. We also recognized 20 million of occupancy charge in the quarter to help us further shrink our occupancy costs. We expect these actions to generate a total run rate savings of roughly $100 million. Lastly, we recognize the benefit of 23 million in the quarter related to the settlement proceeds from a 2018 FX benchmark litigation resolution, which is reflected in the FX trading services GAAP revenue line. Taken together, we recognize notable items of $78 million pretax, or $0.16 a share. Now, turning to Slide 6, I'll begin my review of both our fourth quarter 2022 and full year 2022 results. As you can see on the top left of the table, despite the dynamic and challenging operating environment, the diversity and durability of our business model allowed us to finish the fourth quarter with solid results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 3% year-over-year or 5% year-over-year, excluding notable items, as lower fee revenue was more than offset by robust NII growth of 63%, which I'll spend more time discussing later in today's presentation. We also continued to demonstrate prudent expense management, which enabled us to deliver positive operating leverage in the quarter and pretax margin is up more than four percentage points year-on-year, while ROE is up more than a percentage point this quarter as well. On the right side of the slide, we show our full year 2022 performance. Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment, we saw in 2022 for the year, I am quite pleased that we again delivered positive operating leverage and nearly a percentage point improvement in pretax margin. As Ron mentioned, it has been three consecutive years of margin expansion and ROE improvement.  Turning to Slide 7, during the quarter we saw period end AUC/A decrease by 16% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 3% sequentially. Year-on-year the decrease in AUC/A was largely driven by continued lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, a previously disclosed client transition, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business installations. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased as a result of higher quarter end equity market levels and the positive impact of currency translation. At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Period end AUM decreased 16% year-on-year and increased 7% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels, some institutional net outflows, and the negative impact of currency translation, which was partially offset by 22 billion of net inflows in our SPDR ETF business. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily due to higher quarter end market levels, ETF net inflows, and the positive impact of currency translation, partially offset by cash net outflows.  Turning to Slide 8, on the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees down 13% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, lower client activity adjustments and flows, normal pricing headwinds, and the negative impact of currency translation, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of the currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 1%, primarily as a result of the client activity adjustments and flows.  On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators which highlights the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. As you can see, AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter totaled a solid 434 billion driven by strong broad based traditional wins across client segments and regions, including expanding relationships with existing alpha clients. At quarter-end AUC/A won but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion, with alpha representing a healthy portion, which again reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy. Turning to Slide 9, fourth quarter management fees were 457 million down 14% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and the negative impact of currency translation, which represented about two percentage point headwind. Quarter-on-quarter management fees were down 3%, largely due to equity and fixed income market headwinds. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop in the year, our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs we saw solid full year net inflows in the U.S. with continued momentum and market share gains in the SPDR low cost equity and fixed income segments. In our institutional business, there's a continued momentum and defined contribution with 48 billion of inflows in the full year, including target date franchise net inflows of 21 billion, offset by industry wide outflows in Institutional Index products. In our cash franchise, we still gained 60 basis points of market share in money market funds in 2022, even though first half inflows reversed in fourth quarter.  On Slide 10, you see the strength of our diverse revenue growth engines with both FX trading services and software and processing up double-digit teens year-on-year in a difficult year. Relative to the period a year ago, fourth quarter FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 15%, primarily reflecting higher FX spreads partially offset by lower FX volumes. Our global FX franchise was able to effectively monetize the less liquid market environment which was driven by sharp moves in the U.S. dollar. Sequentially FX trading services revenue ex-notables was up 8%, mainly due to higher direct and indirect revenue. Securities finance performance in the fourth quarter was more muted with revenues up 1% year-on-year. Sequentially revenues were down 6%, mainly reflecting downward pressure on spreads due to lower special activity and year-end risk of activity by clients.  Fourth quarter software and processing fees were up 16% year-on-year and 17% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenues associated with CRD, which were up 28% year-on-year and 25% sequentially. Lending fees for the quarter were down 10% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix and flat quarter-on-quarter. Finally, other fee revenue of 18 million in the fourth quarter was flattish year-on-year and up 23 million quarter-on-quarter, largely due to the absence of negative market related adjustments.  Moving to Slide 11, on the left panel you'll see fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 28% year-on-year, primarily driven by multiple on-premise renewals and continued growth in software enabled revenue associated with new client implementations and client conversions to our cloud based SaaS platform environment.  Turning to some of the front office and Alpha business metrics on the right panel, the 21 million of new bookings in the quarter was once again well diversified across client segments, including asset owners, wealth and private markets as well as across asset classes, particularly in fixed income. Front office revenue, backlog and pipeline remains healthy, giving us confidence in the future growth of this business. As for Alpha, we are pleased to report to two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter in the insurance and asset owner of client segments.  Now turning to Slide 12, fourth quarter NII increased 63% year-on-year and 20% sequentially to 791 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short and long term market interest rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. We have a well-constructed balance sheet including both U.S. and foreign client deposits, a scale of sponsored repo franchise, and high quality loan and investment portfolio that was consciously configured to benefit from rising global rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by higher global market rates working through our balance sheet. On the right of this slide, we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and increased 3% sequentially, primarily due to deposit levels as well as currency translation impacts. The U.S. client\u2019s deposit beta, excluding some new deposit initiatives was about 65% to 70% during the fourth quarter. Foreign deposit betas for the quarter were much lower in the 20% to 50% range depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Total average deposits were up sequentially. We saw sequential quarter reduction in non-interest bearing deposits of 5% which was more than offset by higher NII accretive interest bearing deposits that will help support high quality client loan growth and selective expansion of the investment portfolio. Turning the Slide 13, fourth quarter expenses excluding notable items were once again proactively managed in light of a tough fee revenue environment and flat year-on-year or up approximately 3% adjusted for currency translation. We have been carefully executing on our continued productivity and optimization savings efforts which generated approximately 90 million in year-on-year growth savings for the quarter or approximately 320 million for 2022, achieving near the top end of our full year expense optimization guidance of 3% to 4%. These savings enabled us to drive positive operating leverage and pretax margin expansion, which while partially offsetting continued wage inflation headwinds and continued investments in strategic parts of the company, including alpha, private markets, technology, and operations automation. On a line by line basis compared to 4Q 2021 compensation employee benefits were down 1% as the impact of currency translation and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher salary increases associated with nearly 6% wage inflation and higher headcount. Headcount increased 9%, primarily in our global hubs as we added operations personnel to support growth areas such as alpha and private markets, invested in technology talent, and in sourced certain functions. There was also a portion of the headcount increase associated with some hiring catch up post COVID. We expect headcount to increase more modestly in 2023. Information systems and communications expenses were down 5% due to benefits from our insourcing efforts and continued vendor pricing optimization, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was up 1%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees and market data costs, partially offset by lower sub custody costs related to lower equity market levels. Occupancy was down 17% largely due to an episodic lease back real estate transaction associated with the sale of our data centers which was worth approximately 12 million. And other expenses were up 12%, primarily reflecting higher professional fees and travel costs. Moving to Slide 14, on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels relative to our requirements. At quarter end, standardized CET1 ratio of 13.6% increased 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by episodically lower RWA, partially offset by the resumption of share repurchases in the quarter. With respect to RWA's, it's worth noting that we saw unusually low RWA this quarter worth about $10 billion, largely driven by our markets, businesses and some specific currency factors. We would anticipate a similar amount of normalization of RWA in the 10th $15 billion range going into first quarter. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6% at quarter end, was down 40 basis points quarter-on-quarter, mainly due to the resumption of share repurchases in fourth quarter.  We were quite pleased to return $1.7 billion to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of a 1.5 billion of common share repurchases and 220 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has authorized a new common stock repurchase program of up to 4.5 billion through the end of 2023. And as I said in December, we expect to execute this buyback at pace and get back to our target ranges for both CET1 and Tier 1 leverage market conditions and other factors dependent. Turning the Slide 15, let me cover our full year 2023 outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have significant potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect some point to point growth in global equity markets in 2023, which equates to global equity markets being down about 2 percentage points year-on-year on a full year average basis. Our rate outlook for 2023 largely aligned with the forward curve, which I would note is moving continuously. However, we currently expect to reach peak rates of 5% per Fed funds, 3.25 at the ECB, and 4.5 at the Bank of England.  As for currency translation, we expect the U.S. dollar to be modestly stronger than the major currencies on average, but less than what we saw last year. As such, currency translations like to have 0.5 point or less impact on both revenues and expenses. In light of the macro factors I just laid out, we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be flat to up 1% ex-notable items with servicing fees likely flattish and management fees down a bit, largely due to a modest reclassification of revenue, other fees, and NII. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, we currently expect fee revenue to be down 1% to 2% ex-notable items on a sequential quarter basis, given some normalization of foreign exchange market volatility that impacts our trading business with servicing fees expected to be up 1% to 2% and management fees expect to be down 1% to 2%. We expect full year 2023 NII to be up about 20% on a year-over-year basis after a very strong 2022. This is dependent of course on the outcome of rate hikes and deposit mix and levels. After a significant step up in fourth quarter 2022 NII, we expect first quarter 2023 to be flattish. And after the first quarter of 2023, we expect to see a slide 1% to 2% of sequentially quarterly attenuation of NII throughout the remainder of 2023, then with the stabilization expected in 2024. Turning to expenses, as you can see in the walk, we expect expenses ex-notables will be up 3.5% to 4% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven partially by wage and inflationary pressures and continued investment in the business and our people, while still driving positive operating leverage. You can also see on the walk that for a full year 2023, we expect growth saves of approximately 3%, which will help offset inflationary pressures and variable costs and ongoing investments in areas like private markets and alpha and further automation. Regarding the first quarter of 2023, on a year-over-year basis, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up about 2%. Finally, taxes should be in the 19% to 20% range for 2023. This outlook would deliver a fourth consecutive year of margin expansion and advances us towards our medium term target goal of 30%, as well as deliver positive operating leverage and strong EPS growth for our shareholders. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Thanks, Eric. As we enter 2023, we see an uncertain environment. On the positive side, many supply chains have been repaired, the outlook for energy supply is better than anticipated, particularly in Europe, and developed world inflation may have peaked. We proceed continued rising interest rates in the short term, but at a slower pace. The most significant known risks are geopolitical, including the Russia Ukraine War, China from an economic performance and policy perspective, and the United States as it approaches its debt ceiling. Turning to Slide 17, even with another year of economic and geopolitical uncertainty ahead of us, we continue to be very clear in our strategic priorities for 2023 focusing on what we can control. We plan to deliver further growth, drive innovation, and continue to enhance shareholder value as we further progress State Street towards its medium term targets. First, we are targeting further improvements in our business growth and profitability by leveraging State Street\u2019s alpha value proposition and enhancing its private markets capabilities. As we aim to become the leading investment service or platform and enterprise outsource solutions provider in the industry, we intend to maintain and extend our leadership positions in a number of key businesses. In global markets, we aim to expand wallet share as a leading provider of liquidity, financing, and research solutions to investment professionals. At Global Advisors, we aim to build on our strengths in areas such as ETFs and cash, while organically accelerating growth efforts in fast growing segments where we can win. Second, as we have over the past several years, we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization as we build out a simplified, scalable, configurable end-to-end operating model. As we lead with client service excellence, productivity will become a core differentiator of our value proposition. Third, we must continue to build a higher performing organization. We are strengthening execution skills and increasing accountability, thereby fostering an even more results oriented culture required for future growth. Our fourth priority is supported by and the intended outcome of the first three priorities and is aimed at achieving our financial goals, meaning another year of positive operating leverage, margin expansion, and higher returns. To conclude, supported by our distinctive value proposition and diversified offerings, as well as our ability to manage State Street through challenging environments, I believe that we will be able to execute on each of these strategic priorities in 2023 as we advance towards achieving our financial goals, all while being an essential partner to the world's investors and the people they serve. And with that operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you very much. I like the NII outlook, I want to ask you a question on that. You've been a big beneficiary of higher rates. I'm curious on the deposit side, down almost 10% year-on-year in the quarter, but actually up a drop sequentially. I wanted to think about or could you tell us what you're thinking about that you have stable outlook for 2023 for deposits, we've seen a lot of fear in the banks in deposit runoff and betas and attrition and so curious what gives you that confidence for the flat deposits for the year, thanks? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it's Eric. We've navigated through interest rate cycles before, right, and so we have a fair amount of internal data. And we also have, I think, an engagement with our clients that really understands the multiple avenues for them of putting their cash. Clients broadly with us have $1 trillion of cash, some of that's in deposits, some of that's in our sponsor repo program. Some of that's in our global advisers, money market complex, some of it's in our suite products in our State Street Global Link franchise. And so what we're seeing is that clients are shifting gently their deposits between different categories. But they also need an outlet for that cash. They need an outlook for that cash at a reasonable price, at a reasonable ability to move it and use it as necessary. So with that as a context, I think we continue to see some expected rotation out of noninterest-bearing into interest-bearing, that's been happening, I think, at a reasonable pace and kind of in line more or less with what we've seen before, and we expect that to continue for the next few quarters. At the same time, clients do have cash, especially given the risk-off environment but in general, they all sit on cash as part of their investment planning. And we found that they're engaged with us to leave cash in our balance sheet. They like the flexibility. They like some of the pricing. And obviously, some cash comes in at noninterest-bearing, some at lower rates when it's very transactional, some at rates that are closer to market levels. And so it's an ongoing engagement with them and the visibility we have is reasonably good. It can always change. But deposits as a result, seem to be in the zone now after couple of quarters in the first half of the year of coming down a bit, seem to be flattening out. I won't say that we won't see a little bit of seasonality occasionally in January until February, we see a downtick. And then March folks prepare for tax payments is up and then April is down. So we'll see some of that kind of movement. But on average, we expect deposits to be flattish from -- going forward into next year and through the bulk of the year. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that color. That's good. You mentioned repo, so maybe I'll just have my follow-up question. In the slides, I noticed you created this inventory platform for peer-to-peer repo, I would love a minute to go on what it is for, who is it for, and how you get -- how that -- you will get paid for that? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure. This is part of the, I think, innovation heritage that we have here at State Street across the franchise, but inclusive of the global markets area. We -- our sponsored repo program, which is now $100 billion in size, was started in I'm sorry, in 2005, I think, if I go back to the history books. And there's now a $100 billion franchise, right, as an example. And we do this in FX, we do this in sec lending. Venturi is a repo offering that instead of working through our balance sheet or one of the clearing corporations, which is how we do repo today actually directly connects lenders and borrowers of securities and cash. And so it's just another platform, so to speak, another venue that clients seem to want to engage with. A big part of it early on is working with the asset owners, those who are -- have long booked securities and cash. And what we find is sometimes when they may want to make margin calls for -- or have margin calls, they want to raise cash without selling securities, right. And so a natural question of well, where do I repo, do I repo through a bank structure, or do I repo with someone who's on the other side of that trade, right, who actually wants to lend against securities. And so we find that there are counterparties on the other side of that trade, who would be interested in doing that. And what a Venturi does is it actually connects borrowers and lenders with direct access to one another. So they have both the underlying collateral as the stabilizing force. And then they have the counterparty rating. And with different counterparties, you get slightly different pricing and sometimes that flow-through is actually positive and quite appealing both to the lenders and borrowers. So that's a little bit of it in a nutshell. We like to grow it to some amount during the course of the year, early returns are positive. But it's -- I'll put it in a bucket of innovation and how to connect folks in the capital markets, but connect folks who our core clients and provide additional services for them. Glenn Schorr : Great tutorial, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay, one follow-up question on NII and then a question on expenses. Just a follow-up question on NII Eric, I just wanted to make sure I understood the cadence, the pace that you are suggesting NII should follow. I know you used the word attenuate, but we had a debate over here as to which way attenuate was going to traject, so sorry to ask the ticky-tacky, but appreciate it? Eric Aboaf : That's all right. But we want to be transparent and sometimes language always matters, as you say. Our perspective is we've got a very nice step-off point from fourth quarter NII. We said we'd be roughly flattish into the first quarter. And then we expect it to trend downwards, so attenuate downward, let's say, 1% to 2% for the next few quarters. Just as you see you see a tailwind of interest rates creating a positive but you see that continued rotation out of net interest bearing deposits being a headwind. And the net of that is down NII we think 1% to 2% for a couple of quarters. And then towards the end of the year and into 2024, we see rough stabilization probably because we've kind of burned out on the noninterest-bearing rotation, and then we get to a more stabilized area. But all in, we expect full year NII to be up about 20% year-over-year, and we'll take it from there. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Yes. No, that's helpful. And then on the expense side, I know you mentioned that the benefit of the actions you've taken, am I right, $100 million run rate. I just wanted to understand when that comes into the 2023, is that immediate in 1Q, or is that something that comes in over time, just that would be helpful? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Roughly about half of that comes in, in 2023. The payback on most of these actions is about five quarters so roughly half comes in on a fiscal 2023 basis. And then we'll hit the run rate, I think, within quarters, whatever, sixish or something after these actions, most of these actions are in the next few let's call it the next quarter. The run rate then builds to $100 million. So good payback and the kind of actions we want to keep taking in this kind of environment. Betsy Graseck : Yes. So your point, that was my final follow-up, which was, do you feel this is the extent or if for whatever reason, top line disappoints based on macro not working out or what have you, is there more that you would consider doing going forward? Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Betsy, it's Ron. Maybe I'll take that. I mean, we've obviously got a pattern of investments that we're intending to execute. We've also got an ongoing program in place that we've really had running now since 2019. So we certainly -- if the environment were to change materially, we would think about those investments. We would also think about being more aggressive. I mean, we have more or less in the background, continued to take a lot of gross expense out of the system every year. We see an ongoing ability to do that, but we also want to keep investing in the business. So there is a balance there. But to the extent to which things started to go south in an unanticipated way, I mean we do have levers. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if we -- if you had any kind of just -- well, post-game thoughts -- post the BBH decision and within that, just you acknowledged and put forth this $4.5 billion capital plan. Just how will we think about just your commitment to that now as opposed to whatever thoughts you might have about acquisitions going forward? Thank you. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Ken, I mean, as we've always said, we've got a very clear strategy and M&A is not a strategy. M&A is a way to help execute a strategy, to move it faster, to enable it to get further than was anticipated. But it's not a strategy by itself. We are very comfortable with our organic strategy. BBH was a scale enhancing acquisition that we would have liked to have done, but it doesn't materially change. In fact, it doesn't change at all our strategy. So at this point, where we sit, we have a strategy that we like. We have a strategy that we're executing against. There are some big milestones that we're confident we're going to be delivering on in 2023. And therefore, we are committed to that share buyback. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, great. And then on servicing fees, can you help us understand in your flat to plus one, what's the impact of the BlackRock ETF deconversion, where are we in that process, and how much, if any, has already been recognized of that expected revenue attrition at this point? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Yes, I think maybe just to answer that in the various components. I think you saw the BlackRock transition begin at the end of last year was $10 million in the quarter, sort of call it, a $40 million run rate. That continues to transition out in 2023 and in 2024, there's obviously just a natural schedule that you expect that we've worked closely with them on. And so it'll impact our servicing fees during 2023, during 2024, and into 2025, just when you think about the year-on-year comparison basis. I think if you want to model it out broadly, we've said in our last regulatory filing, we said it was worth about two percentage of fees as of the December 31 pointer we just crossed. It's now about 1.7% of fees. And I'll let you sort of build it from there. But it's included in our forecast. It will continue to be included in our forecast. We think about net new business, right, we've got to sell. We always have a bit of attrition, and we'll -- we want to continue to be net ahead. And as you've seen us in the last couple of years, we've been net positive with net organic growth broadly. And then with BlackRock, specifically, they continue to be a very important client of ours. We have continued and kept a good amount of business that we do with them. We're strong providers for them in alternatives, which is growing quickly. And we've also been awarded new business over the last year. And so that will just -- I think it will just be part of the outlook that I give you as we go forward. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, great, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just to follow-up on Ken's last point around servicing fees. I guess if you take your run rate servicing fees at the end of the year, it still implies a pretty wide gap versus where you guys expect to end for 2023. So maybe just provide a little bit more granularity where the ramp is going to come from. So I know equity market is one thing, and you guys are assuming, I think, 10-ish-percent growth in global equity, so that certainly helps. But off of the kind of $4.8-ish billion run rate that you exited that to get to, I don't know, $5.1 billion, that's a 6% growth that's still wider than we've seen in the past. So I'm just curious whether it's new business or something else that you see on the horizon that will help you bridge that gap? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Alex, if you -- I think I tend to spend a little more time on the full year to full year kind of servicing fees, it sounds like you're modeling the last four quarters and then the next four quarters, which obviously model as well, and we have in our budget. It's really a combination of factors, right. So there is -- on a -- if you start with fourth quarter of 2022 and then work forward, we expect some appreciation in equity markets. We'll see if that plays out, and we'll obviously stay in touch with you all. We think that will be a tailwind. We think client flows and activity, in particular, should not be a headwind like it was in 2022, maybe neutral, maybe a positive just as clients have adapted to this new environment. And so we see the new year -- this new year as a time when they're going to be trading, investing, building positions. So we'll see if that plays out, that will be part of it. Then we have net new business. And so we do have a good pipeline both in the traditional servicing and Alpha area. And I think as part of that, we continue to mine our existing client base because the share of wallet growth can be positive there. And then finally, there's always some amount of normal pricing headwinds, but that's factored in. But you kind of have to go through those four areas. And remember, we're assuming some growth in equity markets on a point-to-point basis but we'll see if that plays out. Alexander Blostein : I got you. Alright, that's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up around the balance sheet strategy. I heard the NII guidance, the deposit commentary all makes sense. When it comes to the tailwinds from sort of repricing the fixed portfolio, the fixed securities portfolio, can you help us frame what the roll-on, roll-off dynamic looks like today? And also whether or not there are some more opportunistic actions you guys might take liqutine [ph] with both RFBK [ph] and Northern over the last month or so. With respect to just maybe reaccelerate some of the lower-yielding securities roll off into something that might be a little more attractive here. Eric Aboaf : Yes. Let me describe it as follows. The investment portfolio has an average duration of a bit over two and half years, so call it average maturity of five years. And so you go through the math, and that means about 20% of it rolls on, rolls off in a typical year. It will move around a bit. I think what we found, and that's invested across the curve, it's invested in various currencies, so there's a mix. So you tend to get as you have rolled-off, rolled-on somewhere between 1%, 1.5% to sometimes 2.5% tailwind for that particular quarter of the amounts that are rolling off and rolling on. And so that's what's actually been one of the factors that's in billing the yields and the yield improvement on the profile and both how it was designed and what we're pleased to see. So that will be a gentle tailwind assuming five-year rates stay more or less where they are and European rates continue to float up. And so we'll just have to -- that will be one of the tailwinds that we see.  In terms of more dramatic action, we obviously always think about what we might do. What we've noticed is that if you have high risk-weighted asset positions in your risk-weighted asset-intensive positions in your portfolio, then what happens, you could take the loss, you reinvest, and it helps accelerate a buyback, right. That's why I think a number of players are doing that. Doing the -- just the -- for vanilla instruments, treasuries, agencies, government-guaranteed securities, there's -- I think the benefits are a little closer to a push. We could take some losses through the P&L. They're already in the equity accounts through AOCI, you put on NII in the future. I think that's just moving around of the financials, and we just don't find that that's a particularly compelling trade to do. We'll always evaluate well. So we see if we have specific positions that might need some adjustment. But we don't see that as particularly compelling. It's not really compelling economically. And the financial benefits you guys can kind of model out either way. And so we -- I think we're pleased with the ability to continue to manage the portfolio in line with our current processes, and they've been numerous. The NII is up significantly this past year and up another 20% next year, and we've got a tailwind and it -- I think it bodes well for where we are and where we're going. Alexander Blostein : I got you. Great, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks, good morning folks. Actually on net interest revenue outlook for 2023, Eric, can you talk a little bit about what you view as sensitivity to say if we had rate cuts in the back half of the year, I don't think that's assumed in your outlook, but just if you can talk about that dynamic and whether you think that would just be offset by reducing the deposit beta? And then also on the foreign deposit beta that you talked about, which is much better than U.S. Do you expect that to continue or do you see incremental foreign deposit betas moving higher from here? Eric Aboaf : Yes, let me do it in reverse order. The U.S. versus foreign currency betas in our experience, this cycle, prior cycles, do tend to run at different levels, partly because the U.S. has the structure of noninterest-bearing versus interest-bearing deposits. So the client deposit betas are in a subset of the total and partly because the international markets just operate a bit differently, how we're paid and how that -- those expectations have been set over, I'll call it, decades for the industry, operate differently. So I think for the -- as we look into the next few quarters, we think the U.S. client deposit betas ex any new money that we bring in on an initiative basis is going to be in that 65% to 70% and the international betas, we think will continue in the 20% to 50% range when you look at Euros, Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollars, Aussie Dollars and some of the other currencies. So we think they're kind of in the -- they're going to be in this zone and that gives us some ability to continue to take advantage of the interest rate increases.  If I then work through the other part of your question, what happens with rate cuts, that's in our expectations, that's in the forward curves, especially for the U.S., that there could be a December cut. There's some probability there could be a cut before that. I think it doesn't dramatically affect because they are late in the year. The rate cuts don't dramatically affect the NII forecast, so we'll kind of take it as it goes. I do think you're -- as you're intimating, there's a bit of this offset, which is if the Fed's cutting rates, and there's probably going to be even more cash that clients keep on hand and deposits in the system, there'll probably be some offsetting impact. And obviously, with the U.S. betas higher, conveniently rate cuts actually at some point help with the NII as well. So I think there's a fair amount of -- there's a range of scenarios, let's call it, in the second half of next year. And so my guess is, Brian, we're going to be having this conversation often with you. And we'll certainly keep you posted as we see some of those scenarios develop or there's more variability. Brian Bedell : That's super helpful. And then just maybe on asset servicing, just maybe an update on how you're seeing the pricing headwinds fold out for this year and also obviously, you typically do get a pricing headwind just from a mix shift towards ETFs, but maybe if you could talk about whether you think that might be set offset by some of the growth in alternatives? And then I know I think there is an expense offset too or I should say, I believe the margin is the same on ETFs versus say, mutual funds, so you again an expense offset, so maybe if you just want to confirm that? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Brian, I think the pricing experience that we're seeing in the industry has been stable and consistent over the last few years, and we expect it to be consistent into next year and beyond. We just have the standard because our contracts are tied to equity markets, when they roll over every four, five, six years, typically, folks are thinking whether they expect equity markets to be. They know we're going to get paid, they're going to pay us more in the coming years, and they want to share some of that. And so there's a partial pricing offset. But it's in the 2% headwind per year on servicing fees and been relatively consistent. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Brian, it's Ron. The mutual fund to ETF shift, the -- I mean there's been some high-profile conversions of mutual funds to ETFs. But that's -- there's not a lot of that going on. More typically, what you're seeing is ETFs being added to lines. And yes, the economics are different, the revenues fees are lower, but also particularly when you're at scale like us, the expenses are much lower. So it's not meaningful in this overall revenue kind of guide that we're giving you. Brian Bedell : Yeah, perfect, great. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. So I'd like to start on capital. So the buyback sends a strong message. Ron, very encouraging to hear about your comments on M&A. But I wanted to clarify that the buyback is up to $4.5 billion. So does the upper end of the range there assume that you're going to see some AOCI accretion and is the quarterly range of $120 million to $200 million still the right way to think about it, if rates are stable? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. The answer is yes and yes, right? If you think about it, we forecasted just you guys just as you have earnings and coming through the P&L, AOCI in that range, $120 million to $200 million a quarter, it bounces around a little bit and it may with movements in rates. But the pull apart has been good to us and will be a nice tailwind. There's some normalization of RWAs, which I mentioned into the first quarter, then there is some RWA growth in our plans because we want to continue to lend more to clients and support more with their foreign exchange or hedging activity so we'll continue to do that. And then there's the buyback. And our plan is just to at pace, get back into our range and that authorization comfortably gets us there. Brennan Hawken : Okay, excellent. And then a couple folks have touched on it before, but maybe if we think about the fee revenue, can you please update us on the impact of market moves to fee revenues and whether or not there also a corresponding impact on the expense side to I'd assume there's at least some degree of impact there? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yes, let me do it this way. I think as we've -- we have been relatively consistent here and I think the guidance will hold a 10% average change in let's call it, an increase in equity markets, right, will typically lead to about a 3% increase in servicing fees, if you have both of those on average. So that's the kind of gearing we have. It's higher on management fees, 10% higher equity and markets tend to be closer to a 5% increase in management fees.  On the expense side, if I -- it moves around a bit, but I think it's a 10% average increase in equity markets. Probably close to let\u2019s say around -- the range around a percentage point increase in expenses could be a little bit less, it kind of depends. But our subcustodian costs are -- have a gearing towards equity markets and fixed income markets, market data, in some cases, does as well.  So it could be half a point, could be a point, and that's part of the what we have in the expense walk and outlook that we have given and in some ways I think we are actually pleased to see that particular expense increase because that particular expense increase comes with a real revenue growth and that\u2019s \u2013 and that delivers EBIT and earnings growth when you bring it all together. Brennan Hawken : Excellent, thank you for that color. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak from Wolfe Search. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So Eric, I actually have a two part if you'll indulge me just on some of the NII guidance. First, I was hoping you could provide just some guardrails on your assumptions for NIB outflow given you're relatively close to the trough that we saw last cycle? And the -- for the second part, just since you alluded to NII stabilizing beyond 2023, even as NID remixing pressures abate and reinvestment tailwinds start to work through the balance sheet, was curious why NII isn't actually growing beyond 2023, is that a function of rate cuts, international mix, any perspective would be really helpful? Eric Aboaf : Alright, well the -- crystal balling into 2024, I got to tell you, we've got a lot of variability playing out right now, whether it's economic, whether it's central banks. And I think I know there's a lot of talk about what's happening in NII, where do we go to, and then does it -- what happens after we get to a peak. So, I was just trying in 2024 to kind of level set that we see stability. There's a scenario where you see growth. There are scenarios where we may not. But it's hard, it's -- you're getting far out on our forecasting and predictions to be honest. So let's come back to that maybe in the middle of the year, that will be a good conversation. In terms of noninterest bearing, you saw noninterest-bearing on average was about $44 billion this quarter. This quarter, meaning fourth quarter, it was down 5% sequentially. It's bounced around quarterly but we see -- I don't know, you could have off the $44 billion, you could have a $4 billion rotation out next quarter. You could see that again into the next quarter. Then it starts to -- or it could be $3 billion and then $2 billion and so on and so forth. So we're -- I think we're at this level where we've seen some amount of rotation. We think it's going to continue roughly at the pace that it's been going. So it could be anywhere between $2 billion, $3 billion and $4 billion a quarter, but you could have some changes to that. What we do think is that we'll continue to see some of it in the first half of the year, and then it just starts to slow down into the second half. And what we've done is to use that kind of base case into our modeling. And it's all factored into the 20% increase in NII that we expect for next year. Steven Chubak : That's great. And my defense, Eric, since you did talk about stabilization, I felt like I had to take advantage of that window of opportunity, to look forward to talking about it a little bit more in the middle of the year. Just one more for me on capital management, I was hoping you could just speak to or give us some insight into the cadence. Should we expect that buyback to be executed ratably or be a little bit more front-loaded here? And just given the commitment or at least early like a strong effort to optimize your capital levels, how are you scenario planning for the Basel IV proposal or update that we should be getting from the Fed early in 2023? Eric Aboaf : Yes. All fair and it's a kind of discussion we have internally. We want to front-load the buyback. You saw us start particularly strong this past quarter. And we want some amount of front loading. On the other hand, it's actually quite stabilizing to the stock to have buybacks on a consistent basis. So, I think we're -- we don't want to front load at an extreme, and we don't want to be ratably flat through the year at the extreme either because it gives, I think, it's a good kind of market practice to have some I'll call it, front loading, but reasonable consistency in the buyback as well. I think then the goal is to get into our target range at pace. And then we'd love to operate in the middle of our range over time. That's kind of how a range is set up. But I think what we always have to do is look out on the horizon is are the economic conditions worsening, right? And so then you may be want to run close to the upper end of the range to insulate and prepare or are they particularly benign and they're particularly good uses of capital, and you might want to be at the lower end. Similarly, I think we'll learn more about Basel III and some of the changes in capital rules, maybe that comes with other changes in capital rules, we don't know. And I think later this year, we'll evaluate and that's another reason to either run towards in different areas of the range as well. So, it all factors in, but I think we're quite comfortable with the direction where we want to go and then like you will -- we'll think about what's on the horizon and plan for that. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great, thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good afternoon guys. Eric, as a follow-up on the stock repurchase commentary, did you guys -- and especially in the sense you referenced it would be more front-end loaded, did you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, we did. And I think what the accelerated share repurchase program typically does is operate in such a way that the stock buyback is accelerated within the course of the quarter, right, within the three-month period. There are typically some benefits of that. You tend to add $0.01 or around that EPS. It's actually interesting in a high interest rate environment, you also lose the NII benefit of the capital. So we've actually found that the ASRs tend to be a push roughly. And so we're -- we often do a more typical buyback within the available trading days in the quarter in a way that's fairly market practice as a way to return the cash and the capital to all of you. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then I know you pointed to the RWA benefit you had this quarter for the CET1 ratio. And I think you said in your slides, you're targeted range is 10% to 11%, which, of course, you're above at this time. Do you have any guidance on when you think you may reach your targeted 10% to 11% CET1 range? Eric Aboaf : It will depend on -- let me say it this way, we want to return the capital at pace and I've given some bookends as to what that means. And that's, I think, a forecast you guys can build off of. And we want to get to our target range, we don't want to wait until, I don't know, next Christmas. That's not the -- that would not be at pace in my nomenclature. At the same time, there's just a range of what will move. If RWAs lighten again, it'll take a little longer. If they go back and we fully utilize our limits in our various businesses and areas, then it might be a little more quickly. So it's hard to pin it down, but as I said, we'd like to get to -- we'd like to execute the buyback at pace. We'd like to get back to a range -- into a range at pace and we're going to -- we're driving that direction. Gerard Cassidy : Great, appreciate it, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi, Well thanks for all the answers on the cyclical factors. I wanted to ask about the structural end game, a strategic end game post Brown Brothers. And the reason I ask, I count five restructurings in the last 20 years. They seem to come around like the softness the Olympics. The fourth quarter is yet one more quarter with notable items, account notable items in 18 of the last 20 quarters. And I do get some of it. Like you have incredible headwinds, mutual funds, markets, technical debt. You've been reinventing yourself front-to-back, straight reprocessing, serving clients, more agile tech. And I also recognize what you said at the start that the ROE and the margin improved for a couple of years in a row. But when I look at fee expenses, that has gone the other way and it seems like maybe one route issue is fixed cost. So really, the question is a concrete question, what percent of your expenses are fixed, how does that compare to the past, I'm assuming they've come down and where would you like to take that? And then more broadly, what is the end game strategy after Brown Brothers? Thanks. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Let me start on that, [indiscernible] there's a lot in there. A comment on -- I'm not going to comment on past restructurings, I'll comment on this one, right. We've made some changes to the way we organize ourselves. We talked about that back in the middle of the year. And there's some benefits we can take out of that in terms of simplifying the management structure, having a smaller number of senior managers, we're going to take advantage of that. It's consistent with simplifying our business. It creates accountability and we stand by the need have done that restructuring. In terms of where do we take this business going forward, it's -- it has a lot of benefits to it. It's very tied to investment markets over time. Investment markets grow, they don't shrink. So the actual, if you will, unit pricing while the unit pricing may go down, overall pricing actually -- overall revenue is actually more times than not have the tailwind. We like that business. It's also one that is changing fundamentally from being a kind of a back office, show me the lowest price kind of thing to much more of an enterprise outsourcing business. We are very new in that. We're very early in that transition. And we think by far, we are the best positioned to take advantage of that in terms of the technical capabilities that we have, the people capabilities that we have, the position we have in the marketplace. We've made initial in roads and wins in that, but there's development that we talked about that will be delivered in 2023 and beyond, but a lot of it in 2023 that will only help strengthen our position. So we see the end game here in terms of the core investment servicing business as being one which is much more akin to an outsourcing services business, much less susceptible to kind of these instantaneous, I'm going to put it to RFP. And it's just a stickier business. And we are very respectful and wary of our competitors because having an edge and a lead can be easily caught up on. But we -- right now, we believe we have that edge and lead, we're going to capitalize on it. In the investment management business, again, similar kinds of changes there. We're seeing an increased desire for the kinds of things that we do, systematic and otherwise. Asset allocation, which we are very, very good at is now an area that everybody is talking about after literally decades of reliance on the 60-40 model, and guess what, it didn't work or it doesn't work at all time. It will lead to a lot of thinking and demand for that. So we like our businesses. We like where we are strategically. In terms of what's going to happen, will there be other Brown Brothers out there. What I do think that you will see over time is an increasing number of competitors where this may not be their core business saying enough is enough. The capital requirements are -- in terms of the investment capital requirements are much too high, mostly above the technology. If it really does continue into an outsourcing kind of environment like we believe it will, it's going to put more demand to invest in the business. And if this is business 42 of your 80 business structure, you might decide you don't want to be in this business. So that's how we see it going forward. Michael Mayo : That was expansive, thank you. And the fixed cost part of the question, you don't report it that way, but just in rough terms, I guess. So in asset servicing, less RFPs, lowest price, this enterprise outsourcing, okay, investment management, more holistic instead of the real old model. But still as you transition, you have a certain degree of fixed costs that are tough to manage. I mean it's not quite like a brokerage firm where you reduced bonuses. So is there any way just to ballpark how much of your expenses are fixed costs and I think they've come down from the past, you're probably trying to floor them more? Eric Aboaf : Mike, it's Eric. All good questions. I think that this section in the industry, which used to be variable cost intensive, right, it was very manual, and when you add a new piece of business, you actually have to hire fund accountants. We're working on ledger paper first and then on the Excel sheets next. And so it's quite manually intensive and variable in nature. It's actually as we've automated, think about the data centers, you've talked about the movement to the cloud, the developers that we have, this business has really evolved to a fixed and semi-fixed cost oriented business in truth. And that means that for certain types of business, we bring on custody business, core custody. Those are kind of the most automated and the most the oldest part of what sits in our franchise, that comes in, you plug it in, and the computers just process a few more times, not overnight, but literally in nanoseconds. And so this has become a more fixed cost business. And so what we need to do is think about how do we want to manage those fixed costs, how are they deployed, the development dollars and technology, how do we shape that each year because we can -- if we do that right, we'll add feature functionality and that will bring in new business over time, that will help retention and that will help growth.  And so this is more of a fixed cost business and semi-fixed costs. Where is it? It's more 80-20 fixed and semi-fixed than 20-80. And I think it actually has evolved. And so what's important for us to do is to make sure that we have the products and the offerings and the client coverage to support that and to add new business, add the right type of new business. And then where there are variable cost components, we've talked about some of the more manual and complex areas. Servicing for private, for example, is still quite manual, it's complicated. They are not standard systems. Typically, in the industry, there are no -- there's very little in third-party software that one could avail oneself of, those are the variable areas where we need to continue to find ways to automate and streamline and that's part of what we're doing with the ongoing investment program that we have underway. Michael Mayo : Alright, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Robert Wildhack : Hi guys. AUC/A wins in the fourth quarter were pretty good. And Eric, you called out a strong pipeline there. What level of new business wins are you expecting in 2023? And do you see those coming from any specific client category, cohort, service area, anything like that? Eric Aboaf : As we have said, the pipeline remains strong. I think we're pleased with wins this year. Wins were about $1.9 trillion for the full year. What I have said is and I think we feel good about this target or line in the sand as we've said, to drive the kind of organic growth that we'd like we want to win about $1.5 trillion per year of new business. We did that this past year, we did it in space closer to double that in 2021. And so -- and that's our expectation. We expect and we think that's par for 2023 as well. Obviously, we want to sell more than that. We want to bring in new -- more new clients or further deepen relationships with existing clients. I think what we feel good about here is both the new business this year, the $1.9 trillion that has come in has come in at good fee rates. The fee rates of the new wins are actually in line with our overall fee rate this year. And so that means that as it on-boards it will be neutral or even accretive to the fee rate. So that's important and that's an important part of the program. In terms of segments, it's been broad-based. I mean this past quarter, for example, was broad-based across regions, literally, I think it was a third, a third, a third and we saw particularly strong growth this past year in Asia. We'd like to repeat that again. I think we got -- we have an intensity on Europe and North America as well. So there's not -- I'd say it's not one particular segment or one particular region. It's fairly broad. But it's a good pipeline overall. Robert Wildhack : Got it. And then you also mentioned some higher renewals in the Alpha business. Wondering if you could talk about the retention rate there, how is the retention among front-to-back clients compared to your more traditional back or middle office only clients? Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Rob, I mean in terms of fully installed Alpha clients, the retention rate is 100%. And you wouldn't expect it to be much less than that simply because it's still relatively new. I think that there's a real commitment that's made on both sides of the house when you enter into these things. First of all, to actually rewire the firm around -- for the client to rewire around front to back. There's a lot of effort on their part. And while there's a lot of commonality across these clients, there's a lot on our part that we need to do to install it. So contracts are longer. But the reality is that the switching costs have also gone up dramatically in these front-to-back things. So we would expect more. But we also recognize that we've got to earn that. I mean we've got -- right now, there's a -- when that happens, there's a huge dependency on the part of the client and us delivering every day. And so we take that responsibility quite seriously. Robert Wildhack : Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Just a couple of little details for you, Eric. You mentioned RWA came down by about $10 billion and you expect to see another decline $10 billion to $15 billion. Any color on what you did there and does it sustainable post 1Q? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Let me just clarify. RWA was lower than expected in the fourth quarter by about $10 billion. And in first quarter, we expect it to reverse, in other words, to move back up by $10 billion, $12 billion, $15 billion. And it's just driven by some of the underlying volatility in our business. For example, overdrafts were lighter than expected this quarter. They moved around by a few billion dollars, and that moves RWA by a few billion dollars each quarter. In the FX book, we run a very sort of a typical forward book 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks forward. And as you have U.S. dollar appreciation or depreciation, you can get you can get $5 billion moves in RWA relatively easily. So that's just the volatility that we saw. We tend to be quite careful to stay within our RWA internal limits. That's why we tend not to have upswings in RWA, but we tend to have these beneficial quarters now and then. And we'll just note them to you so you can model out our capital ratio trends. Vivek Juneja : Great. Second, another little detail for you, your software processing and data, could you parse that into data versus CRD since that's not combined. So you got this big growth rate there? What's going on underneath? How much is data? How much is...? Eric Aboaf : Sure. It's a combination. I mean, the bulk of that is really around Charles River and the franchise that we purchased back in 2018, which has really given us the kind of growth that we had expected. So you can go back and compare the size of the franchise, I think at the last disclosure. I think we probably showed it a year ago and compare it to that software and data line and get a kind of an adjustment. But it's the large majority, I'll say, of that line. Data to us is though a very appealing offering that supplements what's in -- sometimes sold with the Charles River offering sometimes with Alpha and the middle office, sometimes sold as supplemental to just custody and accounting because it's such a high-value and informative kind of window, sometimes for risk management purposes, sometimes for client transparency purposes for our asset manager or asset owner clients. And so it's actually one of the faster growing areas of that area. And that's why we've put it together because it's actually a software type sale, but an important one. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yes Vivek, it's Ron. Let me just add to that because we've done a lot of innovation in this area of new product development, and we do expect that to continue to grow as Eric said, because what -- everybody is interested in simplifying their operations, simplifying and getting control of their tech depth and innovating on the technology side. But in addition, there's a data management, data control in some parts of the world with some investors, it's also location of data. Where does the data actually both move and rest. So this is sitting increasingly -- this is a growth area. It goes beyond asset managers, large asset owners in particular very interested in this. So we see it as a way to extend what we're doing broadly in the Alpha arena. Vivek Juneja : And just to clarify on CRD, Eric, to your comment earlier, when you previously talked about it was growing in sort of the low double-digit range. This was a year or two ago when you were when it was broken out. Is that still the pace at which is just continuing to grow or is that as it matures, slowing down a little bit or is it accelerating any granularity or any color on that? Eric Aboaf : Yes. It continues through odd pace. I'd say it moves around depending on some of the on-premise renewals that still flow through the P&L, high single digits, low double-digits. And what we've done is continued to -- the team continues to drive kind of the core CRD offerings, the -- start with an equity product. It's moved to equity and fixed income, which are now industry, I think, industry at peer levels, in some cases, industry-leading. And then what we've done is supplemented that. For example, we purchased a small company called Markidis [ph], which was kind of a front-end portion of a Charles River type offering. And so we've added a kind of private market area to what I'll call the broader Charles River Complex. So this is an area that I think will continue to grow probably twice the rate of State Street -- it will help lead us forward but also as the tip of the spear of how we engage with clients, new clients, existing clients in broader ways. And that's why the core software, I think, is an important product. And what I think I've been pleased with, especially this year, which has been all over the place economically and politically, right, even with the equity markets up and down, software and software growth, core Charles River, data, private software for private continues to grow in this double-digit range. Low double-digit range through thick and thin, and that helps balance out, I think, the growth dynamic of the company. Vivek Juneja : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. 1That will be for our last question. I'll be turning the call over back to Mr. Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Thank you, operator and thanks to all for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day.",

O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our first quarter financial results. Before I review our financial highlights, I would like to briefly reflect on the eventful operating environment in the first quarter. Investors had to contend with significant market movements and volatility, driven by persistent inflation, continued central bank interest rate increases, and the recent disruption to certain segments of the banking industry. First quarter global financial market performance was choppy. January produced a very strong start to the year with gains across most asset classes, including equities recording the strongest start to a year since 2019. However, investors remained cautious about the prospect of enduring inflation and a potential recession in the United States. February saw that encouraging start recede as strong U.S. employment data led to growing concerns about the persistence of inflation, which in turn saw market expectations for central bank rate hikes increase, fixed income and equity markets declined, and the U.S. dollar strengthen. March saw a continued rise in central bank rates, which in turn drove shocks to both the U.S. regional and international banking sectors and the need to resolve a number of banks. All this drove negative market sentiment, contributing to large inflows into money market funds and a reversal of a number of the macro trends from the prior month. Both current interest rates and rate expectations decreased and the U.S. dollar weakened, although relative calm returned to markets by the end of the quarter. Notwithstanding these events, all told, global financial markets performed relatively well in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year with broad-based gains recorded across global equities, while U.S. treasuries experienced their best quarter since the first quarter of 2020. However, daily average equity and bond market levels both remained significantly below year-ago period with average equity markets down approximately 10%, which created headwinds for our fee-driven businesses impacting our year-over-year financial results, which I will discuss shortly. Before I discuss our financial highlights, I would like to briefly comment on the recent events in parts of the banking sector. As the globally systemically important financial institution, State Street plays a critical role in the world's financial system. Our strong capital and liquidity positions, size, scale, and sophisticated risk management allow us to help safeguard investors and assist in providing market stability during uncertain times. We demonstrated this ability at the start of COVID three years ago when we helped establish the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility and the Main Street Lending Program. During the first quarter, in concert with 10 other large U.S. banks, State Street once again used its financial strength to help assist in stabilizing the financial system through the provision of liquidity to a financial institution in the U.S., reflecting our confidence in the American banking system. We stand ready to support the world's investors and the people they serve during this time of uncertainty through our investment servicing and asset management products, which offer clients opportunities, insights, and liquidity. Turning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation, I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Relative to the year-ago period, first quarter EPS was $1.52, down 3% as the positive year-over-year benefit resulting from our continued common share repurchases as well as significantly stronger NII growth were offset by lower servicing and management fee revenues, which were impacted by weaker average market levels, continued business and personnel investments to support growth, and a loan loss provision related to State Street support of the U.S. banking system, which I just mentioned. Turning to our business momentum, we remain highly focused on continuing to advance our enterprise outsourced solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle, and back-office activities. For example, in March, we announced our agreement to acquire CF Global Trading. This transaction will further expand State Street's current outsourced trading capabilities, giving our firm the ability to provide these services to new clients and markets. Importantly, the acquisition will allow State Street to expand its liquidity providing capabilities and offer a complete global trading solution as part of our Alpha front-to-back platform. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions. AUC/A amounted to $37.6 trillion at quarter-end and we recorded asset servicing wins of $112 billion in the first quarter, about half of which were higher fee rate alternative mandates, consistent with our strategy. Encouragingly, this was our second best quarterly sales performance by projected revenue within the alternative segments over the last six years. We also reported an additional Alpha mandate during the first quarter as this strategy continues to resonate with clients. Our AUC/A installation backlog amounted to $3.6 trillion at quarter-end. At State Street Global Advisors, quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.6 trillion, while flows across our asset management businesses were negatively impacted by the various market factors in the first quarter. We continue to see a number of bright spots where we are focusing our efforts. For example, in the U.S., our SPDR ETF franchise gained market share in both low-cost equity and low-cost fixed income, while we also had strong inflows into our gold ETFs amidst investor demand for safe haven assets. While aggregate flows to cash were slightly negative for the quarter, this largely resulted from seasonal outflow activity in January. However, Global Advisors gathered strong money market inflows of over $24 billion in the latter part of March amidst the market volatility. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity, and capital position remained strong. Our CET1 ratio was a high 12.1% at quarter-end, well above State Street's regulatory minimum. This balance sheet strength enabled us to continue to return capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, while simultaneously supporting our clients and the U.S. banking system. We returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in Q1, including buying back $1.25 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. As we look ahead in this uncertain environment, we remain highly focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet position, while continuing to generate and return capital as part of our previously announced common stock repurchase program of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, the first quarter included a number of significant events in global financial markets and with the global -- with the broader banking industry. While market conditions were volatile, many asset classes saw sequential quarter gains, although asset prices remained depressed relative to the year ago period, which created year-over-year headwinds for our fee-driven businesses in the first quarter. While our year-over-year revenue performance was durable, supported by significantly higher net interest income growth, our results this quarter were below our expectations. We need to do better, and I believe we are equipped and on track to do so by focusing on areas within our control and effectively executing our strategy. In keeping with the strategic priorities I outlined in January, we are driving forward with a number of actions. For example, our AUC/A to be installed is strong, and by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding beginning in 2Q. Within our software and data business, we expect to convert a meaningful number of CRD on-premises clients to more recurring SaaS revenue in the second quarter. Last, given the revenue inflationary environments, we will continue to selectively reprice some services, proactively manage our cost, execute on our productivity efforts, and stand ready to utilize additional expense levers at our disposal. With the focus on accountability and execution of our strategy, I continue to firmly believe in the ability of our diversified franchise to successfully meet the needs of the world's investors and the people they serve, while delivering value for and capital to -- capital return to our shareholders. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our first quarter results on Slide 4. We reported earnings per share of $1.52 for the quarter, which included a $20 million -- a $29 million provision or $0.06 of EPS impact associated with the expansion of liquidity for U.S. financial institution, as we participated in an industry consortium supporting the banking system. We were pleased to do our part. On the left panel of the slide, you can see that our first quarter '23 results reflected the year-on-year decline in both equity and fixed income markets, but was more than offset by strength in net interest income and strong momentum in our securities finance business. EPS was down just 3% as another quarter of significant buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding. Against this challenging backdrop, we again held total expense growth to just 2% year-on-year, even as we continued to thoughtfully invest in product and client growth initiatives. Turning now to Slide 5. During the quarter, we saw period end AUC/A decrease by 10% on a year-on-year basis, but increased 2% sequentially. Year-on-year, the decrease of AUC/A was largely driven by lower period end market levels across both equity and fixed income markets globally, which were both down in the 10% range. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of higher period end market levels and client flows. At Global Advisors, we saw similar dynamics play out. Overall, our first quarter AUM was negatively impacted by volatile markets. Period end AUM decreased 10% year-on-year, but increased 4% sequentially. The year-on-year decline in AUM was largely driven by lower period end market levels and net outflows. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels, partially offset by some outflows. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees down 11% year-on-year, largely driven by lower average market levels, client activity and adjustments, and normal pricing headwinds, partially offset by net new business. Excluding the impact of currency translation, servicing fees were down 10% year-on-year. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average equity market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments. On the bottom panel of this page, we've included some sales performance indicators, which highlight the good business momentum we again saw in the quarter. AUC/A wins in the first quarter totaled $112 billion with about half driven by wins across the growing Alternatives segment, especially in private markets. The fee rate on these alternative wins are generally more than 4 times the total servicing fee average, which makes this a strong win quarter from a projected revenue standpoint. At quarter end, AUC/A won, but yet to be installed totaled $3.6 trillion with Alpha representing a healthy portion, which, again, reflects the unique value proposition of our strategy. Given the planning and preparation since these deals were announced, we expect significant onboardings of this uninstalled AUC/A next quarter. Turning to Slide 7. First quarter management fees were $457 million, down 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting lower average market levels and a previously reported client specific pricing adjustment. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were flat as higher market levels were partially offset by outflows and day count. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, notwithstanding the difficult macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter, our franchise remains well positioned, as evidenced by our continued strong business momentum. In ETFs, we continued to build on strategic growth segments, which is reflected in net flows in our SPDR portfolio low cost equity and fixed income suites. In our institutional business, we saw net outflows while sustaining continued momentum in defined contribution with the Target Date franchise recording inflows of $6 billion. Across our cash franchise, consistent with industry trends late in the first quarter, we saw a flight to quality with significant net inflows worth 7% of cash AUM into SSGA money market funds since the week ending March 10th, which largely reversed the seasonal outflows experienced earlier in the quarter. Turning now to Slide 8. Relative to the period a year ago, first quarter FX trading services revenue was down 5%, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes partially offset by higher spreads. As a reminder, the start of the war in Europe last year caused some unusually high FX trading activity in 1Q '22. Sequentially, FX trading services revenue ex-notables was down 1% with lower spreads offset by 6% higher client volumes. And consistent with the significant increases into industry wide money market flows, our GlobalLink franchise experienced an increase of $20 billion or 13% into its money market cash sweep program during the last three weeks of March. Securities finance performed well in the first quarter with revenues up 14% year-on-year, driven by higher specials activity and an active focus on business returns, partially offset by lower balances, which was consistent with the industry. Sequentially, revenues were up 6%, again mainly driven by higher specials activity, which was consistent with the market and securities lending industry environment. Moving onto software and processing fees. First quarter software and processing fees were down 18% year-on-year and 24% sequentially, primarily driven by lumpy on-premise renewals in the front-office software revenues, which I'll turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down both year-on-year and sequentially, primarily due to a shift away from products with higher fees, but lower returns. Finally, other fee revenue increased $16 million year-on-year, primarily due to positive market-related adjustments and $27 million sequentially, largely due to fair value adjustments on equity investments. Moving to Slide 9. You'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue declined year-on-year, primarily as a result of lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by continued growth in software enabled revenue. Timing of installations will vary quarter-on-quarter based on the size and scope of prior business wins and we expect several SaaS conversions and several on-premise renewals to come through in the second quarter. Year-on-year, our annualized recurring revenue was 16%. Our software enabled revenue was up 11% year-on-year, but down sequentially due to the absence of an accounting true-up in fourth quarter. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We were pleased to report another Alpha mandate win in the asset owner client segment. In addition to the reported win this quarter, we expect significant middle-office installations in 2Q as we've completed the preparations to begin to onboard a portion of a large mandate won back in 2021. Turning to Slide 10. First quarter NII increased 50% year-on-year, but declined 3% sequentially to $766 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by additional client rotation out of non-interest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by higher short term market rates from central bank hikes. On the right of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Year-on-year average assets declined 6% and 2% sequentially. Average deposits declined 3% quarter-on-quarter, which is relatively consistent with our expectation for first quarter seasonality and client pricing preferences during periods of rising rates. Of note, average weekly deposit levels at quarter end increased 5% as we compare with week -- with the week ended March 10. The stress in the regional bank space primarily affected consumer and corporate depositors rather than the institutional asset manager and asset owners that we serve. We, in contrast, saw some risk off deposit inflows at the end of the quarter. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remain consistent at 75%. These are determined by regulatory guidance. U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% to 90% during the quarter, as expected. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower, in the 30% to 45% range, depending on currency. Our international footprint continues to be an advantage. Turning to Slide 11. Our first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased just 2% year-on-year or up approximately 4% adjusted for currency translation. In the light of the current revenue environment, we're actively managing expenses, while continuing to carefully invest in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations automation. Compensation and employee benefits increased 5% year-on-year, primarily driven by higher salary increases associated with the wage inflation and higher headcount attributable to lower attrition rates and in-sourcing. Total non-compensation expenses, on the other hand, decreased 1% year-on-year as continued productivity and optimization savings more than offset increases in certain variable costs and professional services. On a line-by-line basis for non-compensation expenses, information systems and communications expenses were down 2% due to benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, partially offset by technology and infrastructure investments. Transaction processing was down 9%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from declining market levels as well as lower broker fees. And other expenses were up 9%, mainly reflecting the higher professional fees, travel, and marketing costs. Moving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with extremely strong capital levels, which are well above our targets, let alone the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio was up slightly year-on-year, but down 1.5 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 12.1%, which was largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchase program and the expected normalization of RWAs that we discussed last quarter. Tier 1 leverage ratio was flattish at 5.9%. Our LCR for State Street Corporation increased a couple of percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 108% and 4 percentage points quarter-on-quarter to 124% for State Street Bank and Trust where most of our businesses transacted. We were quite pleased to return $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, consisting of $1.25 billion of common share repurchases and $212 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, given the high level of capital across every measure, positive pull-to-par in AOCI and our strong earnings trajectory, we continue to expect to return up to $4.5 billion of capital in the form of buybacks at pace this year, subject to market conditions of course. Turning to Slide 13, which provides a summary of our first quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a very challenging backdrop and the continued competitive strength of our global franchise. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter. At a macro level, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggest the Fed, ECB and Bank of England, all continue to hike to varying degrees in 2Q. In terms of markets, we currently expect average U.S. equity and global bond markets to be up about 1% to 2% quarter-on-quarter and international equity markets to be flattish. Regarding fee revenue in 2Q and on a sequential quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be up 4% to 5% with servicing fees up 1% to 2% and management fees approximately flat to up 1%. We expect to see a significant increase in front office software and data revenues as we have line of sight to a number of on-premise renewals and SaaS conversions in 2Q. In our other fee revenue line, which we know is difficult to forecast, we intend to adopt in 2Q the new accounting guidance recently issued regarding renewable energy investments. We would expect to see a sequential quarter uptick in total other revenues of between $5 million to $15 million, but this estimate always depends on market levels. As we adopt this accounting change, our effective tax rate for 2Q '23 is expected to be approximately 21%. The adoption will be roughly neutral to EPS. Regarding NII, we now expect NII in the second quarter to decrease 5% to 10% sequentially, primarily driven by the non-interest bearing deposit rotation and interest-bearing deposit betas as quantitative tightening and rate hikes continue into 2Q. Turning to expenses. We remain focused on driving productivity and controlling costs in this environment. We expect that second quarter expenses will be flat on a sequential quarter basis, excluding the 1Q seasonal compensation cost of $181 million. Overall, we will offset some of the 2Q NII trends with higher fee revenues as business momentum builds in 2Q and through the year and we continue to actively manage expenses. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the NII side of things. So Eric, maybe you can just kind of walk through how much of that 5% to 10% in the second quarter is simply the averaging effect? And also just -- you made a point in your release about how dollar type (ph) increased since the early March going to the end. What we think about in terms of your expectations for deposit growth both on an end-of-period and average basis going forward as well? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Ken. It's Eric. The largest driver of our NII trends right now, whether it's the fourth quarter to the first quarter or first quarter to second quarter is really the level of non-interest-bearing deposits. Those came down this past quarter about $5 billion. We had expected them to come down about $3.5 billion. And we do a fair amount of forecasting on this. We think about January, February. March, it usually comes through in a U shape and we actually had a -- had some of the opposite play through in March. And so that's what's been driving some of the change in NII. And in contrast, we've actually seen good flows in interest-bearing deposits at the same time. So there is a fair amount going on under the surface. As we look into second quarter, we expect this pace of non-interest-bearing deposits to continue to rotate. So if you step back, last year, we had periods where non-interest-bearing deposits were up $1 billion; then down $2 billion; then down $4 billion; then down $2 billion, right? It's been quite volatile. And right now we're expecting non-interest-bearing deposits probably to come down another $4 billion, $5 billion into the second quarter. And if you think about it, when you earn 5% or more for those kinds of deposits on the asset side and then pay zero, that can be a significant -- that's a significant amount of NII, right? Every $1 billion is worth $12 million, sometimes $15 million per quarter. And so that's what we are seeing flowing through. The hard work we're trying to do from a forecasting standpoint, and forecasting is always hard, is where does the trend -- how does that trend play out and we do some of what you probably do, which is we've looked at the last peak and the last low of non-interest-bearing deposits. The peak was 22%; the last low was 18%. On the other hand, in dollar terms, the last peak was $50 billion, and the last low was about $30 billion, and right now, we're sitting at about $39 billion. And so that's what's really playing through the NII forecast. And then as we play that out, we expect to see some of that non-interest-bearing deposit rotate into interest-bearing deposits, but to be honest, some of our clients who are sophisticated institutions are also looking at some of the other strong rates that they can get either in treasuries or money market funds. And so, at this point in the cycle, with the high level of prevailing rates, we expect deposits probably to trend down another few billion into the second quarter, but this is all kind of dependent on client behavior and activity as we take a look at our forecast. Kenneth Usdin : Yeah. Thanks, Eric. And just one follow-up to that is just that -- the types of changes in client activity, is this a different behavior than you've seen in the past in terms of where the ins and outs are coming from? I mean, obviously, we were all expecting deposits to come down, as were you, and then the events of the last month came through. So are clients just making different decisions with what they're doing with their even operational cash? Or how would you kind of describe what's happening across the client base? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. I think clients are -- the clients (ph) are making a variety of different decisions here. And I think part of what - why we're seeing, what we're seeing is that we've not lived in an environment where interest rates are at 5%, whether you put that at the Fed or in three and six-month treasuries, right? And so clients have a fair amount of alternatives and they're thinking about how to deploy, how to maximize interest and yields for their own clients, especially the kind of clients we have who are -- over time will always be price-sensitive. When it comes to the operational nature of the deposits, you can see from our disclosure and we added some of this, clients are incredibly sticky and stable from an operational standpoint. Operational deposit balances were steady and the operational percentages continue to be very -- in a very narrow band. You have clients with several billions of dollars each often, but they typically have hundreds, if not thousands of individual accounts with very significant transactional and payment flows, and that's why they're categorized as operational in nature. And so that behavior hasn't changed. What we -- that behavior of core custodial deposits is deeply ingrained in the structure of those accounts, the processing we do for them, the avoidance of overdrafts that they always try to -- that they don't want to -- that they don't want. I think what we're seeing instead is clients on the margin will find, for their discretionary, the last dollar of $100 of deposits, they're going to be rate-seeking. And at these prevailing rates, there is -- they're going to look here and there. Now sometimes, we match them with those rates. So we'll offer deposits at exception rates. Sometimes we help them with their sweeps or some of their treasury repo interest. And so there is a variety of different ways we serve our clients and we'll continue to do that. But clearly, at this point in the rate cycle, you kind of have some of the patterns that you and we would expect to have. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, Eric. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS. Please go ahead. Adam Beatty : Thank you and good morning. This is Adam Beatty in for Brennan. Just a quick follow-up on NII, and in particular, the geographic mix of deposits. So you've got kind of fairly steady trends, U.S. kind of going up and a higher beta, as you've called out in the past, and then non-U.S. somewhat going down with a lower beta. Just wondering if you expect based on what you're seeing right now with your clients, those trends to continue. In particular, will we continue to see pressure on non-U.S. deposit balances? And could those betas maybe be going up outside the U.S. as you say, the competing yields are somewhat higher? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Thanks for the question. I think we'll continue to see a range of behaviors across the geographies. I mean, I think the way I would describe them is in the U.S., with prevailing rates at where they are, you have this non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing rotation on one hand. And then you have clients nudging on pricing in general. And we're kind of at that point where clients now have incentives, just like we do, to find a place to settle at with us. I think in Europe and pound sterling, it's still new, right? We've just been at the kind of the first, maybe half, two-thirds of the rate increases. And there, the betas continue to be in that 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% range and are quite attractive for us. They're good for clients because the clients tend to have somewhat fewer alternatives in those international jurisdictions relative to the U.S. on one hand. On the other, there tends to be a more -- there tends to be less price sensitivity on the deposits. And we do expect that to continue. And I think with more rate increases flowing through in the international jurisdictions, that allow us to continue to lag modestly the deposit rates that we offer to see those play through. Adam Beatty : Great. That makes sense. Thanks, Eric. And then just turning to the buyback, pretty healthy in the quarter. You still got the kind of not-to-exceed target out there. So just wondering how you're thinking about that in terms of deposit trends and capital needs and whether some of the disruption in the banking backdrop has maybe affected your thinking around the buyback. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Good question, and it's something that we've been very deliberate and thoughtful about. You can imagine, as we saw the events in March unfold, we've been thinking daily and weekly about how stable is the broader banking system. The starting point for us is we've got an incredibly strong balance sheet, right? Our capital ratios are in the 12% range. That's 100 basis points above the top end of our range, 200 basis points higher than the bottom of our range. It's 400 basis points above the regulatory requirements. And you know many run much thinner in terms of regulatory requirements. And we've always chosen to run with this kind of -- with a healthy buffer. So I think on one hand, the starting point for us is important in our ongoing decisioning around capital return, and we're conscious of that. On the other hand, just like you say, we assess the market conditions and the environment, not for us, because this is not about us. This is about what's happened in some of the other parts of the banking system. We assess those. And if we would had economic and banking conditions like they were at the beginning of March, I think we'd have a -- we'd make different statements around our capital buyback. And so we feel like there has been a fair amount of healing since the beginning, middle of March, and we think that gives us -- that factors into our thinking. And then what we'll do is we'll continue to evaluate conditions, right, if market conditions and systemic conditions get more concerning for the system, we'll -- we may pace these differently if they continue to be at these levels of stability that we're at, we feel confident that, that we can and should continue to proceed. But it will be a week-by-week reassessment. Our buybacks aren't once and done. They're done over the course of the next eight to 10 weeks. And this is one of those quarters where you do them more linearly than not. And so we'll evaluate. But our position of strength is just quite -- I think quite high and gives us a fair amount of latitude. Adam Beatty : Great. Good context. Thanks, Eric. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Could we talk a little bit about the expense outlook and how you're thinking about managing it? I know that you mentioned 2Q specifically, but I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you are thinking about operating leverage either on a total rev basis or more on a fee basis. Really what I'm trying to get at is how you think about the NII piece as we think about operating leverage for the 2Q and for the full year. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Betsy, there is a couple of different ways we look at this. And clearly, we're one quarter into the year. We've started to give some outlook for second quarter, and we need to see how the conditions and the environment plays out because equity markets up or down, bond markets up or down by more than a percentage point or 2 is going to impact our revenues. And so I think it's still early in the year. We set out this year to drive positive operating leverage and continue to look for ways to do that, but we need more information about the external conditions to really see that. I think as we think about the opportunities here though, NII will trend positively for the year, but not as positively as we would have expected. So that's a consideration. You saw that we took up our fee guide for the second quarter, and so that gives us a little more ballast or breathing room or momentum, to be honest. And we'll continue to manage expenses quite actively. I would say in the last year and a half, as NII was up 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, right, we didn't spend that on the expense line, right? We were quite conscious of continuing to drive investment, but also productivity and calibrate it in our expense growth. And so as we look forward, we'll continue to do that, but obviously, with a -- we'll keep track of the direction of revenues and obviously try to adapt where we can. Betsy Graseck : And then just a quick follow-up on the other fee line that you discussed, the $5 million to $50 million increased Q2. Could you just give us a sense of how we should think about the trajectory of that? Are you going to be increasing your investment into renewables and so that should be a growing line in line with increase in investments to renewables? Or is that a one-time step-up in that? So just a little color there. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. It's -- the revenue impact on that line is a little bit of both, and we're still discerning all the specifics in doing the forecasting. In second quarter, we have -- we need to do a year-to-date catch-up. That's how the accounting guidance is written. And then there will be some additional revenues in the third and fourth quarter, not as much as there would be from the second quarter catch-up. So we're trying to map that out. And as the quarter proceeds, we'll try to get a little more guidance out. But that line will tend to have -- instead of kind of being centered around zero, will be centered around a slightly higher number in the coming quarters, and we'll try to get some guidance out on that as we go through all the forecasts. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, gentlemen. Eric, can you share with us how you guys are investing your cash in your securities portfolio in terms of durations that you're looking at? Are you trying to shorten the duration of the portfolio as you reinvest the cash proceeds that come off with every quarter? What's your thinking about that? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it's Eric. We're -- we've been quite careful over the years of running a portfolio with a modest amount of duration. I think it's typically in the two and a half to 2.8 years in that -- that provides us some amount of benefit from what historically has been steepness in the yield curve. It's also given us some ability to create some amount of stabilization in NII without forsaking the opportunity to benefit from interest rate rises, which is what we've been able to do over the last two years. We like that amount of duration because it also protects the income statement as rates fall, and we'll see if that -- if there is -- if there are rate cuts late in the year or next year or the year after that. So that gives us some stability as well. I think what I'd tell you though is, we spend as much time on duration curve shape as we do on carefully also running some MBS portfolios where there is some additional yield pickup, but you've got to be careful in terms of the level of convexity risk that you take. And then because of our deposit franchise, as was mentioned earlier, we're doing this around the globe. We've got about a third of our balance sheets in international jurisdictions, and that gives us real opportunities in pound sterling, euro, Canadian, Aussie dollars et cetera to invest. And we may run somewhat different duration levels in those different currencies. We might be shorter in one, longer in other, partly to reflect our views on the rate cycle and where each of those are. So there is a range of kind of approaches that we take there, and we find that our flexibility gives us some opportunities to deliver some good yields in NII, but obviously being careful. We don't want to stretch for duration. We don't want to stretch for yield. We want to continue to run a conservative portfolio like we have for many, many years. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just a follow-up on your comments about deposits. I think you said that the low point of non-interest bearing were at $30 billion; you're sitting at $39 billion now. And two-part question, where do you -- if rates just stay here, let's say, the Fed doesn't start cutting rates later this year and next year and we get a 4.75%, 5% Fed funds rate, do you sense that the non-interest-bearing deposits could approach that $30 billion on a go-forward basis? And second, on your operational accounts, do you guys have to pay any interest on those accounts? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Let me do that in reverse order. The operational accounts are sometimes interest-bearing, sometimes non-interest-bearing. So there is a wide variety of different pricing structures, but they tend to be -- remember -- and these are thousands of accounts oftentimes for each of our -- for each of the asset managers or asset owners that we custody for. And it's less about the pricing in those accounts than about the nature of the accounts and the payment transactions that clients are funding in effect with the deposits that they leave with us. In terms of non-interest-bearing deposits, I do think we'll continue to see a trend downwards. We saw a $5 billion trend this past quarter, which was $1 billion or $2 billion more than we had expected even back at that early -- even back when we last gave guidance. We expect probably another $4 billion, $5 billion will come out in the second quarter. And then I think we do believe that there is going to begin to be some stabilization. I'd be inclined to think that we'll get to that $30 billion probably later this year, but this is where there is no amount of crystal-balling that we can provide. It's hard to really be sure it could be at that level, it could be around that level. There is -- we've seen movements in non-interest-bearing month by month that are plus/minus $4 billion or $5 billion. Even in April, as an example, we've had days where non-interest bearings were in the $44 billion level, so $5 billion above the recent average and days when they were at the $34 billion level. So it's that kind of range and volatility that we're trying to forecast through, but clearly, the trend's here, and I think the last benchmark of that -- around that $30 billion level may be one that we approach potentially later this year. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Appreciate the insight. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Okay. Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Seaport Global. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the fee income story. You talked about a pretty hefty sequential growth, but not necessarily coming from the servicing line, so -- but you talked about great momentum in servicing and onboarding. So how do we think about the trajectory on the servicing fee line as you onboard? Is it more of a back half story and how are you thinking about full year with servicing fees? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Yeah, Jim. It's Ron. So maybe I'll start here. On servicing fees, we -- as Eric noted, we do expect growth, and it's driven by a couple of things. One is, we've been carrying for a while now a fair amount of AUC/A to be implemented. A lot of that was tied to some systems development that needed to occur that is occurring. So we're expecting to see a hefty amount of that AUC/A to get installed. Secondly, the wins this quarter were -- while it was a low AUC/A amount, it was much more traditional back office plus this very large alternatives, both of which are easier to install, but they take less time to install. So we're actually quite pleased with how 2023 is shaping up from a sales perspective and it's good that it's shaping up early in the year. So with all that, we do expect to have a meaningful amount of servicing fee growth. That coupled with -- depending on what you believe about markets, tends to wash over everything that I'm talking about, but if you believe that there's some kind of market stability, we feel pretty good about the year as we look forward. Eric Aboaf : And Jim, it's Eric. Just to round that out, Ron's covered servicing fees. Management fees should give us some lift as well as we have some equity market appreciation -- equity and bond market appreciation into the second quarter. I think if you go through the trading lines, second quarter is usually good. We'll have to see just how much volumes play through in spread, so -- but you've seen we've been making nice headway given the market volatility with specials and sec finance that will likely continue. In the software and processing line, we had one of the lowest on-premise renewal quarters this -- in 1Q. And that one just varies. If you just you look at some of the materials in the deck, that could be $6 million, it could be $60 million. That was literally the swing from fourth quarter to first quarter. We expect, as we had said, some sizable upticks there as well. So there is a range of areas. And in effect, from a management standpoint, we're focused on every one of the opportunities and businesses and harnessing the client momentum that we've been seeing. James Mitchell : No. Yeah. Sure, Eric. I appreciate all that. But in terms of the sequential increase of 4% to 5%, it seems like a lot of it's coming from some of these lumpy revenue streams that don't necessarily continue further out whether it's other kind of catch-up, whether it's software processes jumping back. But when we think about sort of the momentum in the back half, can that sort of new run rate in the second quarter -- is that sustainable as you gain momentum in some of the more annuity-like revenue streams or do we kind of have to push it out a little longer? I'm just trying to get a sense of beyond 2Q, you have a nice jump in 2Q, but is that really sustainable? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. No, I understand the perspective. I think what I will remind you on software and processing, we had an unusually low print in the first quarter. So the first part of the follow up (ph) in second quarter is rebound and then continuation. On-premise revenues have averaged about $30 million a quarter, for example. That's a reasonable kind of average that one could expect, but we printed $6 million this past quarter. So it's that kind of, I think, rebound we're expecting in the second quarter and then it should stay within the averages. And then beyond that, to your point, there are the more annuity-like areas, whether it's the software enabled, the SaaS revenues in software, whether it's some of the -- we have very flow-oriented FX and securities finance books. And then as Ron mentioned, we're seeing increasing momentum in servicing fees and management fees, and the servicing fee momentum is spread as we've mentioned, both in terms of back office and in middle office, which gives us additional diversity. It's hard for us to predict the second half of the year, and I'll hesitate every April to re-estimate the full year, but I think we'll know more as we get to June and July, and I'll certainly give -- be able to give you an indication. But we've -- we're certainly seeing momentum of activity with clients and expect some of these onboardings to come through. And we think that provides a step-up and then there should be some continuation beyond second quarter that will be positive. James Mitchell : All right. Well, thanks for all the color. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Sharon Leung : Hey. Good morning. This is actually Sharon Leung on for Steven. For NII, I know you noted that you -- it will still be up, but maybe not as meaningfully as the 20% you had guided to previously. Is there any numbers you can put around that, for example, assuming that the NIB rotation continues as expected and you get to that $30 billion number sometime in the year? Eric Aboaf : Yes. I mean, the -- this is where the forecasts just have a wide range of outcomes. I think given the first quarter report and what we expect in the second quarter, we don't think that one can reach that -- at up 20% for the full year. I think what we're wrestling with is just what's the pace of rotation and what's the pace of some of the price sensitivity that we see in the U.S. clients at this point in the cycle. And that's what's harder to determine. So there is a range of forecasts we have. And if I had to kind of share with you, I'd say if one thinks of it in a more dour way and expects more rotation and more price sensitivity, NII could be up 5% to 10% this year instead of 20%. On the other hand, if one's optimistic and believes some of the history, where there is real attenuation in the non-interest-bearing deposits, NII could be up 10% to 15%. So there is a larger range than usual in the forecast that we have. And to be honest, just like I quoted some of the April year-to-date data and the range of levels that we're seeing, we expect that those -- we expect to be -- that there will be quite a bit of range in the outcomes, just really hard to predict. But maybe that gives you some perspective. It's probably a larger range than you're looking for, but we're trying to be as transparent and forthcoming as we can given the facts and the information that we have here. Sharon Leung : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess just a couple of quick follow-ups, Eric. One on NII. I heard all your comments on the -- in the Q&A. Just trying to make sense of, is the customer behavior that surprised you today versus January given that you probably assumed that rates were going a little bit higher than where we were back in Jan, or is it the events of the last month that have changed customer behavior and increased the intensity of repricing? Eric Aboaf : No, I don't think it's really the events of the last month, which are really in very different client segments, different geographies. Those are very different from what we do and who we serve. And we had a little bit of a flight to quality -- not flight to quality; we had a bit of this risk-off sentiment with deposits, but that's just a whole different ecosystem than those clients that we serve. I think what's really happening here and what we've been trying to estimate, but maybe is unestimatable or unforecastable is just how do clients operate when prevailing rates are at 5% in the United States, right? We've not had that scenario in our -- for some of us in our careers, right? But for some of us, going back many, many -- probably two decades. And so the data is thin on that question. And I think what we've seen is back in January, when we had given some of our NII guidance for the quarter, just on non-interest-bearing deposits, we had seen one quarter where they were up a little bit, one quarter where they were down $5 billion. And then the third to fourth quarter, they were down $2 billion, right? So you're in this situation where you're trying to guess, forecast, estimate we can -- we've got to use all those words. And I think we thought we might have reached some attenuation, but we didn't. There was another step of rotation playing through. It's not a rational for clients to do that, and so they've shifted. Now they shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing. They shift across currency sometimes because of their sophistication. I think what's interesting is that we actually got more deposits in the U.S. and we had some outflows in -- or some net reductions in Europe and in Asia. And so you kind of have a real mix out there. And I think what we're realizing is all the data sets we have are actually not -- there is not enough data on this question of deposit or, I'll call it, deposit or pricing behavior because that's what this is about. And that's what we're trying to better estimate. But the clients we're serving, we're continuing to serve, the momentum in the business is clear. And just like NII went up faster than we had thought, I think there is a trend here that it's coming down a bit sequentially. It's still going to be up for the full year, but we'll need to see how much. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just a separate question. I know it's small for you, but the other element that your provision is higher, the credit portfolio rating, remind us of the credit sensitivity that we should expect from the balance sheet from an economic downturn, if there are more rating agency downgrades, like what that means from a credit cost provisioning perspective as we look forward. Eric Aboaf : Yeah. It's good question. I mean, the -- aside from the provision that's calculated using all the CECL techniques and fairly regimented that we had for that -- for the one cash placement that we made, the provision was about $15 million. I think for us, provisions have been in the $5 million, $10 million, $15 million range typically. We've seen a little bit of migration or change in ratings in a half dozen credits, but it's the kind of thing that plays through. And part of that is we have higher prevailing rates, and that puts a little bit of pressure in different parts of the economy and I think it's probably fairly typical. I think the -- we run quite a high-quality and high grade lending book. Even where we're a little more down market, we call BBs down market, right? So we have a ratings distributions that are typically in the A or A- or even better range. So we'll have some sensitivity to economic conditions. You can go back to around the start of COVID, right? A number of banks built reserves, that can give you a sense of sensitivity. But what we feel like we're well reserved now given what we know, both on the economic conditions and individual positions that we hold. It's highly diversified. It's high quality. And we'll obviously -- we'll continue to monitor, but feel like it's reasonably stable with a little bit of drift down situation just given the direction of rates in the economy. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Michael Mayo : Hi. As you know, the markets that\u2019s a little generations (ph) Silicon Valley. And can you just make it crystal clear? I mean, I think I know the answer, but I need you to really explain why this is an earnings issue and not a liquidity issue. And on the earnings issue, just to make sure I heard you correctly, your non-interest-bearing deposits went from $44 billion down to $39 billion. You think base case, it might go down to $34 billion, but the low end of the range, which is possible later this year would be $30 billion. That would be going maybe non-interest-bearing deposits from $44 billion down to $30 billion, that would be $14 billion less than free money. You said it was $12 million to $15 million per $1 billion. So just taking the worst case, you go down to the $30 billion, it hurts you $15 million, we're talking about $200 million of earnings lost which might be around 7% or 8% of your EPS, if you look at kind of a run rate sort of thing. So first, is my math correct there that that is the earnings issue? And then reassure if it's appropriate, that this is not a liquidity issue. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Mike, why don't I start? I think that as you're calculating the worst case, I think your math roughly is correct. We're doing all we can to avoid the worst case, but I think your math and how you get to the earnings impact is right, assuming the -- in effect, 100% margin on the deposits. In terms of liquidity, there is nothing here that approaches a liquidity issue, right? These are custody deposits. As Eric noted, they're operating deposits. They give you a sense and a little more explanation of why we've got X number of clients, but a multiple number of accounts. And if you think about it, a mutual fund company probably has at least one account per fund they have with us, if not more. It's to actually run their funds. If you look at the liquidity coverage ratio, which Eric walked you through, it's up at 124% now. It's actually gone up, not down. So yes, this is an earnings issue and one that we intend to offset to the extent possible with the primary source of our revenue, which is fees as well as continued careful management of expenses. Michael Mayo : And then a follow-up to that. You said you're not changing your buyback. So you have $4.5 billion for the year. You've done $1.25 billion. So you have $3.25 billion left. With the current market decline, that would be 14% of your market cap. So to the extent you see this as a step down, but not life-threatening, what's your appetite toward completing that buyback and how soon are you able to enter the market? Ronald P. O'Hanley: I mean -- Mike, I think Eric explained it well. If you look at our capital levels, and the fact that we held off buying back shares for quite a large amount of -- basically for most of last year, we feel comfortable continuing the buyback. We're obviously conscious of the environment. So we feel comfortable doing that, and we certainly feel comfortable about ourselves, but there is the system in which we live, and to the extent to which the system started to look very different from what it is today, look a whole lot more like or even worse than what we saw in March, we're certainly not going to ignore that. But our -- based on what we know now and our financial strength, we think it's actually quite prudent to do so. And our forecasting puts us -- I mean, we don't think about it in terms of market cap. We think about it in terms of what's our CET1 ratio, our capital ratio, and this will still put us above our range, so -- well within our range, I mean. So this is something that, at this point, we feel very comfortable doing. Eric Aboaf : And Mike, it's Eric. I'd just underscore, right, the capital and liquidity strength and ratios are just incredibly high end with us by every measure that one can see. And we've shared quite a bit of that. And that's the reason why we're comfortable at this point proceeding with our buyback. We'll -- I said in my prepared remarks, we do it through the rest of the year. I said we do it at pace. And even within a quarter, we typically start buybacks the day after earnings and then we will operate and execute on them, subject to market conditions, of course, but we typically execute on them over the eight to 10 weeks of available days during the quarter. So it's -- we'll -- we've got good confidence in the broader system and enormous confidence in our particular position here. On earnings, we'll work through the earnings issue. NII was -- is something that we can figure our balance sheet to earn when rates move up and the balance sheet does give some of that back when rates come down. And we'll obviously continue to drive our focus on fees and manage expenses and drive what really is a multi-year trajectory. Michael Mayo : One last time, crystal clear. So there is nothing about the reduction in the, quote, free money non-interest-bearing deposits or anything else in your results that would give you pause to continue buying back your stock. Eric Aboaf : None. Michael Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Rob Wildhack : Hi, guys. I wanted to unpack some of the RWA dynamics in the quarter. RWAs were up 7% sequentially, but the overall balance sheet, I think, was down 3% or 4%. So can you just give us some color on what was going on there? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Rob. It's Eric. And I think there's some materials on RWA both in the earnings deck on Page 12 and then further back in the addendum. I think if you remember, fourth quarter, we had a particularly low print in RWA, which we had signaled at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. Overdrafts came in lower than expected. Some of the risk-weighted assets associated with the FX books came in lower because of the late December move in dollar rates. And so we had expected a rebound of about $10 billion, $15 billion of RWA from fourth quarter to first quarter. And you saw we got about $8 billion or $9 billion of that. We still came in a little light on overdrafts, which is fine. Part of that is the amount of cash in the system and the cash and deposits that we're holding on behalf of our clients. You see RWA is still down year-over-year, and that's because of a fair number of optimization efforts. We felt like there's real opportunities for us to grow the franchise on one hand, but deploy RWAs in very high-quality and higher returning ways on the other and support our clients. And so we've been adjusting the deployment across the FX books. You think about how much we want to deploy in the forward space and the long-dated forwards versus spot and securities finance, there are different amounts. But we're quite well off when it comes to capital and our plan is here really to continue to find ways to smartly deploy additional capital and additional RWA to drive organic growth. Rob Wildhack : Thank you. And then I appreciate the color on the to-be installed business and the on-prem enterprise trajectory from here, but could you just remind us how long those installs typically take to convert to revenue? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. When we described the installation going into the second quarter, we were describing those as realized revenue installations. So in effect, the way the accounting works typically is when we win, we don't book the revenues, but it's only at the installation date that you begin to book them. So you'll see both the backlog assets under custody in the second quarter begin to come down and some of the servicing and middle office revenues float upwards. And similarly, for the software and data processing areas, you'll see something in that direction as well. Rob Wildhack : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Eric. Hi, Ron. A couple of questions. Firstly, CRD revenues, I know you said it should -- Eric, the on-premise revenue should bounce back in the second quarter, but just want to step back and look at it on a full-year basis, the entire CRD revenues. What is your expectation at this point for full-year growth in that -- looking at all those three subcomponents together? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. I don't -- Vivek, I don't know that we -- in January, we went into that level of detail. I think what we've said in the past is that that there is a range of revenue growth in our different fee categories. We've described back office as growing towards the -- traditional back office growing closer to the lower single-digit revenue growth. We've described middle and front office, which would include CRD at high single-digit growth. There will be years when it could be double-digit revenue growth. So that's what we said about that category -- this category. I think what we see in particular in software is the on-premise revenues over time will -- may not be as heavy, but we do see real momentum in the combination of the software enabled and SaaS. But all in, that should grow in the higher-single digit revenues typically though there'll be some range around that in a given year. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then going back to this question that's come up on the large amount of new business that remains to be installed in servicing, and you said you should see a pickup in 2Q. Ron and Eric, what's your expectation for how much of that do you expect would get installed over the course of this year, 2Q, 3Q, 4Q? And by the time we exit this year, how much should be done? And therefore, what benefit should there be to [indiscernible] from that? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. I think, Vivek, there are a couple of ways to think about that because what happens here is that it gets onboarded on -- in tranches. So we might onboard the assets under custody, administration, but there are multiple services that we're often providing for those assets. So we had a couple of wins over the last year or two years with $1 trillion. Those $1 trillion wins would have had some custody, some accounting, they might have had some performance analytics. They would have had some middle office services in many cases because they were Alpha mandates. So there is three, four or five kind of, I'll call it, revenue installations, right, for each of the balances that sit there when we describe them as assets under custody and administration. I think roughly, our view is that we'd expect about half of the backlog in custody and administration to come through during the course of this year. I'll say that roughly, right? It tends to vary. And then the revenue pieces, it won't be quite at that level because the revenues come through over time as you get the different, I'll call it, layers of services that are provided associated with those -- that assets under custody, administration. But what we'll do is we'll -- I think it's -- that may be some kind of broad perspective. What we'll try to do each quarter is give you more and more visibility as we get to those implementation points because, remember, these are implementations where not only have we configured a front-to-back offering that we've -- that we've designed for clients, but clients need to reconfigure many of their processes and systems in parallel with that to adopt. And so it's a joint effort on both sides. Vivek Juneja : If I may sneak in one more, just CF Global, any color on what that could add to your fee revenue, Eric? And when do you expect that to start to add [indiscernible]? Eric Aboaf : Yeah. I mean, CF Global for us is a very attractive opportunity. We've historically done some outsourced trading over the years in the U.S. and Asia. We weren't particularly large in that space in Europe. This gives us some real heft and credibility in Europe. It's an acquisition that will close likely at the end of the year. So I think it's really a 2024 topic. And we're looking at a business like that between what we have and what we're adding to be in the $30 million to $50 million range of revenues next year. Now, we've got some of that today, but this -- what we purchased in CF Global really is distinguishing in terms of capabilities, product lines, lets us build around what we have and then drive some real incremental growth. And so something we're very excited about because it fits into being the enterprise outsourcer. You do that for a custody, accounting, middle office, front office, and we do it for the CIOs of small and midsized companies. And it's really -- it fits very well with our positions -- positioning and strength. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Mr. O'Hanley for closing remarks. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, operator. And thanks to all on the call for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our second quarter financial results. Relative to the significant volatility experienced by investors in the first quarter, market conditions in 2Q were more subdued and global financial market performance is varied. Global equities generated positive returns for the third consecutive quarter as investors saw continued strength in developed equity markets, but weakness in emerging markets. Fixed income market sell as investors had to contend was still elevated levels of inflation and further central bank rate hikes, including the Federal Reserve raising interest rates above 5% for the first time since 2007. The second quarter was also characterized by falling currency market volatility, which created headwinds for our foreign exchange business. Turning to slide three of our investor presentation, I will review our second quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, second quarter ROE was 13% and pre-tax margin expanded by 1.2 percentage points year-over-year to 29.5%. Relative to the year-ago period, 2Q EPS increased by 14% to $2.17 supported by our common share repurchases, significantly higher NII, strong front office software and data revenue growth and an increase in securities finance revenue. Our results also benefited from the release of an allowance related to the support of a financial -- US financial institution as well as an accounting adoption. Taken together, these factors more than offset headwinds in some of our other fee-based businesses and the impact of higher-than-desired year-over-year expense growth. Turning to our business momentum, in Q1, I highlighted that by strengthening our implementation capabilities, we have a line of sight into a meaningful amount of client onboarding this year. We began to realize the benefits of this plan and onboarded $1.2 trillion of AUC/A during the second quarter, primarily driven by State Street Alpha, underscoring the power of the Alpha value proposition to our investment services strategy and long-term growth. As a result, our AUC/A installation backlog declined to $2.4 trillion, while total AUC/A increased by 5% quarter-over-quarter to $39.6 trillion, both at quarter-end in part as a result of this new business. We also recorded over $140 billion of asset servicing wins in the second quarter, largely driven by strong sales in the desirable asset owner, official institutions and alternatives client segments. Our sales pipeline grew and we expect substantial on-boardings in the coming quarters. We continue to advance and broaden our enterprise outsource solutions strategy across our clients' front, middle and back-office activities, as demonstrated by the expansion of Alpha's capabilities to ETFs, which we announced in 2Q. For the past 30 years, State Street has continuously innovated to support what has become a $10 trillion ETF market. Today, State Street is the largest ETF administrator in the world with more than 2,700 ETF serviced in 13 countries. That long cycle of innovation continues as State Street Alpha now supports the entire ETF lifecycle. By integrating CRD's front office products with State Street's industry-leading ETF servicing capabilities, Alpha now provides a centralized platform for ETFs issuers across the entire ETF lifecycle, including portfolio management, trading and compliance to enable the growth across a variety of ETF strategies and increased speed-to-market. Turning to front office software and data business, our overall CRD pipeline is strong. In the second quarter, we converted a meaningful number of on-prem CRD clients to recurring SaaS revenue, which when coupled with new SaaS client implementations, increased annual recurring revenue by 12% relative to the year-ago period. In addition, Charles River Wealth Management Solution continues to resonate with clients and drove a significant increase in on-prem revenues this quarter. Year-to-date, CRD's wealth-driven revenue has more than doubled as compared to the first half of 2022 and we remain on track to grow CRD's wealth revenue this year. The State Street Global Advisors quarter-end assets under management totaled $3.8 trillion, supported by higher period-end market levels and $38 billion of net inflows from all three business lines, ETF, cash and institutional. Our SPDR ETF business gathered $27 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, including $20 billion of net inflows into SPY, the industry's largest ETF. We also delivered a solid performance in our US low-cost ETF segment, which gathered $7 billion of net inflows in the quarter, continuing to gain market share. Our cash business gathered a solid $10 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, as our US government money market funds benefited from the attractiveness of the cash asset class in the higher-rate environment. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11.8% at quarter-end, well above our regulatory minimum. The ongoing capital generation of our business, coupled with effective balance sheet management and our strong capital position has enabled us to deliver against our goal of returning significant capital to our shareholders. In 2Q, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of capital, buying back more than $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last three quarters to the end of June, we have returned approximately $4.4 billion of capital to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. The strength of our balance sheet was also highlighted with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual CCAR stress test results in June, following which, we announced our intention for the third year in a row to increase State Street's common stock dividend by 10% in the third quarter, subject to consideration and approval by our Board of Directors. It remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our existing authorization for up to $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, financial market conditions in the second quarter were mixed. Although global equities recorded another sequential quarter of growth, there was weakness in emerging markets and we witnessed the negative impact of persistent inflation and further central bank rate hikes on fixed-income markets. Meanwhile, both equity and currency volatility continued to decline. Despite this varied backdrop, we achieved a number of positive outcomes in the second quarter, including meaningfully reducing our asset servicing backlog, further developing our Alpha capabilities, continuing to record new asset servicing wins, driving strong growth in front office software and data revenue and gathering solid net inflows at Global Advisors. And while we reached double-digit year-over-year EPS growth supported by our capital management and the higher interest-rate environment, our results were below our potential. First, while we achieved sequential fee revenue growth in areas of our business this quarter, we need to demonstrate the fee growth every quarter especially as NII. We need to demonstrate that fee growth every quarter especially as NII is no longer a tailwind. And second, we are highly focused on controlling our expense base. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations in order to improve our efficiency and realized productivity growth. We plan to utilize additional tactical expense levers at our disposal in addition to our ongoing structural productivity efforts in order to support our financial performance for the benefit of our shareholders. Now let me hand the call over to Eric who'll take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin my review of our second quarter results on slide four. We reported EPS of $2.17 for the quarter, an increase of 14% relative to the second quarter a year ago. As you can see on the left panel of this slide, revenue grew by 5% year-on-year, driven by the expansion in our front-office solutions area, where we are an industry leader, continued momentum in securities finance business as well as strong growth in net interest income. This growth enabled us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in other fee areas given the relatively mixed macroeconomic backdrop. We also had the benefit of an accounting change for tax credit investments, which simplifies our reporting going forward. While our overall year-on-year fee growth was less than we would have liked to deliver, we did see sequential quarter revenue momentum and a step up in the sales pipeline, which we expect to build upon in the coming quarters and which I'll discuss later in today's presentation. As we drive growth, we continue to prudently invest in the business while remaining focused on managing costs given the current operating environment, and we stand ready to further intervene on expenses should the softness in the global environment persists. Turning now to slide five. We saw period-end AUC/A increased by 4% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and client net inflows. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased as a result of the significant trillion-dollar Alpha installation and higher period-end market levels. At Global Advisors, we saw similar positive dynamics play out in the quarter. Period-end AUM increased 9% year-on-year and 5% sequentially. The year-on-year increase in AUM was largely driven by higher period-end market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, the increase in AUM was also due to higher period-end market levels as well as strong sequential net inflows. Turning to slide six. On the left side of the page, you'll see second quarter total servicing fees down 3% year-on-year as net-new business in the quarter was more than offset by lower client activities and adjustments largely due to lower custody and transaction volume and better than usual pricing headwinds. Positive year-on-year equity markets were offset by the negative impact of fixed-income markets. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 3% primarily as a result of higher average market levels and net-new business slightly offset by better-than-usual pricing headwinds this quarter. We had a more constructive market environment relative to the first quarter as well as a significant onboarding of $1.2 trillion of AUC/A related to an Alpha client in the asset manager client segment, which comes at a modest fee rate, but with services are expected to be added in the coming years. Within servicing fees, back-office servicing fees were generally consistent with total servicing fees and largely driven by the factors I just described. Middle office services fees performance was meaningfully more positive for the quarter. On a year-on-year basis, fees were up 3% primarily reflecting net-new business and up 10% sequentially, largely driven by the installation that I just mentioned. On the bottom panel of this page, we've again included some sales performance indicators which highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. While total AUC/A wins in the second quarter were not as robust in volume terms, client engagement remained healthy and we saw wins across strategic segments, including mandates and asset owners, official institutions and alternatives, which are key growth areas for us as we previously mentioned. The wins including those in the alternatives segment, which are more complex to service come with above-average fee rates. We have also seen a healthy uptick in our pipeline this quarter. Turning to slide seven. Second quarter management fees were $461 million, down 6% year-on-year, primarily reflecting the impact of net outflows from prior periods, a shift of certain management fees into NII as previously described and some pricing headwinds, partially offset by higher average market levels. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 1% as a result of higher market levels and cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well-positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of our three lines of business. In ETFs, we saw very strong net inflows of $27 billion into SPY and our sector suite of ETFs as well as our SPDR portfolio low-cost suite. In our institutional business, we saw net inflows with continued momentum in our well-established index fixed-income and defined contribution franchises. Across our cash franchise, we continue to see strong demand for our money market funds. We recorded net inflows of $10 billion. Turning to slide eight. Relative to the period a year ago, second quarter FX trading services revenue was down 8% year-on-year and 11% sequentially, primarily reflecting lower client FX volumes and lower industry FX volatility. Relative to the period a year-ago, both volumes and volatility were more muted as the start of the war in Europe last year caused unusually high FX trading activity in the first half of 2022. Many clients were also risk-off during the debt ceiling discussions in April and May, with a rebound in June and client volumes falling its resolution. Altogether 2Q is muted. We are optimistic about 3Q, but it's hard to predict. Securities finance performed well in the second quarter with revenues up 9% year-on-year, driven by higher agency spreads. Sequentially, revenues were up 7%, again mainly driven by higher agency spreads as well as higher prime services or enhanced custody revenues from deeper client engagement and specials activity, partially offset by lower balances. Moving on to software and processing fees. Second quarter software and processing fees were up 18% year-on-year and 34% sequentially, primarily driven by higher front office software and data revenue associated with CRD which I will turn to shortly. Lending fees for the quarter were down 5% year-on-year, primarily due to changes in product mix, but up 5% sequentially, mainly driven by strong client demand for lines of credit. Finally, other fee revenue increased $101 million year-on-year, primarily due to a tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market-related adjustments. This includes the impact of the new accounting adoption. Moving to slide nine, you'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 29% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher on-premise renewals and continued growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue as we continue to convert and implant more clients over to our SaaS environment. About 60% of our clients are now on our SaaS platform. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up nearly 50%. About two-thirds of this uptick was driven by wealth management mandates that are becoming an increasingly important growth segment for us. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remains strong for our Charles River development front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased, we had three more Alpha mandates go live, which brings our total live Alpha clients to 15, and as I previously mentioned, we installed a significant portion of assets related to Alpha this quarter. We expect to provide more services related to these assets in the future, helping us increase the share of our client's wallet. Now turning to slide 10. Second quarter NII increased 18% year-on-year, but declined 10% sequentially to $691 million. The year-on-year increase was largely due to higher short-term rates and increase in long-term rates and proactive balance sheet positioning, partially offset by lower average deposits. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by our continued rotation of non-interest-bearing deposit balances and rate pressure in the US back-book, partially offset by higher short-term market rates from international central bank hikes. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during the second quarter. Average deposits declined 2% quarter-on-quarter in line with industry total deposit trends, which also fell by 2% in the second quarter and reflect client preferences to shift some cash to other products during periods of rising rates. Our operational deposits as a percentage of total deposits remained consistent at approximately 75%. Our global floating-rate loan book provides upside at this stage in the cycle and our investment portfolio positioning provides a tailwind as long rates roll through. We now also have the opportunity to selectively add some duration across the curve, as we see good entry points, which could enhance NII over time. Sequentially, US dollar client deposit betas were 100% during the second quarter, leading again to some sequential NII compression. We are now at the point in the US rate cycle where we expect to adjust back-book pricing to accommodate our larger clients, but do so in a disciplined manner and usually as part of a broader relationship discussion, a balancing trade for fee opportunities. Foreign currency deposit betas for the quarter continued to be much lower in the 45% to 50% range. We've also included a new slide in the appendix, page 16 that shows our NII trends over the past few rate cycles. I think it will be -- it will put the larger NII increases and decreases in context, which are driven by many factors, including changes in interest rates, the pacing of hikes, deposit levels and mix, Fed balance sheet changes as well as equity markets. You can see from that page that our recent quarters have come with a much higher than usual level of NII and we are now normalizing to a more typical level of NII that is inherent in our business activities. Turning to slide 11. Second quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 6% year-on-year. Sequentially, excluding seasonal expenses, second quarter expenses increased just over 1% as we actively manage the expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, private markets, technology and operations, automation. On a line-by-line basis year-on-year, compensation employee benefits increased 7%, primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation and higher headcount attributable primarily to operational staff for growth areas, technology staff, insourcing and some lower attrition, lower than expected attrition rate. Sequentially, however, we have managed the headcount to be flat. Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and credits related to vendor savings initiative. Transaction processing decreased 2%, mainly reflecting lower sub-custody costs from vendor credits. Occupancy increased 7% as we relocated our headquarters building temporarily resulting in overlapping costs and other expenses were up 7%, mainly reflecting higher professional fees. Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate our operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remained well above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.8% was down 30 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was flat quarter-on-quarter at 108% and decreased four percentage points quarter-on-quarter, but still quite high at 120% for State Street Bank and Trust. We're also very happy with our performance on this year's CCAR with the calculated stress capital buffer well above the 2.5% minimum, resulting in a continued preliminary SCB at the floor. This demonstrates we have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. In keeping with our results, in June, we announced the planned 10% increase for our 3Q '23 quarterly common stock dividend, subject to Board approval and it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases under our current authorization of up to a total of $4.5 billion in 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. We plan another $1 billion buyback in third quarter. Lastly, we are quite pleased to return roughly $1.3 billion to shareholders in the second quarter '23, consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Turning to slide 13, which provides the summary of our second quarter results. While there is certainly still work to do, we are pleased with the durability of our business this quarter against a mixed and divergent backdrop. Robust expansion of our front office solutions area and continued momentum in securities finance as well as strong growth in net interest income enables us to offset some of the headwinds we saw in the other fee areas highlighting the resiliency of the franchise. Next I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding our third quarter. At a macro-level, while we know that rate expectations have been moving, our rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards, which suggest that the Fed, the ECB and the BOE will all continue to hike in 3Q to varying degrees. In terms of average equity markets, we currently expect US equity markets to be up about 5% quarter-on-quarter as we are expecting equity markets to remain flat from now to quarter-end, and we expect international equity markets to be flattish on average. Regarding fee revenue in 3Q, on a sequential-quarter basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be down approximately 1% to 1.5%, with servicing fees down 1% to 2% as the below-average fee repricing headwinds we saw this past quarter is expected to normalize in 3Q. This will also include a revenue headwind from the previously disclosed client exit. We expect management fees to be up around 0.5% to 1.5%. We expect front office software and data quarter-on-quarter to be down 7%, as we do not expect the level of on-premise renewals in 3Q that we saw this quarter. We expect the other fee revenue line to come in around $30 million to $35 million in 3Q which is higher than prior years but down post the accounting change impact in 2Q. Regarding NII, after three double-digit sequential increases in NII last year, we now expect NII to decrease 12% to 18% on a sequential-quarter basis, driven by lower deposit levels and continued rotation as rate hikes continue into 3Q. Our outlook assumes that average non-interest-bearing deposits declined by approximately $5 billion from 2Q to 3Q. As we look forward to 4Q, we do expect to see some moderation to the amount of deposit rotation as we work through most of our back-book and most central banks begin to pause. With that context, we expect that 4Q NII decline to be much less somewhere in the range of down 2% to 6% versus 3Q, and we expect NII to then stabilize around those levels, but it will depend on market conditions. And our expectation is that 4Q declines in non-interest-bearing deposits will be small as well likely in the down to a $3 billion range versus 3Q. Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment, and we expect to take action in 3Q to bend the cost curve. As such, we expect that expenses will be down 0.5% to 1% on a sequential-quarter basis and intend to continue to actively manage expenses. As always, this is on an ex-notables basis and we're keeping an eye on the FDIC assessment, which could be a 3Q notable item. And as I noted previously, given the accounting changes we adopted this quarter, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22% for third quarter. With that let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, I'd like to sort of double-click on some of the comments that you made about deposits. So you talked about back-book pricing in the US dollar book. Does that mean that we should be thinking about the potential for betas to exceed 100% here when that starts to work through? And what kind of magnitude do you think that could reach? And could you also help me understand the euro because when I look in the financial supplement in the breakout by currency, it looks like the euro deposit costs were up about low 40s bps quarter-over-quarter which seems like a beta that's a good deal, higher than the 50% you referenced. I know there's some swap noise so maybe that's what it is, but could you maybe flesh that out a bit for me? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, sure. Let me start on the on the betas that we saw in particularly on the US book because we are at a period in the interest-rate cycle where we've now had multiple 50 basis points moved. It's been a very strong signal to our clients that rates are much, much higher and much more quickly and much more visibly. And at the same time, they now have because of that highly inverted yield curve, they have real substitute alternatives that they used to not have in the past, whether it's treasuries, whether it's money market, whether it's repo. There's a range of what they can invest in. And what we found is that our larger clients and you know we primarily have large sophisticated clients are quite active and thinking about their alternatives and then that has been accelerated by the swiftness of this cycle and the place that we've come to and the speed. If we think about the US deposit betas, they were in the 80% to 90% range last couple of quarters. This quarter we saw 100% and, yes, we expect next quarter we'll be well over 100% and what's driving that is really a catch-up in the back-book. We have clients coming to us as you'd expect, just like it happens with retail deposits for retail banks, but we have sophisticated large clients coming back and saying, look, some of our lower transactional rate levels or mid-tier rate levels are something that they like us to adjust. And in a way, what I think we -- has played out is that while spreads widened for us on the deposit, but for some period of time, we're now seeing a convergence back to where they would have been. And that's coming through and so what we have in the cycle is actually a number of quarters of below 100% betas, then we get to a 100% beta and then we are going to have a quarter where betas are well-above that 100% level. And it's really a catch-up in the back-book and that's what's playing through. It is what is beginning to drive this higher reduction in NII this quarter, the 10% quarter-on-quarter that you saw. You saw in my outlook, we are expecting 12% to 18% reduction in NII this coming quarter. And if you peel that apart, some of that is the continued rotation out of non-interest-bearing, but some of it and in good part of it is this catch-up in the back-book that's playing through. We do think that over time, we've seen the bulk of that and that will begin to moderate and I'm certainly happy to go into that and some of our perspective as we drill down deeply into our areas, but that's the context. On your other question on euros, we should probably follow up. I think we see betas quarter-on-quarter of about 50%, but we should probably just follow up offline because I think that's deep in the supplement and probably do that with you and the IR team. Brennan Hawken : Okay, no problem. And then another question just quickly on fee revenue. You flagged that the large client migration is going to be part of the outlook. How much of that will be impacting the third quarter delta? And then how much will be -- how should we be thinking about the timeframe for whatever is left and when that would end up playing out? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, I think the broader context, as you recall, Brennan, is that we disclosed that large client deconversion was going to happen over multiple years. We announced it well over a year ago and we described it in our K at about 1.7% of fee revenue. So you can calculate that through. I think in our fourth quarter earnings call in January, I described that we had seen about $20 million on a run-rate come out, but I can reconfirm that. In the next quarter third -- this coming third quarter we'll see about $20 million come out sequentially. And then in the fourth quarter, there's another piece of about another $15 million that will come out as well. And then after that, it's several more quarters before we see the later and final installments. But that's incorporated into our guide. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning, guys. So just maybe staying on the deposit question for another minute. Why do you guys think this catch-up happening now sort of late in the cycle? We've obviously been in a higher rate environment for well over a year. So curious if you can provide more color on particular customer segments in the US that's driving that and sort of the discussions around that? And then maybe as you sort of think about the end state for US interest-bearing deposits, I think, you're at 3.5 or so today. The cumulative beta on that is, I think, is around 70% relative to the Fed funds rate. Should we think of that approaching, I don't know, 85%, 90% kind of how do you think about where that deposit price in the US will stabilize? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's a good question. I mean, we're clearly navigating and living through an interesting environment that we've not seen in two decades, right? You've got to go back pre-crisis before you see 5% prevailing rates. I think if you -- if you also think about how swiftly we've gotten to where we are, that's why we created -- we put some of this information back on page 16 in our materials. You see this cycle has moved twice as far in terms of the uptick in rates in half the time of the last cycle. And so what plays out as that happens is that we always have clients that, as rates move up, they begin discussing with us and engaging with us on what would be appropriate maybe putting in place multiple balance tiers, having discussions about their expectations, we negotiate and so forth. And you can imagine large client discussions occur over three, six, sometimes even nine-month periods. And so if you kind of turn back the clock and say, when did some of those discussions occur, some of them early ones may have started second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, fourth quarter of last year because there was also a perspective among our clients and us for that matter, that rates might continue to 5%, but they might have gone to 4% or 3%, which would have put us and our clients in a different position from a NIM and NII and rate-setting perspective. So I think it's really the speed of this that has played out and on one hand. And on the other, the inverted yield curve gives clients and the prevalence of the money funds and treasuries and so forth, give clients an alternative, right, that's more vivid, I'd say, than in some of the past cycles. And so that's the kind of client behavior. What we have seen is that if you decompose our book, some of this activity is in the non-interest-bearing deposits, which have come down. And some of it is in the interest-bearing back-book because some clients with non-interest-bearing deposits come to us and say, look, can you make them now interest-bearing at a certain rate. And what we've seen is some real segmentation of that book. As an example, the average account in non-interest-bearing, there's about 30,000 accounts. The average account is barely over $1 million. What you can do in some of the analytic work we've done is separate out the higher balance non-interest-bearing clients and client accounts from lower balance ones. Not surprisingly, the higher balance accounts are down year-over-year in balance terms by 70%, right. The large number of smaller accounts are down by 15%. And so this is where what we're starting to work through with the -- what I'll describe is the burn down. How much of the larger deposits and non-interest-bearing have migrated to interest-bearing, right, at what rate. And our perspective is that we are now working through, I'll describe as a catch-up on the back-book. Some of that is non-interest-bearing deposits moving to interest-bearing and some of that is interest-bearing being priced up. And as we think about it, we think that the peak of that catch-up will play out in third quarter as we scan the deposit types, the larger, more sophisticated clients versus the smaller clients. And that's why we expect both the catch-up to continue into the third quarter and likely peak in the third quarter and then begin to moderate in the fourth quarter and to burn down. Alexander Blostein : Got it. And then like just the end game in terms of what you ultimately think US deposit cost is going to look like relative to kind of the 3.5 and the Fed funds at 5? Eric Aboaf : I think it's -- I've not calculated directly on a cost versus rate basis, on a NIM basis, but I guess we could back into it if it'd be helpful to you. As we think about the long range view of NII on our book, I've given some guidance for 3Q NII, for 4Q NII. I think our instinct is that NII will settle in this $550 million to $600 million range per quarter. And if it's helpful, we can try to calculate that back into spread on assets or a spread or a cost of funds on deposits and follow up with you. Alexander Blostein : I got you. That's helpful. Thanks. And my bigger picture question for you guys and to Ron as well as I think you mentioned productivity efforts in light of the fact that NII has clearly become a bigger headwind over the next several quarters and you guided servicing fees down in the third quarter. So as you think about measuring those productivities, are you solving for overall pre-tax margin stability? Are you solving for kind of fee margin stability sort of like ex-NII? How should we think about sort of measuring the productivity efforts in light of a more challenging revenue backdrop? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Yes. Alex, I mean, where we start with is, I mean, because what you're describing is outcomes of the productivity efforts where we've -- and these are not new, these are ongoing. We really start with how do we create more scale in our business. How do we increase speed, lower error rates, increase client satisfaction, take out manual interventions. So the measures that we're using would be the traditional productivity measures and this has been underway now for several years. You've been seeing the results in our -- and we've been able to manage costs certainly relative to others. But in terms of how we think about the business going forward, particularly given that NII is no longer a tailwind in terms of an outcome basis, we really think about the operating leverage, I think, is the key outcome we're managing to, if that's the question you're asking. Alexander Blostein : Yeah, the operating leverage. Got it. All right. Thank you very much. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. Rob Wildhack : Good morning, guys. Just trying to ask about the asset side and the securities book quickly. Decent uplift in yield again plus 21 basis points. Can you give some color, some numbers around the front book, back-book difference there? And how much repricing can sort of assist NII going forward? Eric Aboaf : Rob, it's Eric. There is a good bit of tailwind that comes from the front book, back-book. I think this on a kind of year-on-year basis, long rates were quite constructive from a year-on-year NII standpoint, the long rate tailwind year-on-year was in the $100 million basis. So it's quite substantial. On a quarter-on-quarter, the long rate tailwind is closer to $15 million, $20 million. So it's not insubstantial. And I think as we see some steepness in the curve come back or I guess I'll describe less inversion, we've got some, we've got abilities to leg into duration or curve position or, in some cases, some amount of convexity where we'd find it helpful. From a rate standpoint, like you said, average rates on the investment portfolio in aggregate was 270 basis points or so. The runoff is a good bit below that kind of in the 180 basis point range, so 90 basis points, 100 basis points south of that. And the roll-on that occurs is well above that 270 basis point average is closer to 410 basis points or more. So you've got a nice tailwind there that's playing through. We also have a tailwind on short rates for international currencies. So that's helpful. And then we are -- we continue to invest and think about opportunities across currency from a basis standpoint and so forth and we've got some latitude to do that as well given our global balance sheet. Rob Wildhack : Thanks, Eric. And then one more just on the operational deposits. If I use the numbers on page 10, operational or excuse me overall deposits are down -- operational deposits are down as a percentage of the mix. Conceptually, what would be driving that? I guess I'm confused as to why operational deposits would be down year-over-year more than non-operational deposits. Eric Aboaf : Yes. I think there's a little bit of -- I look at that data and I think you've got roughly similar movements in operational and non-operational deposits. I think what's happening in this part of the cycle is as deposits or I'll say, as cash for our clients is more valuable, right? They are selectively thinking about how much cash do I absolutely must keep in the -- in their custodial accounts. And if you think about it, they make that decision in, I think it's more than 100,000 different accounts themselves, right? It's a very large and disparate set of decisions and sub decisions by 100,000 plus fund managers and many, many fund boards. And so they're trying to see, hey, can I edge it down, and that's why at this point in the cycle, you see total deposits drift down, but also operational. What they end up needing to trade off and the reason why it will level off over time is that they need a certain amount of deposits that they don't overdraw. They -- fund managers really hate the overdraw at the end of day. And then there's also a governor where we engage with our clients on intraday and make sure that they have enough cash to cover their transactional flow and throughput, but we're just at the period where in the core custody accounts, you've got this drift downwards where they're trying to optimize without going too far and that's what you're seeing. But this is expected. We expect the operational deposits to stay comfortably in this kind of 75% range. And it's a part of the kind of custodial operations, which is what makes them so sticky, right, because they need to be there for the very significant daily, hourly and minute-by-minute transactional flows that we are processing on their behalf so that they aren't overdrawn. Rob Wildhack : Okay. Thanks, Eric. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Eric. Maybe just a different attempt of the deposit discussion. So I get clients wanting more yield. I bought treasurers too, we all did. But is there any point where the client profitability discussion has teed. Like are they able to move 100% of non-operating deposits if they want, like what discussions you're having with them about doing more with State Street areas like FX like lending, alpha. But maybe you could update us on what you're doing to try to help impact what seems like you can't impact the deposit side. So is there anything else you can do? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Let me start there, Glenn, and I think Ron will weigh in as well because a number of us have these engaging conversations with clients. I think from a burn down standpoint, let me first take it from that angle is if you think about our $200 billion of deposits, we've got deposits at a number of different price tiers and we have kind of very large sophisticated clients and then kind of that large tail of small and midsized clients. Of the $200 billion, we think there's about $50 billion that we've been very focused on and continue to be focused on. So about a quarter of our total deposits are with these clients that as we've talked about the last couple of questions, there's been a real catch-up on the back book. I described that because of that $50 billion, which is either a very low price or zero price for our larger and most sophisticated clients, where we have these engaging and balance of trade discussions, right? We've around -- we've got about $25 billion that's behind us, where largely, we've repriced those deposits. We've had those discussions and some of those have come with some balance of trade improvements or some commitments on stability on fees, and those are behind us. Included in the outlook that I provide beyond the $25 billion, there's another $15 billion that's underway right now. That's included in my third quarter outlook, right? So that gets us to $35 billion, almost $40 billion of the $50 million. And then there's a trail that we'll still have. And so I think from a client discussion and negotiation standpoint, the third quarter we expect to be the peak. I think what you'll find is that each of these questions on deposits, certainly, rates goes through a pricing committee from a balance sheet management standpoint. But very quickly, those go to the most senior client executives and all the way up to our C-suite because those are large. They're very large and that's where we engage. And I think what you'll see over time is some of that we'll come back through in FX revenues and sec lending revenues and the absence of fee rate reductions in the future, right, on one hand. And on the other hand, some of what we do here is also work with clients on expanding the range of what we do for them when it comes to managing their cash, right? I think some of the reason you're seeing the uptick in cash with in our asset management business because some of those clients say, look, I'd like to be in a cash money market sweep until we've been doing that. You see our repo business continues to do very, very well is actually an add to -- it's a stabilizer to NII or an add to NII on a year-on-year basis and stabilizing and it's a stable source of NII income quarter-on-quarter because we've been able to shift some of the client cash to those areas. So there are some offsets as well there. But that's a bit of a start. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Yeah, Glenn, what I would add to what Eric said is that the -- if you think about over the last four, five years, our focus on pricing has been -- initially was on fee pricing and kind of addressing, if not combating the fee compression and really working that in an institutional way and in a very high skilled way and escalating those -- or elevating those decisions way above where they used to be. Deposits for -- up until this rate cycle really weren't part of that because, I mean, there were times that we would just assume not have had the deposits. We've now integrated that as Eric has implied into that discussion, but also included a full share of wallet analysis. And the part of this is recognizing that these institutions are very large. And when you have a pricing discussion and putting that in air quotes, it really depends on what it is. And what we have worked to avoid is to not have a series of unilateral discussions without understanding and making sure that at the highest levels of our clients, they understand the impact of this. And just reminding them that you have the fee you have because of this assumption on other services that we're going to provide you or some assumption on deposits. And those conversations are actually starting to work well. It's caused a change of process for us, another change of process for us. But more importantly, it's changed in the way how we're engaging and at what level we're engaging with these clients. And so more to go there, but we also think it's a skill, but now developed, will help us through various kinds of cycles going forward. Glenn Schorr : Thanks for all that color. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please proceed. Sharon Leung : Hi. Good morning. This is actually Sharon Leung filling in for Steven. Just on the deposits, outside of the rotation out of NIB, can you talk about the overall trajectory of total deposits, particularly because it looks like more recent liquidity drawdown has come out of RRP instead of deposits. So just wanted to get your thoughts on the expectations for the trajectory on deposits from here in the context of QT treasury issuance, et cetera? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, it's Eric. It's hard to really gauge the deposit changes outright. I think we're a little more focused on the net interest, I'm sorry, the non-interest-bearing deposits where we've signaled another $5 billion likely outflow this coming quarter. That's less of an outflow than in the second quarter. So you're starting to see some of the burn down that I've described. In the external environment, I think, from the H8 reports those banks, we've seen about a 2% sequential fall in deposits. For the trust banks, we tend to have more deposits coming in when deposits in the bank system increase and we have somewhat more coming out when deposit the bank system come out and probably just the absolute sophistication of our clients. So we're -- we expect a downtick in deposits again next quarter, but just been a little more focused on the non-interest-bearing because that's where it makes a big difference. I think there is always some movement in interest-bearing deposits, especially at the higher rate tier because what we're finding increasingly as we get to a little more of this as we expect to get to a time stabilization or at least a little more of a balance with our clients. Now what they're going to do is it's hard for them to move an underlying operating deposit that actually has to cover the hundreds, thousands, in some cases, tens of thousands of transactions that are flowing through their particular account, but sometimes they'll move the thin margin deposits to a treasury. And so we might lose 10 basis points on something and they'll pick up 10 basis points on treasury. So there's some of that that's going on. And I think in truth that's not as dominant as a driver of our NII at this point. Sharon Leung : Thanks for that. And as a follow-up, just on some of the updated capital rules that are coming. I understand you probably won't be able to give much color because we haven't seen a proposal yet. But just in terms of like expected ways you might be able to mitigate some of that impact and which businesses might be more impacted for you guys? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, I mean, there's -- obviously, we're like many waiting to see more from the rules. We've -- the last time we saw Basel III and game draft from either the US or international regulators was several years back. So I think we've -- we expect some higher capital requirements, just hard to tell how much. We do think there'll be effects on different parts of our businesses. So the new rules will come with an operational deposit operational capital charge. That probably will be relatively hard to influence because we actually want to build our fee-driven businesses. And so those, I think, will just come with a capital requirement that's -- that will be an add. There'll be some reduction on the lending book, so that will be helpful. And then I think in particular, while the fundamental review of the trading book will affect the universal banks potentially in a negative way. For us, the sec finance business will tend to be a positive, will be in a positive territory where capital requirements will be less. We'll no longer need to hold capital to indemnify treasury. So they'll finally become economically more rational in the safer areas, right, as they should be. They should obviously -- capital needs to be held for the riskier activities. But we don't traffic in the riskier areas. And I think that, in some ways, that will give us an opportunity to grow those areas that are quite aligned with our client base like sec finance and actually deploy capital more actively. And so I think there'll be a mix of impacts, we're going to see as it comes through, but I like many were -- we're considering what's to come and we'll react accordingly as it does. Sharon Leung : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Amidst Ron, I guess I wanted to come back to your comments on the, basically, the overall revenue per client, if I can sort of summarize it that way. Obviously, there are different components of how clients, the asset servicing clients pay for the business, and there are many different ways aside from the core fees that they can do that. So as you think about that across the client base, I know you have looked at this more holistically across clients over many, many years. But with the deposit beta going up, is that sort of revenue per client going down? Or do you think you're able to actually be able to improve the fee rate given that they aren't paying as much on the compensating balances? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Brian, it's a good question. And what I was referring to and what you're referring to is what I would call how we think about this tactically client by client, but I also want to come back to the strategic elements of this also. In terms of -- there's no one answer for any particular client because if you think about it, in the core back office business, you've got custody fund accounting and there's a pricing element to that along typically with associated deposits. In more and more instances, obviously, we've -- a client might have a middle office assignment with us where we're doing -- we are their back office and obviously going all the way to Alpha. And then there's the question of are we doing FX and securities finance with them? Obviously, FX is a function of are they -- do they have occasion to use FX? And increasingly, most managers do, securities finance manager, line managers. So the reason why I'm saying it's tactical, it's -- there's a holistic conversation that needs to occur here. And it's important on both sides, ours included, to lay out for the client that remember all we did for you over the past few years to get you through whatever fee challenges they were having, that was predicated on X. And X might be an assumed deposit level, it might be on an assumed FX level, X isn't playing out. We need to have a conversation on this. And that could, in cases, lead to more fees or it could and the more typical outcome is that, well, hey, we're not doing this with you, let's try and do that or even there's a set of funds over here that we've never talked about, whatever Cayman Islands or something, and let's see if we can move those. I mean the positive situation is a challenge. The conversations it's spurring are opportunities. And there are real opportunities. There's senior people intimately involved in these because we don't get a lot of redos on them. This is the moment to be doing it. So we think it's a way to, I mean, again, the kind of NII outflow is a significant headwind, but we think it's an opportunity to mitigate some of it. The strategic side of this, Brian, I don't want to lose, right? Because going back to the acquisition of Charles River, the launch of Alpha, all the development we've been doing, we're now seeing onboarding happening there. With the typical onboarding journey tends to be the lower fee complicated kind of middle office stuff starts first. And then there's follow-on services. And it's making sure that we are implementing, addressing and implementing those follow-on services as fast as possible. So when we talked earlier and talked about the onboarding, I talked about that we were able to move a little over $1 trillion into to be onboarded to onboarded. What will follow there is other services and increase kind of the revenue per asset per -- I mean that's the way Alpha works and that's the way Alpha is going to play out, which is why notwithstanding the short-term issues that Eric has raised in terms of we've got this client transition. We're actually quite optimistic over the -- what I would call the short to medium term as we look into 2024 about the revenue picture. Brian Bedell : That's great color. And then maybe just on the expense side, Eric, you mentioned the expense levers. Are they more tactical in nature? Or do you see sort of an ability to reengineer -- continue to reengineer the cost base. You've already done a great job in reducing costs structurally over the last several years. I don't know if we're like mostly through that and when you do have the cost saves you reinvest them in growth initiatives? Or is there an ability to sort of reduce the overall cost structure? Ronald P. O'Hanley: Brian, let me address that first, and then Eric will comment. The -- we are definitely not through this. And by that, I mean, when we started down this journey a couple of years ago, we obviously addressed call it, which you want the lower-hanging fruit, the kinds of things that we could get at without a lot of technology investment, without a lot of reengineering, but there is more to do, and we're making a lot of progress on it. We've got people in place now on both the operations reengineering side and on the technology side that are working this through. The way this has played through in our results, you've seen what our expenses have been, but we've also been able to invest more in the businesses than we otherwise would. And we think that, that journey has more to go, and you'll see that and we'll report on that quarter after quarter. What we also talked about, though, is that there's some tactical things that we can do and should do just given the kind of outlook that we've described to you. And those would be less about reengineering and more about how do we think about short-term things like consensus and those things. Eric Aboaf : And just to round that out, we've got to pay for performance. So when we have larger -- we deliver larger sales, we'll pay for that when it's a little lighter. As you saw, we'll reign that in, and that's part of the execution mines that we have. We've also just given some of the evolution on salary increases and that we've all worked through over the last couple of quarters over the last year. We also feel like it's time where we have enough staff and so we've put in place a hiring freeze because we need to contain our staffing costs. So we need to make sure as we reengineer, we actually redeploy our folks to, say, new business areas or to growth areas and actually pair down others. And the way to do that in a more emphatic way tactically, right, is to be particularly disciplined on hiring, and freeze that or just limit it. And so given the short-term performance, we're doing that as well, which gives you a sense for our willingness to bend the cost curve. Brian Bedell : That's great color. Thanks very much, Ron and Eric. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Well, thanks, operator, and thanks to all in the call for joining us. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead. Ilene Fiszel Bieler : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley will speak first; then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO will take you through our third quarter 2023 earnings slide presentation, which is available for download in the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards we'll be happy to take questions. During the Q&A, please limit yourself to two questions and then re-queue. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our slide presentation, also available on the IR section of our website. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may vary -- may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning everyone. Earlier today we released our third quarter financial results. As we issued these results, the world has witnessed a surprise and unconscionable terrorist attack on innocent Israeli citizens and the resulting enormous human toll in Israel and Gaza. These terrible events have shocked the world and created further global geopolitical uncertainty. State Street stands with the people of Israel and we are united with all those impacted. Now turning to the third quarter, global financial market performance was mixed as a positive start for equity markets in July turned decisively negative as the quarter progressed. Against the backdrop of softening economic data, market sentiment was negatively impacted by continued global central bank rate hikes and investor concerns of a higher-for-longer interest rate environment in an economic hard landing. As a result, equities fell, while global bond yields continued climbing around the world, reaching levels not seen for many years with the US 10-year yield reaching its highest level since 2007. Despite these factors, the third quarter continued to be characterized by relatively low currency market volatility. Turning to Slide 3 of our investor presentation, I will review our third quarter highlights before Eric take -- takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, third quarter earnings per share was $1.25 or $1.93, excluding a loss on sale from an investment portfolio repositioning, which was a notable item in 3Q. EPS growth year-over-year, excluding notable items was driven by our significant common share repurchases during the period, coupled with a 3% increase in total fee revenue. This fee revenue growth reflects higher servicing and management fees, better front office software and data fees, and an increase in other fee revenue. Taken together, the benefit of share repurchases and the improvement in fee revenue more than offset lower NII, market headwinds within trading businesses, as well as the impact of year-over-year expense growth. That said, we are pleased with our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, which help us to contain that expense growth, while allowing us to continue to invest in our businesses. Turning to our business momentum, within Investment Services, total AUC/A increased to $40 trillion at quarter end and we recorded $149 billion of new asset servicing wins during the third quarter, largely driven by wins in Official Institutions and Private Markets. The estimated annual new servicing fee revenue to be recognized in future periods associated with 3Q asset servicing wins amounted to $91 million, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in over two years, demonstrating our ability to achieve our ambition of driving stronger sales performance. Encouragingly, Alpha's momentum continued in 3Q. We deepened relationships with existing mandates and recorded two new Alpha mandate wins, including our first Alpha for Private Markets mandate for one of the world's most influential investors. During the third quarter, we outlined a number of strategic focus areas for our Investment Services franchise, as we aim to drive opportunities across key regions and product areas and realize the full potential of our State Street Alpha value proposition. Importantly, we are taking actions aimed at gaining market share in reinvigorating revenue growth. We are executing against our plan to improve core back-office custody sales performance as it is our largest revenue pool installed quickly has significant scale and drives high-margin ancillary revenues. As an illustration of our custody sales momentum and the power of Alpha. In the third quarter, State Street in Vontobel, a premier global asset manager headquartered in Switzerland, entered into an agreement to expand our existing front and middle office relationship, by providing back-office services, subject to necessary approvals. State Street had no relationship with Vontobel until discussions began in 2020 around Alpha, resulting in the adoption of our front, middle and now back office services. Key client wins such as Vontobel, demonstrate how Alpha can establish, broaden, and deepen client relationships, further positioning State Street as our client's essential partner. It illustrates the value of the Alpha proposition and confirms our strategic rationale of how Alpha can grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capabilities in a true one State Street solution for our clients, from front to back. Accelerating the sales cycle and implementation timeline, particularly back-office services remains an important strategic priority to drive even more fee revenue growth. Turning to our front office software and data businesses. CRD continues to perform well and has a strong pipeline. By the end of the third quarter, annual recurring revenue for our front office software and data business increased by 12% year-over-year to $299 million. At Global Advisors, assets under management reached $3.7 trillion at quarter end, supported by a record $41 billion of net cash inflows in 3Q. Importantly, our cash business gained market share in an expanding market, driven by strong investment performance coupled with a higher yield environment. In aggregate, Global Advisors gathered $10 billion of total net inflows in 3Q. Record quarterly flow performance in cash was partially offset by outflows in the institutional business, coupled with the impact of risk-off market sentiment in our ETF business in 3Q. While our ETF franchise saw modest net outflows in aggregate in 3Q, our US low-cost SPDR ETF franchise continues to be a bright spot, generating $7 billion of net inflows, gaining further market share. To drive continued growth, in 3Q we reduced the price on 10 low-cost SPDR portfolio ETFs, demonstrating our commitment to delivering institutional quality investment solutions at competitive price points. Lastly, on business momentum. I am proud to highlight that State Street's foreign exchange business has once again been recognized as the industry leader. After being ranked number one FX provider to asset managers by Euromoney Magazine in 2022, this year Euromoney Magazine\u2019s 2023 FX Awards named State Street as the winner across four categories, including Best FX Bank for Real Money Clients, Best FX Bank for Research, Best FX Venue for Real Money Clients, and Best FX Bank Sales. Turning to our financial condition, State Street's balance sheet, liquidity and capital positions remain strong. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 11% at quarter end, well above our regulatory minimum. This strength has enabled us to deliver against our goal of capital return to our shareholders. In 3Q, we returned $1.2 billion of capital, buying back $1 billion of our common shares and declaring over $200 million of common stock dividends. This means that cumulatively over the last four quarters to the end of September, we have returned approximately $5.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, through a combination of share repurchases and common stock dividends. As we look ahead in the fourth quarter, it remains our intention to continue common share repurchases, under our existing authorization of up to $4.5 billion for 2023, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, amidst the challenges of the market environment in 3Q, we remain dedicated to driving stronger business momentum and improving fee growth. To that end, in the third quarter, we outlined our sharpened execution plan to the Investment Services business, underpinned by a number of actions aimed at accelerating sales and revenue growth, while simultaneously improving the discipline in accountability for this execution. Our laser-focused on expense discipline also remains high. We have a well-established track record of reengineering our processes and transforming our operations to improve our efficiency and realize productivity growth. In the third quarter, we reduced expenses quarter-over-quarter, and announced another step in our multi-year productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model, while enabling even greater investment in our business. As part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we are streamlining our operations in India, we have now assumed full ownership of one of our joint ventures in the country. This consolidation will continue the transformation of State Street's global operations and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning everyone. I'll begin my review of our third quarter results on Slide 4. We reported EPS of $1.25, which was down year-on-year due to the impact of the $294 million loss on sale in connection with the repositioning of our investment portfolio, which will benefit NII in the future periods. EPS was up year-on-year at $1.93, excluding the repositioning, which you can see on the right-hand side of the page. Turning to the core business, as you can see on the left panel of the slide, total fee revenue grew by 3% year-on-year, driven by growth in our front, middle and back office investment services business, as well as solid management fee performance at Global Advisors. This performance enabled us to offset some of the industry-wide headwinds we saw in our Global Markets business as well as lower NII, given the mixed macroeconomic backdrop in the quarter. Lastly, we remain focused on managing costs in the current operating environment, limiting expense growth to just 3% this quarter and achieving productivity savings as part of our plan to deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Turning now to Slide 5. We see -- we saw a period-end AUC/A increase by 12% on a year-on-year basis and 1% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period-end equity market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter AUC/A increased primarily due to client flows and net new business. While net new business was positive, long-term flows in the asset management industry has been muted, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide. This risk-off sentiment leads to the current headwind across the servicing industry. At Global Advisors, period-end AUM increased 13% year-on-year and was down 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the increase was primarily driven by higher quarter end market levels and inflows of $10 billion. Notably in the quarter, our cash franchise continued to perform strongly, generating a record $41 billion of net inflows, as our competitive performance contributed to market share gains. Quarter-on-quarter AUM increase mainly due to lower quarter-end market level. Turning to Slide 6. On the left side of the page, you'll see third-quarter servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, net new business and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, normal pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2% primarily as a result of lower client activity and adjustments in previously -- in a previously disclosed client transition, partially offset by higher average equity markets. As I've mentioned over the past year, we continue to see lower levels of client activity inflows, all of which impact transactional volumes, leading to a 2 percentage point to 3 percentage point headwind on servicing fees year-to-date. Part of this is the cyclical nature of the servicing business. The full-year effect has ranged from minus 2% -- minus 2% to plus 1 percentage point impact over the last five years. Within servicing fees, back office services were generally consistent in total servicing fee -- fees. Middle office services, which is part of the Alpha proposition had another quarter of good growth. On a year-over-year basis, middle office fees were up 3% and up 1% sequentially, largely driven by net new business. On the bottom panel of this page, we highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter. We won $149 billion of new AUC/A. We onboarded roughly $250 billion of AUC/A in the quarter, primarily in the asset management client segment. And importantly, as Ron mentioned, we achieved new annual servicing fee revenue wins of $91 million this quarter, which will be recognized in future periods. These servicing wins underscore the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. While we've historically only described wins in AUC/A terms, we recently expanded our disclosure to indicate that a healthy level of annual servicing sales is in $300 million range this year. You can measure us against this benchmark. We now have about $2.3 trillion of assets to be installed and about $255 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed as well. Turning to Slide 7, third-quarter management fees were $479 million, up 1% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII. Quarter-on-quarter, management fees were up 4% as a result of higher equity market levels and record quarterly cash net inflows. As you can see on the bottom-right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well-positioned with very strong and broad-based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, we had neutral overall flows, but saw positive net inflows and consistent market share gains in the SPDR portfolio low-cost suite. As you know, we strategically dropped the fees on about a third of our low-cost suite of products and expect more growth in the coming quarters from this action. In our institutional business, notwithstanding net outflows of $30 billion in the quarter, which were primarily driven by client in-sourcing, both our Defined Contribution and Index Fixed Income products continue to drive strategic momentum. Lastly, across our client franchise, we saw record quarterly cash net inflows of $41 billion as we captured some of the cyclical movement of cash in the financial system. I'll just remind you that cash flows can be volatile quarter-to-quarter. Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter FX trading services revenue was down 2% year-on-year, while up 3% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower direct FX spreads and lower FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the growth primarily reflects higher volumes. Industry volatility is down 25% to 40% across developed markets and emerging markets relative to the period a year ago, and down 5% to 10% sequentially, which is presenting fewer trading opportunities and lower spreads. Securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower specials activity and lower agency balances. Sequentially, revenues were down 12%, primarily as a result of seasonally lower activity and the recent industry drop-off of US Equity shoring activity and specials. Third quarter software and processing fees were up 2% year-on-year, but down 15% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Other fee revenue increased $49 million year-on-year, primarily due to the tax credit investment accounting change and the absence of negative market related adjustments. Moving to Slide 9, you'll see on the left panel that front office software and data revenue increased 2% year-on-year, primarily as a result of higher growth in our more durable software-enabled and professional services revenue, as we continue to convert and implant more clients to the SaaS environment, which now accounts for about 60% of our clients, partially offset by fewer on-premise renewals. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher software-enabled revenues. Our sales pipeline continues to grow and remain strong for our Charles River Development Front office solutions products. Turning to some of the other Alpha business metrics in the right panel, we are pleased, we had two more mandate wins in the quarter for Alpha. Most notably, we also had our first Alpha for Private Markets win. We also meaningfully advance CRD's institutional fixed income capabilities. Turning to Slide 10, third quarter NII decreased 5% year-on-year and 10% sequentially to $624 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to the continued mix-shift from non-interest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing, and lower average deposit balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Sequentially, the decline in NII performance was primarily driven by lower average deposit balances and the deposit mix-shift, partially offset by the benefit of higher interest rates, including international central bank hike and our investment portfolio repositioning. The NII results were somewhat better-than-expected due to non-interest-bearing deposit levels coming down slightly less-than-expected, and the portfolio repositioning, partially offset by client repricing, some of which will be delayed and will impact the fourth quarter instead. On the right of the slide, we showed our average balance sheet during the third quarter, with average deposits declining 4% quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative US dollar client deposit betas were 73% since the start of this recent cycle, while cumulative foreign currency deposit betas for the same period continued to be much lower in the 25% to 50% range. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, last month, we executed an NII accretive and capital accretive investment portfolio repositioning exercise to take advantage of both higher yields and spreads, which all else equal, should drive NII towards the higher end of the previously disclosed range of $550 million to $600 million per quarter next year. Turning to Slide 11. Third-quarter expenses excluding notable items increased 4% year-on-year. Sequentially, third-quarter expenses were down 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in the strategic elements of the company including Alpha, Private Markets and Technology, and Operations Automation. On a line-by-line basis, year-on-year compensation and employee benefits increased 4% primarily driven by salary increases associated with wage inflation, higher headcount, and the impact of currency translation. Sequentially, however, we brought headcounts down and we also reduced incentive compensation this quarter, in line with our year-to-date performance. Information systems and communications expenses increased 3%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts, insourcing, and vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing increased 6%, mainly reflecting higher sub-custody vendor costs. Occupancy increased 4% as we relocated our headquarters building, and other expenses were up 4%, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees. Moving to Slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which remain above both our internal targets and the regulatory minimum. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11% was down 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the continuation of our share repurchases and modestly higher RWA, partially offset by retained earnings. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 109% and 120% for the State Street Bank and Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return roughly $1.2 billion to shareholders, consistent -- consisting of just over $1 billion of common share repurchases and over $200 million in common stock dividends. Over the last year ending September 30th, we repurchased approximately 12% of shares outstanding. Finally, a few brief closing thoughts before turning to outlook. Our third-quarter performance was solid with fee revenue growth of 3% year-on-year. We executed on our plan to improve sales capacity and reported $91 million in new servicing fee wins in the quarter, as we look towards our goal of $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee wins in 2024. And as you've seen us do for the last four years, we again demonstrate expense discipline, while continuing to invest in the business. Next, I'd like to provide our current thinking regarding the fourth quarter. At a macro level, our interest rate outlook is broadly in line with the current forwards. We currently assume global equity markets will remain flat from now to quarter end, which implies the daily averages down about 3% quarter-on-quarter, bond markets are also expected to be down about 3% on average quarter-on-quarter. Regarding fee revenue in 4Q on a year-over-year basis, we expect overall fee revenue to be flat to up 1% year-over-year, with servicing fees approximately flat, and management fees to also be flattish. As we expect the year-on-year business drivers, similar to what we saw this quarter. We do expect fourth quarter sales momentum to be similar to the strong sales performance we saw in the third quarter. We also expect that our market businesses will be down modestly year-over-year, given lower volatility. We expect software and processing fees to be up 10% to 12%, largely due to the timing of on-prem renewals and the expected new SaaS installations, and we expect the other revenue line to come in at around $30 million to $40 million in the fourth quarter. Regarding NII, we now expect 3Q NII -- we now expect 4Q NII to be towards the middle of the $550 million to $600 million range we previously mentioned. This includes continued expected rotation of about $3 billion to $4 billion out of non-interest-bearing deposits and the impact of deposit pricing, which we previously noted, but with more stability in the total deposit averages. Turning to expenses, we remain focused on controlling costs in this environment and expect to maintain relatively flat expenses in 4Q quarter-over-quarter. As always, this is on an ex-notables basis, and in this regard, we are keeping an eye on the likely FDIC assessment. And we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 4Q will be around 22%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Thanks, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Mr. Alex Bostein from Golden -- Goldman Sachs, sorry. Your line is open. Alexander Blostein : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Thanks, everybody. Hey, Ron and Eric, I was hoping maybe you can touch on your comments earlier around positive fee operating leverage into 2024, which is definitely very encouraging to hear after a couple of years of very good cost management already. So, as you think about the revenue uncertainty between the markets and customer flows, I guess, what is the range of outcomes you're assuming for fees as you look out into 2024? And if revenues prove to be more challenging than the base case, is there enough room to still deliver that positive fee-operating leverage? Thanks. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, Alex, it's Ron. I mean we're basing that comment largely on two things. One is, we feel like we've got quite good visibility around what we're doing from a cost perspective. So we feel like, we've got a series of initiatives underway that will continue into 2024 on managing our costs, while also continuing the investment program that we've got in place. That investment program includes some investments that will drive revenues in 2024 and beyond. But also the second thing it's based on is some of the actions we've taken around strengthening our sales and sales effectiveness and just pointing to the results we had in Q3, the note that Eric just made to you in terms of the visibility we have on 2024. So those two things, our confidence in expenses and what we believe is a nicely developing pipeline, and it's a set of sales capabilities and processes. I mean, obviously, markets could turn everything upside down, but based on a reasonable market forecast and not necessarily one that's going to be necessarily a tailwind, we do believe we can achieve positive fee operating leverage. Alexander Blostein : That's great. And, I appreciate the new disclosure on the backlog and the revenue backlog, definitely helpful. So maybe within that, can you help us maybe understand the cadence of how quickly some of that $255 million of backlog will sort get converted into service and fee revenues? Is that expected largely over the course of 2024 or some of that is going to spill into 2025? And then ultimately, do you think that's going to be enough to offset some of the BlackRock related outflows and revenues that you still expect? Thanks Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric. Let me answer that from a couple of different directions to give you some texture, because as we think about go-forward fee revenues, right? Part of what matters is installing the backlog. Part of what matters is new sales, right? Sort of maintaining the third quarter momentum to the fourth quarter and into next year, because some of those sales actually come through in the subsequent few quarters. And then, as we talked about back in September, making sure that we're very effective on our retention activities. So every one of those matters. In terms of the backlog, we said there's about $255 million of revenues in the backlog on the -- on servicing fees and north of $2 trillion on an AUC/A basis. The implementation is a little bit different in each of the regards. In terms of revenues, we think about 5%, 10% of that will come through, specifically in the fourth quarter, so that's included in our guide. We expect 50% to 60% of that $255 million to come through next year, and then the balance in 2025. So it's kind of a good mix and aligned with what we'd like. The AUC/A implementation is a little more -- is little quicker. Just sometimes that happens, it's quicker, sometimes slower, that's a little closer to 30% in fourth quarter and around 60% next year, but those will move around as they play out. But we've got good visibility now. And what we've been particularly pleased with on our third quarter sales in particular was that, a lot of that was around back office services. And back office services as you know, are one of the fastest to onboard and implement, and that's going to provide some momentum into the first half of 2024. Alexander Blostein : That's great. Thank you very much, both. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Mr. Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Hey guys, good morning. Eric, just one follow-up, the fourth quarter NII you're expecting to be in the middle of that kind of [indiscernible] zone and then you're talking to the upper-end for next year. I just wanted to ask you to walk us through that direction of travel. Like, what are the factors that start to turn to perhaps a slight positive as you exit the year into next year with regard to either -- is either left side repricing or just deposits getting to the right zones, just kind of walk us through the moving parts? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Ken, it's Eric. As you surmised, there are a number of factors that matters, especially at this point in the cycle. As we transition from declining NII to some level of stabilization, and we see a good rationale for some uptick from fourth quarter into the first quarter of next year. So let me just go through them, right? There is a continued amount of rotation of NIB, non-interest-bearing deposits. We still expect some in the fourth quarter, but we expect that that starts to flatten out at the beginning of next year. We'll see exactly how much and when. It's hard to call and it moves around. We've got quite a bit of visibility into our repricing, especially for our largest and most sophisticated clients, I described that last year. And then we're through a good bit of that. We have -- we execute on some more of it in the third quarter, we expect and we have very good visibility into fourth quarter. And so, the kind of the repricing effects and the catch-up is kind of a bubble that works its way through. On the tailwind side, we then have the investment portfolio rolling through. And the investment portfolio matures $4 billion, $5 billion bonds quarter, you've got the new bonds come on roughly at 200 basis points, sometimes 300 basis points higher than the ones that are maturing. And so, that's what's giving us a positive trajectory. And so it's really those three factors, plus a little bit of lending growth and some of our other actions that we can control that we think starts to shape, a stabilization of NII as we get from fourth quarter to the first quarter, but, it'll depend. There'll be some movements and as you know we update all of you as frequently as we are in public and we'll continue to do that, but those are the trajectories and our expectations at this point. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. Thanks. And my second one is just the costs were, I think, a little better then you had thought and your flat to 4Q also probably little better than the market thought and a slower implied year-over-year rate of growth. Just wondering, have you done anything incremental to slow the organic growth rate of expenses? And is that something we should think about as we go forward as well? Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yes, Ken, it's Ron. I mean there's a number of initiatives underway, as we I think always talked about. We've really got an ongoing productivity that have actions underway, that is comprehensively looking throughout the organization. Some of the things that are underway now. We mentioned what's going on in India. And this India JV bringing that inside and this JV goes back to our early days in India, before we had our own Center of Excellence there. It's going to enable us to eliminate redundancy and eliminate a lot of oversight activities. So we'll be able to take down costs there, take down repetitive costs. We've got a comprehensive look at operating model throughout the business, which is, will start to yield results into next year. We're looking at some -- where work gets done throughout the world and are there places where we can move and combine things, create more end-to-end. So it's a series of things. Some of them -- you know a lot of the easy work has already been done. So some of these things have been -- the work's been underway for a while and we'll start to realize the benefits of it. But we see visibility such that we can make the statements that we are that notwithstanding that, we continue to make significant investments in the business that we feel we can keep our cost in reasonable check. Eric Aboaf : And Ken, I'll just add that the other thing that we have -- we're down on effectively that we talked about over the last quarter or so was our hiring freeze. I mean, what we found is, we've got outstanding individuals and people on our team. And part of what we need to do is, we reinvest in different features of the business or different areas. We actually need to reallocate some of that talent to those areas and actually, at the same time, we need to find efficiencies in others. And so that's been -- well it is -- it is hard work, it's been an effective way to actively manage our team and our human resources. It still means we invest in all that we need to do for new products, functionality, regulatory requirements and so forth. But the reallocation that's born from the -- from this sort of freeze is actually very effective tool for us at this stage in the cycle. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Ken, what I would add to this, I think what we're talking about now is a continuation of what we started going back to 2019, that was rudely interrupted by COVID and everything that occurred coming out of COVID, the disruption, the great resignation, the issues that arose out of that with service quality and where we needed to overinvest to make up for some of the turnover that we were seeing that led to the kind of cost increase that you saw. That's all been normalized. Service quality has stabilized. And so, I would say that we're back on the path that we started back in 2019, and overcome what we saw in the kind of 2021-2022 period. Kenneth Usdin : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, Ron and Eric, and thanks for taking my questions. One question on your expectations for 4Q, Eric. Encouraging to hear that you still are expecting non-interest-bearing to find a stable point here in the beginning of next year. But when you think about your fourth quarter expectations, are you thinking that the typical seasonality that we see in deposits will come through? And is that embedded within the middle of that range of $550 million to $600 million for NII? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. Yes, broadly, but with the asterisks of the seasonality that we've seen, it has moved around a bit, sometimes a little stronger, sometimes it's a little weaker than typical. So we do see a bit of an uptick in a normalization in total deposits. And so we'll -- we've guided to stabilization, maybe we'll see an uptick, we'll see. But -- this is based on really quite deep analysis of our client deposit base. Remember, we managed it on the US dollar, we managed on each of the foreign currencies. We have just an NIB, for example, I think we have 30,000 accounts, the average account size is $1 million. We've seen the trends in the largest, most sophisticated client and largest accounts come down quite a bit. The smaller ones tend to have a flatter line and evolution. So the guide is based on that plus a little bit of the seasonality, and we'll just update as we go. But I think we've started to see some amount of inflection here. But we want to be careful, right? There's still some amount of rotation playing out. There's some amount of balances and pricing coming through. A good bit of which we have a visibility into, but it'll take a little time to just work through it in the next few months and quarters. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. Thanks. And then maybe following up a little bit on Ken's question. I'm sure at this point you're going through the budgeting process for 2024. Do you have any preliminary expectations for what you could be looking at for expense growth -- operating expense growth here in the next year? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's early to do that. You know, we -- I think what gives us confidence and actually the feel of necessity on fee operating leverage is, we need to run the business in a way that is healthy for our shareholders and our various stakeholders at the same time and we need to find a way through that. We certainly have gone through a strategic planning exercise. We do that through the summer, July, August, and September, and we have -- we've got our path forward. We believe both on the top-line and on expenses, it's a little soon to get into that. But we're working through that and part of what we're doing now is actually making sure that we have detailed plans, business-by-business, function-by-function. We run alternative scenarios. We even develop contingency plans and we are also -- we are careful about metering out our spend next year, where we do add to spend, we're going to do that with stage gate. So there's a lot going on right now and we'll come back with kind of a full set of guide -- guidelines and guidance in January. But I think -- we're confident that we've got a path forward here that'll be healthy and fee operating leverage is very good way for us to think about it and I think for you guys as well. Brennan Hawken : Yeah. Thanks very much, Eric. Appreciate that color. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Glenn Schorr from Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Thank you. So we've discussed over time and today that the lower client flows from the market, the whole active to passive trend, and that how disadvantages kind of all of us. Can you talk about what you're seeing in all private markets, both from a servicing standpoint and you sprinkled in a little comment about Alpha for private markets, like bring this to life a little bit? Could this be a growth industry for the next handful of years, just curious on the side of that. Thanks. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Hey, Glenn, it's Ron. Obviously, you know the kind of growth that the private markets have seen, whether it's private equity and more recently private credit infrastructure and we see none of that abating. Private equity may be taking a bit of a pause, but all of the fundamentals point to those industries increasing, and in fact many of the large -- if you look at some of the large multi-asset managers, a lot of their growth is actually coming from privates. Much of that business today remains in sourced and there's very few standards in the business, a lot of it gets serviced in very expensive locations and is not a very good experience for the ultimate LP investors. So it's a very fast growth area for us. And it becomes more important for the sponsors, for the actual firms to actually get their arms around this, because the average ticket size is going down. 10, 15 years ago, the LP investors, typical LP investor was an institution, it was a pension fund, a sovereign wealth gun fund. Today, the average investor is some affluent person that's in some kind of a pooled fund. And so, getting this all right is actually quite important, and the demand is very high for us. We're investing a lot in it, a lot of technology in it. And increasingly, as these firms become multi asset, not just focused on -- in one area, the idea of an Alpha front to back kind of thing and all that's associated with it -- with data becomes very important, both as providers, but also as investors. So the opportunity here is not just the big private providers, but also the big private investors, the sovereign wealth funds and asset owners here. So yes, we see it as a very significant opportunity for us. Eric Aboaf : And Glenn, just add a little bit of the kind of quantitative elements of this. Private markets, broadly defined around the world from a servicing fee standpoint are growing in the 9% to 10% a year. We described our performance, which has been quite strong in that area. And based on our client base and our pipeline, our expectation is that, we should be growing in the 15% range next year. Part of that is because we serve so many large global asset managers who have a wide range, both in traditional products and in privates, right? So they're coming to us, and partly because increasingly we're serving the classic alternative and private organizations, right, who increasingly want to focus on what their core investment process is as opposed to processing. And so, we see more and more outsourcing and opportunities for us from that segment as well. Glenn Schorr : Maybe just one follow-up to all that good detail. You were early on the -- lot of the offshore outsourcing. You were early on hedge fund outsourcing and it helps you on your growth rate over time. Do you have a sense that you're early here, do you think you have a head start and competitive edge on this private front? We just don't see the same competitive landscape, so curious on your thoughts? Thanks. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: It's a little bit hard to tell, Glenn. I think that we are certainly amongst the traditional asset servicers, we think that were early. You've got some of the very focused fund administrators that do some narrow kinds of activities in there, and certainly in terms of offering a full front to back solution that includes data, as far as we can tell, we're the only ones out there. So yes, we think in general we're early. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thank you for all that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ryan Kenny from Morgan Stanley. Your line is already opened. Ryan Kenny : Hi, thanks for taking my question. So the industry has been seeing servicing fee rate pressure for a while. Can you update us on what you're currently seeing in terms of fee rate repricing? And are the newer wins coming in at a lower fee rate than your existing contracts or at a higher fee rate? Eric Aboaf : Ryan, it's Eric. The overall cadence of fee repricings have been stable for us and I think for the industry the last couple years. As you know, back in 2019, we went through a phase of higher repricings, but they've been relatively consistent in that kind of 2% or so headwind level, which is not that different from what it was over the last five years to 10 years. So that's been relatively stable. What we have seen is very good fee rates on new business. And part of that is the discussion we just had in privates, where just because of the nature of the activity, the servicing, it tends to be a manually intensive process. The fee rates are multiples of the average fee rate for our business. And in fact, the last couple of quarters, we've seen fee rates on new business comfortably above the average that we've seen. You can just do a little bit of comparison and we'd be cautious about doing it for every quarter. But take the last few quarters of AUC/A wins, the last few quarters of fees wins and you kind of -- you get to that view. And we've mentioned that in ways in our quarterly reports this year in particular. So I think in some ways, what we've been able to find is that, with Alpha, we bring more to a client across the AUC/A base, right? So we have fees on the front office side, which we disclose separately, but both the middle and the back office, we have complex clients, and so that's been quite fruitful for us. And then the alternatives and privates is a very -- is a much higher fee rate area, just by virtue of that industry. And that together is what gives us some of the revenue kind of momentum that we've seen into the third quarter of this year and we expect in the fourth quarter as well. Ryan Kenny : Thanks, that's helpful. And if we look at the quarter, it looks like the servicing fee rate over average AUC/A did come down a bit. Was there anything driving that? Is that just a function of lower volatility and timing, or is there anything else in that number that we should think about? Eric Aboaf : No, if you just look at the aggregates, remember you've got this kind of effect, where when equity markets are up, right, you kind of have this natural thinning in the fee rate just because of how the fee schedules are structured, right? And they're not -- they're not quite like they are in the asset management business. So no, that's been fairly -- that was expected and in line with the ranges that we've been seeing. Ryan Kenny : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just actually to follow on that last one, Eric. And just doing the math, just -- and if you can confirm if I'm correct on this, the $91 million over the $149 billion is the appropriate way to look at that and that would be 6 basis points as opposed to the $255 million of servicing revenue to be installed over the $2.3 trillion, representing more than -- just like a basis point or so. So, I guess, first of all, is that -- are we -- am I looking at that correctly and is it all characterized as servicing fee revenue and I guess is what's driving that -- is that differential sort of a sustainable type of new revenue win run rate for, I guess Private Markets sector business? Eric Aboaf : Brian, it's Eric. I'm really glad you asked that question because with new disclosure comes sometimes very simple answers and sometimes more textured ones. So what you've done is an analysis. If you look at our fee wins divided by our new AUC/A wins, which on average, over time, I'll stress that will approximate the rates that of the win. The challenge is, in any one quarter, remember, some of what we win is on existing AUC/A business. So Ron mentioned one of the global asset managers, we added back office to that relationship. Those AUC/As were already in our base. Why? Because we had already been doing both front and middle office processing for them. So in a way, those fees wins in the quarter cannot be compared to any of the new AUC/A. That's kind of apples and oranges. On the other hand, sometimes the opposite happens, right? Where we might be adding an AUC/A and a fee that's quite high, one that's quite low, because we're just adding a small service and we've had some of those over the last couple of quarters. So I'll just be -- I'll just be cautious about the quarter-by-quarter map. I'd encourage you over time, we can look at that through time. But, I think what we encourage you to do is take a look at the revenue -- the wins on a revenue basis against the base of servicing fees, right, $91 million in the quarter against the $5 billion of servicing fees is a very healthy amount of revenue. And our ability to maintain that momentum gives you an indication of the kind of sales effectiveness and the growth dynamic that we can create net of the retention rates that we need to manage, too. So I'd encourage you to spend the most time there. You can do a little bit AUC/A wins versus the AUC/A base that gives you another indication. But I'd encourage you to do it in that direction, because you'll get a better indication, I think of our momentum. Brian Bedell : Okay, that's super helpful. And then the follow-up would be on the deposit beta, the differentials between the US and non-US, and we've heard this from the other custodians as well, in terms of non-US deposit betas being significantly lower than US, and just maybe some thoughts on as we move into this -- into 2024 and potentially Europe, maybe even higher for longer versus US potentially. And should we see more aggressive or I say more incremental deposit beta moving through the non-US markets to sort of almost catch up to US or not so much? Eric Aboaf : You know, our current indication in, we're well through the cycle in the US, at least we think so, we'll see. It feels like there's little more to go on the international side and it started later, so it's harder to read. We do see that there are some structural differences in the markets around deposit betas between the US currency and the non-dollar, even for the same clients in some cases. And part of that is just the -- you've got this non-interest-bearing versus interest-bearing construct in the US and internationally you can have just an interest-bearing deposit construct. So, it's a little more -- it's a little more straightforward. So as I've described, we have cumulative deposit betas in the US in the 70% to 75% range and we expect that will flowed up a little more as we kind of -- as the cycle, let\u2019s say, finishes, it could go up another 5, 10 percentage points but it\u2019s starting to level off. In Europe, the \u2013 we are in the 25% to 50% range of cumulative beta, I think could go up another 10 points, maybe 15 points, we'll see, but it's not going to reach the same level that you have in the US based on the indications we have, and the way we both reprice and we see others competitively price in the market. So, fairly, fairly different between the US and the international currencies. And in some way, that plays to -- that's good for us. We know how to manage in both US and non-US currencies. We've continue to have some tailwinds in NII in the international currencies. We obviously need to make sure that we share some of that with clients, but given the international composition of our balance sheet, that's one of the areas that continues to be supportive of our -- in a positive way of our NII trajectory. Brian Bedell : Thanks very much. That's great color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, I guess, good afternoon. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. One, on capital, I think I heard you regarding competing up to $4.5 billion in buybacks for the year. Can you give us a sense with the CET1 at 11% close to your target, how are you thinking about capital management going into next year? Would you rather operate with some amount of excess capital as you look forward to some of the macro uncertainties, relative to just continuing buybacks and paying out any excess? Eric Aboaf : Let me start on that, Ebrahim. We -- it's Eric. Capital is one of the most important elements of the balance sheet and we spend a lot of time thinking about what are the levels of capital? How to manage? It is based on facts and circumstances, right? The economic environment, the uncertainty, our confidence in earnings and earnings momentum, what we can see in the strength of our balance sheet, right? We're incredibly liquid, and we have a very up-market lending book, which is quite high-quality. So many, many things come together. I think what we've laid out on the page on capital in the material is that, our minimum requirement is 8%. We tend to run with a very healthy buffer above that. We've got a target range in the 10% to 11% and we've been way above that range probably because of a little bit of history over the last two years and we've bringing that down, but in a -- both at pace and also in a thoughtful way. I think what you'll see us do, and I say this is -- given what we know today, because we're going to be careful. If markets disrupt, then you slow a little bit. If you've got a lot of confidence in markets fees and there's confidence, then you might go in the other direction. But the middle of that range is a good place for us to aim towards, partly because you want to keep a little bit of extra, that's still 2.5 percentage points above the requirements. On the other hand, there are some uncertainties in the world and doesn't feel like we should run down to the lower end of that range right now, right? That feels like it wouldn't be -- it wouldn't be appropriate. So there's a range for a reason, I guess is what I'd say. We've been returning capital at pace in the last few quarters, billion dollars or more. We'd certainly like to continue to return capital at pace. You can kind of do the math of 11%, go down to the middle of the range. You got to remember there's pull to par that matters from the AFS portfolio that provides a tailwind and capital accretion, there's earnings. And then there's RWA management. You saw RWA pick up a little bit this quarter. Our goal is obviously to continue to optimize RWA and turn that into an advantage as well. So we see quite a healthy buyback going into the fourth quarter. We've got authorization, plenty of authorization to deliver on that. We know it's important to our shareholders and I think, a good path forward. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thanks for walking through that, Eric. And just a follow-up, quick question around NII, I guess, as you're thinking about [Alco] (ph) management. Is there -- as things reprice on the asset side within the securities book, are we kind of holding duration relative to where the back book is? Will at any point the thought process evolve to adding duration? I'm just wondering, how you're thinking about this cycle, the environment we might be for the next few years, and how that informs the duration you're willing to take on. Eric Aboaf : Ebrahim, the answer is all the above. So every one of those factors matters. If we get more steepness to the yield curve, right, that would encourage us to add some duration. At the right time, we want to -- we may need a little more duration to protect against falling rates, right? That's even ideally be ahead of that. On the other hand, rates could move upwards further and so you want to be careful. I think we're careful in how we've configured the portfolio. You saw us do some of the repositioning. We unwound $4 billion or $5 billion of bonds. We reinvested towards the middle of the curve, but also at the front end, right? We have -- so it's not just an average duration position that we are focused on, but where are the points across the curve? And then there's a whole window of work that we do around the US curve, the Euro curve, and then the other foreign currencies. And then there's also a mix of duration -- clean duration we put on through treasuries and some of the convexity products like the agency MBS. So there's a wide range, but it's an active discussion, I'd say, at ALCO, and one that we think will both be -- we think of it both on an economic basis, but also on a risk management and protective basis, that we'll have, I think, quarter-to-quarter. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Steven Chubak from Wolfe Research. Your line is already open. Steven Chubak : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Eric, I want to ask a follow-up on the new revenue disclosure. In the past, you spoke about the level of gross asset flows that would be needed to offset natural attrition in the business. In a similar vein, I was hoping you could frame the level of gross revenue wins that are required to offset natural attrition, recognizing per, I think it was Brian's earlier question that, fee rates will certainly vary depending on new wins, but any way you could frame it in that context would be really helpful? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, here's what I described. You know, in the past we've talked about AUC/A wins. We had talked about $1.5 trillion of AUC/A wins a year. That's kind of a -- kind of volumetric benchmark. And as some of the discussion we've had, typically we've been winning on average higher than the current fee rate and so you can kind of work through that. On the fee revenue side and this is really around servicing fees, our goal for this year, 2023 is to deliver about $300 million of servicing fee wins. And you can compare that to the $5 trillion of -- sorry $5 billion of servicing fees for the year and that kind of gives you a sense for I'll call it gross revenue wins. As Ron described, we've got a series of initiatives, some of which are already playing through around adding to sales capacity, sales effectiveness, product feature functionality, and so forth. And part of the disclosure that we provided just last month was that, while $300 million of servicing fee wins is appropriate for this year, we'd like to get closer to $350 million to $400 million next year. And again, you can kind of compare that to the $5 billion of servicing fees, and that kind of gives you a sense of gross fee revenues. I think the follow on work you'd want to do is, just think about the other drivers of servicing fee revenue growth on a net basis, right? There is typically some amount of attrition. We said we'd like to have retention at 97%. So you can think about 3% servicing fee attrition, that's about $150 million a year, is a way to compare the gross wins versus the gross losses. And then there's some amount of fee headwinds, which is about 2% a year that we've described. So what we're trying to do is create clarity for all of you on the elements of that growth -- kind of the growth algebra. I'll say it in an analytic manner, so that you can see where we're really focused. And every one of those levers matter. We have tense efforts on each one of those, but it's that mix of activity and the sales, the servicing fee, sales in particular, that will help us then deliver core organic growth from year to year to year. And a good way for, I think, us internally to be clear about what we need to accomplish and externally with you all as to what the bar is for good organic growth and success. Steven Chubak : No, thanks for that color, Eric. And if I could just squeeze in one more clarifying question. There was a lot to unpack in the response to Ebrahim around Capital Management. It does appear, given the 4Q buyback level, assuming you execute on the $4.5 billion in its entirety, you'll be at the lower end of that 10% to 11% range of CET 1, recognizing there'll be a pull-to-par benefit. But should we be anchoring to the 80% to 100% payout that you guys have managed to in the past, just recognizing that there's not as much excess if you're going to run at those levels? Eric Aboaf : I think for the rest of this year, the analytics I'd encourage you to do is to think about where we ended third quarter, kind of the middle of the range and that's not necessarily a point, but there's a range to the middle of the range. For fourth quarter, there's pull-to-par, there's RWA management. That gives us quite a healthy amount of buyback. And I think the continuation of something that's quite accretive to shareholders, that is substantial in terms of capital return. I think once we get to the middle of the range, then we're more likely to be that over 80% level of earnings. But I think that'll be probably how we think about next year. But that's next year. I think there is -- I think we have good visibility into a good and healthy amount of capital return and comfortably over what we've committed to, I'll call it the medium term. Steven Chubak : Really helpful, Eric. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Brown of KBW. Your line is already open. Michael Brown : Hey, great. Thank you for squeezing me in. So, multi-part question on the asset management business. So, first, it was just great to see the money fund flows come in this quarter and you mentioned that you believe there were some market share gains there. Can you just touch on what contributed to those gains and maybe some thoughts on the coming quarters? And then I look at the equity side, and consistent with the industry, there was pressure there on the flows. What's your thoughts on maybe when investor sentiment could improve and flex there? And then just last part here, when you take a step back and you look at SSGA today, is there anything strategically that could be interesting to you from an M&A perspective to help bolster the asset mix or accelerate some of the future growth potential in the business? Thank you. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, Mike, it's Ron. So lot there in your question. I think, on the cash business, I mean, this is a core competency that we've had for a long time, and it's also we've built up the capability both on the investment side and really on the distribution and channel side. So we've got a distribution and, if you will, kind of hooks in the water in many different pools and that's including by the way, lots of connectivity into the core custody business. So as you've seen, for example, rotation from deposits, we've captured some of that in the money market business, but the -- a lot of it -- most of it has been external, most of it has been around investment performance and kind of being where the money is flowing. The other areas that are also growing, DC is growing, and it's been growing for a while. Share has continued to grow there in the DC investment only, and that's been very much product and product innovation-driven. SSGA was one of the first to figure out how to put an annuity product into a target date fund. Did it actually before it got the broad regulatory go-ahead to do that, and that's actually now a source of real growth. So we see that as a growth area, as the defined benefit just goes away and people realize that longevity protection is something that people need. I think that combination of a target date fund with some kind of an insurance longevity product will be important and we've got real distinctive expertise in that. In terms of the growth areas, I mean there is -- we are really, for the most part, an institutional shop. We've built out the product capabilities in the retail and the intermediary space. Yie-Hsin Hung, who joined us as CEO late last year, she's got a lot of expertise there too. So some of it will be just moving and expanding share in the retail intermediary space. And then there's a real move into the -- into blending the line between public and private markets and the belief that those lines really don't make sense. And that blended products where you get sufficient liquidity would enable those that don't need the liquidity to take advantage of the illiquidity premium. So some of this will be in product design, whether that's organic or inorganic, I mean, we think there are opportunities in both. And there is -- the team has got lots of product development going on. So we're fully committed to that business. We see lots of growth in that business and are excited about the prospects there. Michael Brown : Okay. Great. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is already open. Michael Mayo : Hi. Well, it's been a long journey for you guys to get the Front to Back solutions and Alpha. And I'm just trying to figure out how much traction that has and where we're seeing that in the financial results. I hear your excitement, and you have alternatives now as part of that program, and you're guiding for positive 2024 fee operating leverage, and you have all these new mandates. On the other hand, I look at the fee growth this quarter and it wasn't that great, right? And so, are we seeing evidence of the Front to Back momentum in the results? Is it something that you expect to see, or is it simply such a long sales cycle that we should be thinking two, three, four years out? Thanks. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Mike, let me just start and maybe address the journey here, because this was not something that you bought off the shelf. It was actually something that nobody had ever done before. So there was an awful lot of development that we need to do, and I think we signaled that at the beginning. I mean, Charles River was an important acquisition. But to be clear, that was the front, and it itself needed some investment, particularly in the fixed-income area. So, much of what we've been doing over the last several years is selling and developing. Many of the early -- particularly some of the early large ones were explicit development partners. We targeted them, they targeted us and came in as development partners with the idea that they would help us to build this out. They've been purposely taken longer because they're the ones that are actually helping to shape what the overall thing will look like. This has been a very big year. Eric alluded to it in terms of some of the features and functionality, particularly around fixed income, and getting up to not just par, but to a market-leading position in terms of fixed income capability. So in terms of just getting the program up and running, we're actually quite pleased with where we are. I don't think we would have thought back in 2018, 2019 when we launched this, that we'd have the number of clients that we do now. The other thing that we were convinced of, but we had to prove it to ourselves, was that this could be a tool to actually generate new clients, that it wasn't just a way to solidify existing relationships, but it was a way to actually grow share and shift share. And that's what we're starting to see now. Vontobel was one, there's others in the pipeline. So it's a journey that we believe will see revenue growth at accelerating. And maybe I'll leave it there. Eric Aboaf : And Mike, it's Eric. On the financials, it's a very fair question. I just remind you the context for the current year, because there are some other large movements on servicing fees. So if you think about it, we recorded a 1% growth in overall servicing fees, but there were tailwinds and headwinds away from the kind of organic new business creation -- that -- that's important that we need to demonstrate year after year. The market tailwind for year-on-year for this quarter was about 4 percentage points of servicing fees. So you'd say, hey, where is that? Part of that was about 3 percentage points of headwind came from lower client volumes and activity, right? A little bit of what we described as, we've seen less trading activity out there, which comes and goes, and tends to be cyclical. And then the other thing we did see this year and this quarter is that previously disclosed client exit was worth almost 2 percentage points as well. So there are -- I think, some larger headwinds and tailwinds in particular flowing through the financials, net new business, right? If we just want to take a look at that, was a positive 2 percentage points, year-on-year this quarter and that's where we'd like to see the value of Alpha, the value of traditional servicing fee sales, the value of private servicing fee sales. And part of the reason why we're adding to our disclosure is to make that more apparent to everyone over time. Michael Mayo : And then just one follow-up, Eric, and then Ron, just the exit of that large client, what inning are you in as far as that's concerned? And then Ron, as relates to accelerating revenue growth from the long journey of Alpha timing, are we thinking quarter here or several years? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, on the previously disclosed client, we're about 30% through that very roughly. The bulk of that will come through next year and then there's another -- there is just because of how year-on-year comparisons work, you'll get a tail into 2025. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: And Mike, just -- can you clarify your question? I just want to make sure [Multiple Speakers] Michael Mayo : Yeah, my initial question was fees aren't growing that much and Eric identified some headwinds to that. But you talked about the financial benefits from Alpha, the increased activity to result in accelerating revenue growth. I was just wondering a timeframe around that statement that revenue growth should accelerate due to the benefits of Alpha? Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, so, I mean, as we signalled I think at the beginning, I think probably -- I think it was out -- my answer to Alex. We're telling you that we believe we're going to achieve positive fee operating leverage. There's revenues there and there's expenses there. On the revenue side, we believe we've got a program in place that includes Alpha, that's going to enable us to do that. Some of that's driven by Alpha, some of that's driven by actions that we're taking, some of which have been implemented, others that will be implemented this quarter and into next in terms of strengthening sales and revenue-related capabilities. So what you should be hearing from us is confidence around our revenue growth generating capability. Michael Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Ronald P. O\u2019Hanley: Some of it is related to Alpha, and some of it is related to the core business. And what you should also -- and the point we normally don't go into a client example that we did there, but it's such a pure example of the strength -- the Vontobel example is such a pure illustration of the strength of Alpha because it's an institution we had no relationship with. We began the relationship with Front and Middle office, and then we brought along the Back office, which itself, as you know, Mike, as well as anybody, generates other kinds of ancillary revenues. So that's an illustration of how Alpha is enabling us. We believe, to pick up share that we wouldn't otherwise be able to pick up, and to do it in a way that's distinctive from our competitors. Michael Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is already open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Eric. Hi, Ron. Eric, can you share with us, I know -- I'm not asking to go into details on your budget for the upcoming year, but could you frame out for us though, the outside factors that influence the budgeting process on expenses such as wage inflation or other types of inflation? Do you feel that there's less pressure going into 2024 versus this time last year when you were doing your 2023 budget? Eric Aboaf : Gerard. It's Eric. Yes, the headwinds have lessened. They're still there, but they've lessened. If you think about it, when we were doing the budget for 2023, it was the fall of 2022. We actually, at that point had done two formal merit increases that year, some of which were going to then play through on a carryover basis for 2023. So that was partly a headwind. And then we had a larger than probably typical merit increase by a little bit in the spring of this year in 2023. So that's -- we're not in that environment anymore. We certainly want to reward our employees with annual merit increases, but much more in line with what we've done over the last 5 or 10 years, as opposed to something that was much higher. So that's on the kind of wage side benefits. We're actually continuing to see some amount of inflationary activity, medical claims, dental, et cetera, as you'd expect. I think that's pretty broad-based. So, that's probably similar to prior years. And then I think the interesting area, where we're doing a lot of work on is all non-personnel spend, right. Our various partners and vendors and software licenses, cloud computing costs, every one of those is an area for us to think about what's appropriate. And so we have -- we've been having those discussions this summer and this fall, and we'll continue to have them into the winter around next year. Are we seeing inflationary increases the way we were a year ago there? A little bit less so, but I think we're still seeing higher than we'd like inflationary increases there. And so important questions are how do we offset them? How do we use technology if it is a little more expensive to drive, increasing process engineering and automation? How do we partner with fewer suppliers in some cases and get the benefits of our scale? So there's a number of initiatives that we're working through, but that's one that takes some work in a way, that's part of what we do during the budget process. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, our industry, the world has gone through incredible turmoil in the last three or four years with the pandemic and such. And now we're in this interest rate environment that we have not seen since prior to the financial crisis. And if we assume that the Fed is higher for longer, let's say it's 4% to 5% for an extended period of time versus the 0 to 25 bps that you all had to operate and the industry operated on post-financial crisis going into where we are today. How is that -- or is it changing some of the strategies you may pursue, now that the rate environment is not -- possibly not going back to the 50 basis points that we are accustomed to? Does that change the way you approach the business or approach your customers that you couldn't do because rates were at this level three or four years ago? Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it's Eric. I think it has several impacts on us, which actually in aggregate tend to be positive for how we manage and engage on our business. Very tactically, higher rates and especially some steepness in the yield curve we talked about earlier give us some ability to add duration and feel like that's valuable. So there's some tactical effects there. I think more broadly with higher rates, the value of cash in our ecosystem, we described trillion dollars of cash in our ecosystem across deposits, money market and cash sweeps in our asset management business, our repo activity, our platform sweep activities a trillion dollars. To us, cash is valuable for our clients to keep, especially in risk-on versus -- or especially in risk-off versus risk-on environments. And they want to be rewarded for it, but it also means there's a whole cash wallet out there that for us is a way to engage with clients, right? We as a bank who've got not only the banking offering of deposits but the capital markets offering of repo, the money management offering of money markets and cash management. To us, it's a way to deepen our relationships with clients. And I think over time, you'll see us add to our product offering, some of that's quite broad today, but we'll think about how else do we integrate cash into, say, the Alpha proposition is a way to consider it. How do we think about it in terms of our platforms and our market activities? A number of those are important cash generators. And then, I think, at the most senior levels with our clients, the C-suite actually cares about cash today. They care about who they keep it with, how it's managed, how they are renumerated, how it's safe, but also how it can be redeployed. And so it's become a real C-suite discussion in a way that we think can strengthen both our relationships, given our broad offering, but also one that becomes more and more of a business activity and a business growth activity over time. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will hand over the conference to Ron O'Hanley. Please proceed. Ronald P. O'Hanley: Well, thank you, operator. And thanks to all on the call for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change.  Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As I reflect on 2023, the operating environment was dynamic with a complex set of challenges for the world's investors and for our industry, and I am proud of how we carefully navigated State Street through various headwinds, while continuing to execute against our strategic agenda. We focused and delivered on that agenda in three key areas; achieve strong sales wins across our businesses, drive strategic change in our investment services business and remain disciplined on productivity and broader cost management. Further on that last point, during 2023, we implemented key productivity actions and announced additional efficiency measures that will enable us to enhance the productivity of our operating model in 2024 and the years ahead. We took these many actions all while investing in our business and returning substantial capital to our shareholders, which helped to drive full year earnings growth excluding notable items. The world's investors, State Street and our industry, faced a host of significant market events and macroeconomic forces in 2023. In the first quarter, turmoil in the banking sector ultimately led to the resolution from several banks, which was a catalyst for some of the largest fixed income market moves seen in decades. In the second quarter, anticipation grew about the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence, helping to drive equity markets higher. However, as we progress into the third quarter and as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to the highest level in 2022 years in July, the prospect of higher for longer rates led to a substantial sell off in bond markets with the US 10-year treasury yield exceeding 5% in October, for the first time since the global financial crisis. Rate uncertainty and an increasing number of geopolitical concerns caused equities to struggle. Then during the fourth quarter, the equity market rallied vigorously as inflation receded and investors grew increasingly optimistic about a soft landing with positive sentiment gaining further momentum in the last month as the Federal Reserve signaled a pivot to lower interest rates this year. In sum, while our full year overall financial results benefited from higher interest rates globally last year and despite the strong market appreciation in the fourth quarter, daily average global equity markets only increased by low single digits in 2023, providing just a modest tailwind to our fee revenue, while client activity was muted as investors stayed on the sidelines for much of the year. And even in such an eventful year, equity and FX market volatility continued to contract creating revenue headwinds for our trading businesses. Slide 3 of our investor presentation provides some of our highlights for the year. Beginning with our financial performance, full year earnings per share was 5.58 or 7.66 excluding notable items. Year-over-year, excluding notable items, EPS growth was supported by $3.8 billion of common share repurchases, a record level of NII, continued growth of our front office software and data business and higher securities finance revenues. The combination of which more than offset the impact of lower servicing and management fees and underlying expense growth, which was still well controlled. We continued to build business momentum and position State Street for longer term success. To that end, we achieved a number of important accomplishments in 2023, as you can see on Slide 3. A key highlight of today's results is the clear progress we're making on innovation and advancing product capabilities, which in turn contributes to stronger sales momentum across our broad franchise aimed at generating better fee revenue growth in the year ahead. Within the Investment Services business, we are intensely focused on ensuring better execution against our strategy and revenue goals. We unveiled the sharpened execution plan last year, underpinned by a number of measurable actions aimed at driving servicing opportunities across key regions and product areas, realizing the full potential of our Alpha value proposition and accelerating sales and revenue growth, particularly in our core back office custody. Encouragingly, as I just noted, today's results demonstrate our proven ability to deliver the level of sales required for attractive organic servicing fee revenue growth for the future as we built upon the $91 million of new servicing fee sales in third quarter by recording $103 million of new servicing fee wins in 4Q, which is the highest level of quarterly new servicing fees in recent years. From its inception, we have noted that Alpha will further establish, broaden and deepen client relationships, positioning State Street as our client's essential partner. Alpha distinctively enables us to grow and tie together the full breadth and depth of State Street's capability as a true one State Street solution for our clients from front to back. 2023 was an important year for Alpha software delivery. Last two quarters of the year included the significant development of the fixed income portfolio management module, which propel CRD and Alpha capabilities and competitiveness forward. In 3Q, we recorded our first Alpha for private markets client. And in the fourth quarter, we continued Alpha's momentum by deepening relationships with a number of key existing mandates and recording four new Alpha wins, while our front office software and data business had a record quarter of new bookings in 4Q, both demonstrating our ability to drive stronger sales. Within our Global Markets business, even as low volatility created a headwind, we continued to see proof points of our very strong market position. For example, in its 2023 FX awards, Euromoney Magazine named State Street as the winner across four important categories, including the best FX bank for real money clients. We also continued to innovate and strategically expand our product capabilities and geographic reach, including the planned acquisition of outsourced trading firm CF Global Trading. At Global Advisors, we undertook targeted strategic actions aimed at gaining market share and driving occupancy growth in the coming years. As a result, we saw encouraging business momentum with GA setting a number of growth records in 2023. A number of key performance indicators make us optimistic as we look ahead. For example, in Q4, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate total flows, including record quarterly flows within our SPDR ETF franchise, amounting to a capture of 21% of total global ETF flows in Q4 and ending 2023 with a record level of total ETF assets under management. Our cash business had an exceptional year delivering record annual flows in 2023 with institutional money market fund AUM also reaching a record. Overall, we gained market share in a number of key areas, including institutional money market funds and US low cost equity and fixed income ETFs. Turning to our efficiency and productivity efforts. Underlying expense growth was well controlled in 2023 with full year expenses increasing 3%, excluding notable items. Q4 expenses, excluding notable items, rose just 1% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting the impact of our ongoing expense actions. Transforming our operations to improve effectiveness and efficiency and realize productivity growth remains a key priority for us. To that end, we announced important steps in our multiyear productivity efforts aimed at improving our operating model. As we previously announced, we are streamlining our operations in India. We have now assumed control of one of our joint ventures in that country with a second joint venture consolidation expected to close in spring. We expect these actions will accelerate the transformation of State Street's global operations, improve service quality and client experience and enable us to achieve productivity savings as part of our plans to deliver positive free operating leverage in 2024. Turning to Slide 4 of our presentation. You can see our fourth quarter financial highlights and business trends and indicators, which Eric will shortly take you through in more detail. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength, which has enabled us to return substantial amount of excess capital in recent quarters. For example, over the last five quarters to the end of December, we have returned $6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders. As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return, in 2024, it is currently our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases, subject to market conditions. Accordingly, as we announced this morning, our Board of Directors has authorized a new common share purchase program of up to $5 billion with no set expiration date. To conclude, while 2023 was an eventful year, we finished strongly in 4Q, which creates an encouraging starting point for our businesses into 2024. This year, we remain highly focused on both the execution of our strategy and the accountability for results. Our goals are clear. We must continue the improvement in our sales performance that we demonstrated in the second half of 2023, continue to implement a set of productivity initiatives and product enhancements that will drive longer term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and deliver positive fee operating leverage in 2024, all while returning capital to our shareholders. We are laser focused on these goals. Now, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, let me briefly discuss the notable items we recognized in the quarter on Slide 5, which collectively totaled $620 million pretax or $1.49 of EPS. First, we recognized an FDIC special assessment of $387 million, which is reflected in other expenses. Second, we recognized $203 million of net repositioning charges to enable the next phase of our productivity program. As we had indicated in December, the bulk of this action primarily relates to severance of around 1,500 employees. Our initiative to streamline and delayer our operations, technology and staff functions and improve efficiency will allow us to sustainably reduce expenses. We expect these actions collectively to have a payback of roughly six quarters and begin this quarter with roughly two-thirds of the benefit occurring in 2024. These actions and the related savings will contribute to our fee operating leverage goal for 2024 and in subsequent years. Turning to Slide 6. I will begin my review of both our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. As you can see on the table, total fee revenue was flattish for all periods of comparison quarter-on-quarter, the year-on-year quarter and for the full year. The slight market appreciation, notwithstanding the combination of muted volatility, central bank pivot and geopolitical concerns, pushed investors to the sidelines for much of the year. In terms of our more durable revenues, we continue to benefit from strong momentum in our front office software and data business, which was up 5% on a full year basis and 13% on the year-on-year quarter. In terms of areas that have begun to rebound, management fee performance was down for the full year at minus 3%, but has begun to rebound with an up 5% result for the year-on-year quarter as flows picked up and we gained share. Back office servicing fees was challenged for much of the year as the client's transactional activity was muted but has started to turn positive and is up 1% this quarter as we've seen a recent lift in equity markets. And of course, we continue to be affected by industry wide headwinds in our global markets businesses, given the low levels of volatility in the FX markets and specials activity in agency lending throughout the year. NII has been tough to predict and surprise to the part of this quarter compared to third quarter. I'll turn to that in a few minutes. Expenses were well controlled in the quarter as we continue to thoughtfully allocate resources across the franchise and to areas where we see the greatest opportunities for top line growth. Relative to the year ago, total expenses ex-notables were up 2% year-on-year and reflect intensifying cost management in a tough environment as the year progressed. This expense control, coupled with the repositioning actions I just mentioned, prepare us to deliver productivity savings and positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Finally, despite a dynamic and challenging operating environment, we delivered full year 2023 EPS growth of 3% excluding notable items. This was supported by share repurchases, a record level of NII and the growth for our front office software and data business, which is less exposed to macroeconomic conditions. Turning now to Slide 7. We saw period end AUC/A increase by 14% on a year-on-year basis and 4% sequentially. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels and net new business. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels. At Global Advisors, period end AUM increased 19% year-on-year and was up 12% sequentially, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and strong net inflows. Notably, as Ron mentioned earlier and I'll describe momentarily, in fourth quarter, GA recorded the best ever quarter of aggregate net flows of $103 billion, which sets us up well for 2024. At the center right, we've also added a table of market volatility indices, which we believe can be useful indicators of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, specials activity in agency lending and flows in margins and FX trading. On Slide 8 now. On the left side of the page, you'll see fourth quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average equity markets, partially offset by pricing headwinds, lower client activity and adjustments and a previously disclosed client transition. Sequentially, total servicing fees were down 2%, primarily as a result of the pricing headwinds and a previously disclosed net client transition, partially offset by higher client activity and adjustments, which was nice to see as clients started to come off the sidelines. On the bottom left of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. We were quite pleased to see new servicing fee revenue wins of $103 million this quarter, the highest in many recent years, primarily reflecting the enhancements to our sales processes and product offerings, including in North America where we saw strong outcomes after a period of underperformance. These servicing wins contributed to the total full year fee revenue wins of $301 million and underscores the progress we're making towards stronger sales performance. Recall, our goal for 2024 is even higher at $350 million to $400 million in servicing fee sales for the year. Finally, we had $270 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $57 million year-on-year and $15 million quarter-on-quarter. We expect about half of this to install in 2024. We also had $2.3 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end. Turning to Slide 9. Fourth quarter management fees were $479 million, up 5% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average equity market levels and some performance fees, partially offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impact of a strategic product suite repricing initiative that has aided ETF flows. Relative to the third quarter, management fees were flat, mainly driven by higher performance fees, offset by a previously described shift of certain management fees into NII and the impacts of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiatives. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with very strong and broad based business momentum across each of its businesses. In ETF, we had record quarterly net inflows of $68 billion, driven by record net inflows into SPY as well as the SPDR portfolio US low cost suite experiencing consistent market share gains. In our institutional business, we saw quarterly net flows of $6 billion, primarily driven by defined contribution products. And lastly, across our cash franchise, we saw quarterly cash net inflows of $29 billion, primarily into money market funds, which contributed to the record total full year 2023 cash net inflows of $76 billion and institutional money market fund market share gains. Turning now to Slide 10. Fourth quarter FX trading services revenue was down 11% year-on-year ex-notables and 2% sequentially. Relative to the period a year ago, the decrease was mainly due to lower FX spreads from muted market volatility offset by slightly higher volumes. Quarter-on-quarter, the decrease primarily reflects lower direct FX revenues from muted volatility. Fourth quarter securities finance revenues were down 6% year-on-year due to lower agency balances, partially offset by higher agency spreads, higher specials activity and prime services revenue. Moving on to software and processing revenues. Fourth quarter fees were up 10% year-on-year and 26% sequentially, largely driven by CRD, which I'll turn to shortly. Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $15 million year-on-year, primarily due to a midyear tax credit investment accounting change, partially offset by the impact associated with the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. Moving to Slide 11. You'll see on the left panel that fourth quarter front office software and data revenue increased 13% year-on-year, primarily as a result of the continued SaaS implementations and conversion, driving software enabled and professional services revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was up 38%, primarily driven by higher on premise renewals and go live implementations. Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel. We\u2019re pleased to report four more Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, which means seven wins for the full year 2023. State Street Alpha continues to be an important differentiator of our business and creates an attractive value proposition for our clients with contractual terms usually covering five to seven, to 10 years. We\u2019ve also gone live with three more Alpha clients which brings us to six for the year, which sets us up well for 2024, and added significant new functionality for fixed income portfolio managers. Fourth quarter ARR increased 16% year-over-year, driven by 20 plus SaaS client implementations and conversions, and we had a record quarter for front office new bookings at $32 million. Turning to Slide 12. Fourth quarter NII increased 14% year-on-year but increased 9% sequentially to $678 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to lower average deposit balances and deposit mix shift, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Sequentially, the increase in NII performance was primarily driven by the impact of interest rates and the full quarter impact of the third quarter investment portfolio repositioning, as well as higher deposits and loan balances. The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, as both interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits increased and certain client repricings were further delayed. Some of the higher deposit balances may have been seasonal but the Fed's quantitative tightening appears to have been offset by the reduction of the Fed's Reverse repo operation, which seems to have resulted in clients leaving higher bank deposit balances. It's hard to know how deposits will trend but we are pleased with this higher step-off going into the first quarter of 2024. On the right side of the slide, we show our average balance sheet during fourth quarter. Average deposits increased 4% quarter-on-quarter with non-interest bearing deposits up 3% for the quarter. Turning to Slide 13. Fourth quarter expenses, excluding notable items, increased 2% year-on-year or 1% ex-FX. Sequentially, fourth quarter expenses were up only 1% as we actively managed expenses and continued our productivity and optimization savings efforts, all while carefully investing in strategic elements of the company, including Alpha, Private Markets, Core Custody and tech and ops process improvements and automation. On a line-by-line basis and year-over-year, ex-notables, compensation employee benefits increased 1%, primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by lower contractor spend and performance based incentive comp. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the benefits from ongoing optimization efforts in sourcing and vendor credits. Transaction processing increased 1%, mainly reflecting higher brokerage costs. Occupancy increased 24%, largely due to the absence of an episodic sale leaseback transaction in the prior period. And other expenses were up 3% sequentially, flat year-on-year, mainly reflecting higher marketing spend and professional fees. Lastly, let me spend a moment on headcount. As we discussed in the third quarter, as part of our ongoing transformation and productivity initiatives, we have streamlined our operating model in India and have now assumed full ownership of one of our operations joint ventures, and we recently announced that we intend a similar undertaking with a second consolidation in the country this spring. This consolidation continues the transformation of State Street's global operations and will enable us to unlock productivity savings, which we expect to start this quarter through a reduction in contractor services and in the years ahead as we simplify our fragmented operating model. As you would expect, consolidating the first joint venture increased our FTE headcount roughly 4,400 in the quarter as we in sourced global capabilities. However, these costs were already in our expense base and reported historically under the comp and benefits line. These actions are contributing to our higher productivity savings targets for 2024. Moving to Slide 14. On the left side of the slide, we show the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, we continue to navigate the operating environment with very strong capital levels, which came in above both our internal targets and our regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% was up 60 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by episodically lower RWA and improvement in AOCI, partially offset by the continuation of common share repurchases. The decrease in interest rates during December after the completion of our buyback contributed about 20 basis points to our CET1 ratios. And some market factors over the last week of December conveniently contributed roughly another 50 basis points to the RWA end of period print. Going forward, I would expect RWA to run at higher levels to support our various businesses. Our LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 106% and 122% for State Street Bank & Trust. In the quarter, we were quite pleased to return over $700 million to shareholders, consisting of $500 million of common share repurchases over $200 million in common stock dividends. Lastly, as we announced earlier today, our Board authorized a new multiyear common equity repurchase program of up to $5 billion with no expiration date. Turning to Slide 15. Before I start, let me first share some of the assumptions and underlying our current views for the full year. Let me cover our full year 2024 outlook, as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter, both of which have more potential for variability than usual given the macroeconomic environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro expectations, as we stand here today, we expect global equity markets to be flat point to point in 2024, which equates to the daily average being up about 10% year-over-year. Our interest rate outlook for 2024 largely aligns with the forward curve as of year end 2023, which I would note continues to move. We expect to see modest increase in FX and equity volatility, which should support slightly higher FX trading services fees this year, but we are still seeing muted volatility in the first quarter. And we expect currency translation to have less than 0.5 percentage point impact on revenues and expenses due to dollar depreciation. And I would remind you that a weaker US dollar has a favorable impact on revenues and an unfavorable impact on expenses. So we currently expect that full year total fee revenue will be up approximately 3% to 4% ex-notable items with servicing fee and management fee growth driven by higher market levels and continued business momentum and continued strong growth in front office software and data. This includes a headwind of a little less than 1 percentage point to fee growth from the expected previously disclosed client transition. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we currently expect fee revenue to be up 2% on a year-over-year basis with servicing fees expected to be up 1%, management fees up 7% to 8% and front office software and data expected to be up over 20%, largely due to increased SaaS new business and conversions and on-premise renewals. We expect full year 2024 NII to be down about 10% on a year-over-year basis compared to a record 2023. This is dependent on the outcome of global rate cuts and deposit mix and levels, which are obviously difficult to predict. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, after a significant step up in 4Q '23, we expect 1Q '24 NII to be flat to down 3% on a sequential quarter basis given current deposit mix expectations. Turning to expenses. As you can see on the walk on Page 16, we expect full year expenses ex-notables will be up about 2.5% on a nominal basis in 2023, driven largely by our continued investment in the business, which we expect to largely offset through greater productivity savings worth $0.5 billion, which is approximately 1.7 times last year's gross savings level. Regarding the first quarter of 2024, we expect expenses ex-notable items to be up 1% to 1.5% on a year-over-year basis, keeping in mind that seasonal expenses usually occur in the first quarter. As a reminder, we expect to achieve positive fee operating leverage, excluding notable items for full year 2024, given the projected growth in fee revenue and well controlled expenses. Finally, we expect taxes should be in the 21% to 22% range for 2024. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Alex Blostein : I was hoping we could start with unpacking some of the NII dynamics, and I guess appreciate the uncertainty when it comes to deposits. But Eric, maybe talk a little bit about what drove the upside in the fourth quarter in deposit levels, and if you have a view on what sort of seasonal versus more kind of core client franchise driven? And maybe give us some insight on where you expect balances to ultimately stabilize in the back half of the '24? Eric Aboaf : Let me share with you the texture we have. But I'll just say deposits and deposit levels continue to be volatile, they surprise to the upside. And in particular, we saw a nice uptick in deposits into September, October, we actually saw, on the NIB side, a downtick in November and then a large uptick again in December. So the averages came in up for the quarter, which made a big difference. $1 billion of NIB for a month is worth $5 million and you kind of multiply through and that quickly adds up as we had a spread in December of $5 billion, $6 billion relative to our expectations. And at the same time, we also saw interest bearing deposits up. Now some of that is just our regular way engagement with clients, some of that is there leaving more deposits with us. And I think you did see, in the Fed reports, the banking system deposits are up 1%, 2% quarter-on-quarter from third quarter to fourth quarter. So it does seem like there's something happening in the market that's creating a little more stability, a little bit of buoyancy. There's some amount of seasonality that we always tend to see at the end of the year as folks accumulate cash, sometimes to pay dividends and ETFs in the next year. So it's just hard to read but that's what played out. And it played out better through the quarter and through the end. If I then try to look forward, it's very hard to look forward for the year. And we'd like to operate and expect to operate in the deposit range of $200 billion to $210 billion, that's our kind of goal. A lot of that is just client engagement and helping put their cash to work. And sometimes they put cash to work in deposits, in repo, in money market sweeps. But there's a category -- each one of those is an important category and outlet for clients. And what we're seeing is clients using all the, I'll call it, all the above, right, including just holding treasury securities. So that we expect to continue and we think deposits will be roughly in this zone in the first quarter. What's a little harder to read is just how noninterest bearing deposits play out. We do expect those to continue to float downward. They tend to float downward for our clients with the largest funds, those are the ones that have been floating down over the last two years. So we continue to see that expectation. There continues to be a little bit of repricing that plays out into the first quarter too as well. And that's why I guided on an NII basis to flat to down 3% for the first quarter, just to give you a little bit of an indication, but we expect that to be roughly on flattish deposits. Alex Blostein : My follow-up, sticking with deposits is around just deposit beta as we start to sort of enter the rate cutting cycle. So hoping you could articulate maybe what you're assuming for deposit beta on the way down in your '24 NII guidance? And then broadly, how we should think about sort of the cadence of deposit betas as we progress through the rate cutting cycle into the back half '24, '25 maybe. But just curious to know kind of high at the upper -- at the beginning, lower towards the end or the opposite? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's an important topic, because it's how we interact with our clients, it's how we price our products, it's how the industry has operated in for many years. I think you know that our deposit betas on a cumulative basis have climbed quite a bit in the US. They're 75% or so cumulatively since the start of the cycle. In euros, it's around 60% cumulatively in pound sterling, closer to 30% to 35%. So they're clearly moved up. What certainly happens as, and I'll say when, if and when rates fall, is the deposits -- beta is reverse, there's some amount of symmetry. Now they reverse instantaneously, we want to be careful with our clients, we want to be fair. But we do think that over multiple quarters and certainly over any realistic time frame, the Fed cuts and there's got to be an adjustment. Now part of that happens because we have a good bit of our deposits that are indexed to market, they're indexed to market indicators. There are quite a few that are indexed with a spread and then there are a small amount now that has a transactional kind of, I'll call it, administered feature. But you'll generally see a broad amount of symmetry in deposits down versus up. I think what you do need to keep in mind is that our asset sensitivity and liability sensitivity, though, are somewhat different between international markets and in the US, right? In international markets, because those cumulative betas are still in the 30% to 60% range, we're still asset sensitive. So we make more money with increases in rates. And we actually -- NII will trim down with decreases in rates. And that's where we're most -- that's our interest rate sensitivity today. On the US, we have a slight positive bias towards being liability sensitive, but it's still relatively slight. I'd almost call it neutral. So part of what we're doing is just navigating this interest rate environment. It's not exactly clear when the rates come, it's not clear whether the US cuts before Europe or vice versa. And part of what we'll do is actively manage our portfolios to try to take advantage of what's coming. At the same time, we'll price our deposits fairly and prudently. Operator : You next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Brennan Hawken : I think maybe some of what you just said on the non-US side might explain this. But when we think about triangulating the minus 10% to the fact that 1Q is either going to be flat, it\u2019s only down a little on NII, it sort of suggests that your exit rate by the time you get to the 4Q '24 based on what you can see today, it's probably going to be rather low. Am I reading correctly in thinking that it's that non-US piece and that's going to drive some of that weakness? And am I extrapolating the comments correctly to think that we could see a little bit more back end weighted decline for NII? Eric Aboaf : I think you've got the right general pattern framed in the area of NII. Clearly, we have very strong step off in particular, in December, but in the fourth quarter, which will flow into first quarter, and then we expect a trending down. We had a couple of -- well, probably earlier last year, so a couple of quarters ago, I described an NII range of $550 million to $600 million. And we think we'll get into that range, the top end of that range by around the third quarter. But it's a little bit hard to know the exact shape. We just -- but you've got the right direction of travel. And then we expect some stabilization in the second half of next year, maybe around the top half, the middle half of that range, just really hard to tell exactly where and when. If you step back and ask, what are the underlying drivers? There are really three drivers that continue to be important. In terms of tailwinds, we continue to have long rates playing through the portfolio and the investment portfolio balances as they recoupon at higher rates, that's particularly important in the first half of the year, a little less so in the second half of the year, but that continues through as a positive. You then have, as you mentioned, short rates starting to come down. And because of our sensitivity position across the global markets, that does start to have a headwind impact on NII as those cuts continue to come through. Now we'll see what's the pattern and pace of US versus international cuts. And I think right now, we've pegged to the forward, which shows a lot of consistency in symmetry but we'll see if that really happens, because you can see inflation expectations keep moving around literally daily, weekly. And then the third feature is just client deposits and mix. And while we expect client deposits to be in that zone of $200 million, $210 million, they might bump up above that, a little below that, but they'll be in that broad zone. The mix will continue to shave down out of noninterest bearing over the next quarter or two, we think, it's hard to, again, to predict and then there's -- we're working through the final stages of some of our interest bearing deposit, repricing, those seem to have taken a little longer in some cases than we expected. That's okay, that means we accrete income. But those continue to come through and they'll still play through in the first quarter or two as well. And then that's what kind of brings us to some level of reasonable stability in the back half of the year. Brennan Hawken : And by the way, I apologize for background noise that is here. Second question, a bit more strategic. So we saw a flurry of Bitcoin ETF launches here recently. It didn't seem like you all actually landed any of those servicing opportunities. So I want to confirm whether my early read on that is right. And given the magnitude of the investment and the focus you've made on digital assets, what did you learn if you guys missed on that? And is that what led to the restructuring of the digital asset group, and what should we see as a change from that restructuring? Ron O'Hanley: So Brennan, there were 11 launched on the day that the -- or day after the SEC gave approval, and we actually service three of them. And I think we're the only ones that\u2019s servicing across three different digital custodians. So we helped three of the major players make this happen. So we're quite active in the space. And as you'd expect, we do everything for each of those three except for the actual custody for the reasons that I think you know. So no, we're very active in the space. It was -- what did we learn? I mean it's early. What I think everybody is watching out for is there's a lot of players that went into the market, some of them with some existing high levels of assets. What will be interesting to see over time is, does it actually consolidate and how does it work in terms of who the buyers are institutional versus retail versus intermediary, but these are early days. And it was good to get the uncertainty cleared up and for all this to get launched, and we're keen to be part of it. Brennan Hawken : Ron, thanks for clarifying pure custody versus the servicing, Very, very helpful. Ron O'Hanley: And just to clarify, I mean, I think everybody knows this. But I mean, right now, it's extremely difficult for a bank to do pure custody because of the capital requirements that are imposed on a bank. I mean it's basically 100% capital. So therefore, virtually everybody is working with some kind of digital custodian, a non-bank digital custodian, but all of the other parts of the ecosystem, which we're quite familiar with, we are participating in. Operator : Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So big flows in SSGA, which is great, good to see, these things are unpredictable, but I am curious on if you had any thoughts towards sustainability? And maybe it would be the color of what clients are buying, what clients are -- I mean, what flavors of ETF are they, the average fee? And what you're specifically doing differently on the distribution front and education front to get at those flows? Ron O'Hanley: So there are a number of things going on there in the fourth quarter, Glenn, and throughout 2023. I think as we've noted and certainly, you all would have observed, there was -- it was most of the year with some episodic exceptions, it was a risk-off environment that changed in fourth quarter somewhat as predicted once investors got a sense of where interest rates were going, as they did when the Fed communicated in the third quarter more or less a pause. I think that started activity going. So much of the activity late in the year would have been the kind of classic risk on, let's put positions on quickly, benefiting the highly liquid SPDR Core SPY in the sector ETFs. But underlying it and throughout the year, the low cost ETFs, which represent different investors, these would be -- the ultimate holders here tend to be individuals. They're often advised by an intermediary like an RIA, so they\u2019re -- it's very sticky. And we have continued to build share there, both in equity and fixed income, low cost. Across the board, fixed income is seeing a dramatic growth. I think there's increasing acceptance, both by retail investors and institutional investors that the ETF is a good vehicle to hold fixed income and you're just seeing that asset allocation moving that way. And then finally, active ETFs of all sort, you're seeing growth in. And it's been a long time coming. As you know, it's been over a decade on how is this actually going to play out. And it's ironic how it's playing out and that everybody is just taking their standard investment strategy and putting it in active ETF. We benefit from some of that on the GA side in terms of what they're doing in fixed income, but we benefit from it greatly on the servicing side, because we're very, very -- not to overuse the word, active in the active ETF servicing space. And we believe you'll see a lot more growth there as core funds and core offerings of well known asset managers either get converted to ETFs or launched as ETFs. So we're really pleased on the GA side. In terms of what drove it, I think it was the next part of your question. I mean, part of it was much more focused and resources dedicated to the various intermediary channels. I mean our roots are in the institutional channels, but the lots of the growth is in the intermediary channel. So that's part of it. And then as we talked about, I believe, last quarter, we took a hard look at pricing, particularly in the so called low cost ETFs and recognizing their durability, felt that it was worth the investment to reprice them to continue to gain market share because they tend to be very, very sticky. Glenn Schorr : I'll go quickly on the follow-up. It's the same question just different on the servicing front, happy with the wins you noted. Maybe we could just drill down. I know it's not huge yet, but the private markets piece of the servicing wins. I'm curious if you want to tell us how much it was, but more importantly, what it is and how -- is it one client or is it multiple clients? I'm curious on how that private market servicing space is developing? Ron O'Hanley: No, no, it's both. To answer the last part of it first, Glenn, it's certainly not one client. I mean, this is a space that we've invested in and we're well known in. And we see a secular trend here where it's -- so many of these operations are held inside firms are highly bespoke often sitting in very expensive locations. And as the product sets have become more complicated, I mean, it's following a path that the active long only industry followed 10, 15 years ago. It was fine to do all this stuff inside when it was just a couple of products that are fairly straightforward, that's not what's happening now, products are more complicated. As you start to think about the structures that enable high net worth individuals to participate in it, you've got that added complexity. And then oftentimes, there's side investments that are permitted, et cetera. So it's very complicated. It lends itself to outsourcing. It's still very much an in-sourced business. So we see lots of potential growth in it. Its fee characteristics are different, positive in the sense that the fees are higher, but also the fees get fully recognized when the fund is fully invested. So part that we pay a lot of attention to is what's the expected actual, one, money raised and then draw down and how do we do our best to match our expenses to that. But we're very excited about the business. Much of the new investment, product investments that Eric talked about in the 2024 guide includes further strengthening of our position there. There's innovation in there and our goal is to continue to set moats around us so we can continue to excel at it. Eric Aboaf : I'd just add privates has been a real strong area of growth for us. We've described it as up 10%, 15% in different quarters. So it's a big part of our growth agenda as we -- this past year. And then this coming year, as we take our sales, goals up, the $350 million to $400 million at least a quarter of that plus is going to be around private, and that's what's going to help us continue to drive privates growth. We think in the 15% plus range in terms of year-on-year revenues. So it's an area that I think we've actually broadly with both large and small and midsize, it's actually well distributed and it's got a good mix of US, Europe and Asia sales coming through as well. Ron O'Hanley: Yes, as well as, Glenn, it's not just private equity, it's private equity -- private credit is booming. And for every bank that complaints about what's going to happen with regulation and the fact that it's pushing activity out of the banking system that's going right into the private credit area, and we should be the beneficiary of that growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Eric, can you share with us -- I know you and Ron were in the State Street 10 years ago, but your comments about the net interest income outlook and just how volatile it is due to what's going on in the bond market with the Federal Reserve and their balance sheet. Are there any indicators you're monitoring that we could look at that might be able to give us a better insight to when net interest income for State Street might be more predictable on a go forward basis? Eric Aboaf : I take a sigh when I think about this question. I think the predictability is partly around Fed actions, right? This is the highest rate level that we've seen in 22 years. And also if I go back a couple of years, the lowest rate level we've probably seen in two decades as well, right? So we've kind of -- we're at these wide bookends relative to really since the -- I want to say, the turn of the century, right, and that's really created this volatility. Can we manage that and mitigate? Well, we do try to sustain on a regular basis, match off deposit, deposit tenor, rate characteristics with the asset side of the portfolio and we do that with duration. The challenge is if you take too little duration, you have even more volatility. If you have to take too much duration on the asset side of the portfolio, you've got more AOCI risk, and so our tools to stabilize work up to a point and then have some negative implications. So I don't really see a way to turn what we'd like to have -- I don't see a way to turn this into just a flywheel of metronome that moves at a certain pace, and it's just a feature of what we do. And part of it is our institutional deposits have somewhat more asset sensitivity or liability sensitivity to rates relative to a very simple regional bank. So we'll tend to have a little more, but that's part of the industry, I think we're in line with peers. Gerard Cassidy : Ron, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the success and the momentum you're having with the Alpha product in the servicing business -- in the Investment Services business, I should say. Is there any capacity constraints that you've got to be careful about if the momentum continues, or is it almost now when you got plenty of bandwidth to handle future growth? Ron O'Hanley: I would say that the capacity constraint has been particularly with these large complicated client, the really large ones, some of which are -- well, most of which are still being onboarded, the capacity strength has been around onboarding. Over past year, in particular, we've gotten better at that. You can -- if you just look at that number, we were roughly at about, as I recall, $3.6 trillion in assets to be onboarded and we're now down to $2.3 trillion. So you can see we're getting better at that. The real constraint to be specific about it tends to be and how quickly do you onboard the middle office element to that, because that often requires engineering and by that I mean, engineering with the client, because ultimately that's a client and it's like any other kind of industrial outsourcing. A client has an operation, those things in a particular way wants to outsource that element of it to us. We're not interested in taking somebody's mess for less. I mean, we need to actually work with them to engineer it in a way where as much of it as possible is standardized and that the customization is limited to the extensive user interfaces or how things are actually applied. And we've just gotten better at that over time. So I would say, looking forward, we don't see that as being a meaningful constraint. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Just maybe a follow-up on the -- outside of sort of the private markets, you've ramped up pretty quickly in terms of getting to your $400 million of new servicing fee wins. And maybe if private markets are a quarter, can we talk a little bit about the other three quarters, where you've seen success, what's worked, what hasn't worked and what kind of opportunity set do you see maybe even get above the $100 million? Ron O'Hanley: I mean, it's no one thing, but a lot of really important things across the board to ramp up our execution. Where we're seeing it, to answer the first part of your question, is the core Investment Managers segment still remains strong and active for us. And as some of those firms are facing the same kind of market that everybody else is, they're more interested in actually trying to do more with us and do different things with us, a little bit of a resurgence in the asset owner marketplace and in particular, amongst asset owners that aren't just pure asset allocators, meaning they're managing some assets themselves or truly actively asset allocating, doing not just listening to a consultant telling them what to do, but either managing money or at a strategic and tactical level, allocating assets, which again requires support. But in all cases, what we're doing is we're really focused on ensuring that the back office part of all this comes with it, and comes with it in a timely fashion, right? Because as I was saying earlier when I was talking to Gerard, the thing that takes a long time or a longer time to onboard would be the middle office, the outsourcing element of it. Onboarding back office is pretty easy, pretty straightforward. And it, in almost all instances, comes down in a pretty healthy incremental margin given the scale activities to it. And then finally, just to talk about regions. We have invested heavily in the capabilities in all of our regions where you see probably the most impact from that over the last couple of years, has been just the very good growth that we're seeing in Asia Pacific and really, all parts of Asia Pacific from Australia north to Japan and everything in between. The US, we've talked about in the past, we were not pleased with where we were in this past year, particularly the second half of the year. We're actually reasonably pleased with how we've done. Europe has always been strong to us. It was a little softer in 2023, but again, a very strong pipeline. But that regional focus where we're actually pushing accountability down into the country and regional level and making sure that it's very clear who is responsible for what, sharing, obviously, not just the technology and the product but the best practices in how you move these things forward, but very much decentralizing the accountability. Jim Mitchell : And maybe, Eric, just a quick one on the held maturity book still yielding just a little over 2%. Can you kind of walk us through the maturity profile of that, how long we start to see some pickup in -- or turnover and reinvestment benefits from that portfolio? Eric Aboaf : The way I\u2019d describe it is we've got a natural roll-off in that portfolio. It's about $5 billion a year. So it sort of plays out and that's related to the maturity in the latter, so that will come down over the next couple of years. As that happens, because as you say, it's at a lower coupon relative to our average, right? Our average portfolio yields are in the 3.5 range. There's real pickup that comes through that line. At least for the next couple of quarters, I guess, is probably for the next couple of years even, because once rates stabilize, we do think that we'll also get some steepness in the yield curve and that will help through. So there are some benefits coming that way. It's also a portfolio that obviously will insulate us from rate moves. I don't think in the next few years, this is the last down cycle versus up cycle then that we'll see and so it will serve its purpose then as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So Eric, I wanted to start off with a question just on the fee guidance, and benchmarking your historical fee performance versus the guidance. You've struggled to at least meet or exceed the guide in the absence of significant equity market gains. Can you guys hear me okay? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Steven Chubak : So you have a conservative market assumption embedded in the fee guide for the coming year. And just given that historical experience, I was hoping you could just provide additional granularity in terms of growth across the different fee lines that's underpinning that 3% to 4% growth assumption for this year? Eric Aboaf : Let me maybe describe it in a couple of ways, because 3% to 4% is for the overall franchise. We think that there are some areas of the franchise that will be higher and in some cases, a good bit higher than that. Asset Management, very geared towards the equity markets and the 10% tailwind in equity markets, comes through on literally half of that tends to the right through the asset management fee line, and then the flows that we talked about earlier in the call provide a nice tailwind. So we need to see how markets play through. But the combination of those two, which is exactly how the business is designed, it's market based and it's flow based, will be healthy. I think software and data processing, we've historically said high single digits, sometimes low double digits. If you look at the last couple of years, you're at the 9%, 10% average full year growth. And we've got good visibility there, part of that is Alpha and part of that is outright software and data sales, and so that's strong. I think at the other bookend, servicing fees will come in -- it will be a bit below the 3% to 4%, now some of that is core organic net new business that we need to drive, which is why we've reshaped and tuned that area, in particular on the sales and how we go to market. You're seeing some of the benefits there and how we measure ourselves. We're being very conscious there. But one of the reasons that one will be lower this coming year is that we had that previously announced transition coming through, which will mute some of what we'd like to see. And then the markets activities, we're hoping will be somewhere in the middle of the range, whether FX trading and sec finance. I think what plays out behind the market dependent areas and sometimes why we don't need is around client -- what we describe as client activity, how much transactional activity, whether our clients are on the sidelines or whether they're all in, that this past year on the servicing fees which are half of our fees, that was worth 2 to 3 percentage points of servicing fee headwind. I mean that literally. So you do the math, that's worth $100 million, $150 million of headwind because we don't have those -- that activity, the transactional activity in derivatives, in international custody, which is very, very valuable to us. So part of what plays through is these macroeconomic features, equity bond markets on one hand, you've got client, the kind of risk-on risk-off sentiment, I think, is important. You've got volatility levels in FX and agency lending. And so those we have to live through and navigate through, and sometimes those will come in more strongly and sometimes less. And then I think finally, the piece that we do need to deliver on, Steve, is the part that we can control, which is sales, it's retention. And we've been very clear about our goals and our targets very purposely, because that's where we think we need to hold ourselves particularly accountable and where you can hold us accountable. And there's a version of goals and targets in servicing, we spent a little extra time there. But if you go through our line of businesses, we've got similar kinds of goals area by area and that's on us to deliver, which will help power us through. But the cyclical elements will still come and go. Steven Chubak : Just one quick follow-up from me. What's the assumed timing for the large client transition? Just wanted to get a sense as to whether that's reflected in the 1Q servicing fee guide or you're expecting that later in the year? Eric Aboaf : Let me see how -- let me try to describe this to you in a couple of ways and to be helpful. At this point, on a quarterly run rate basis, and I say that very specifically, we're about halfway through the transition, including a piece that came out in the fourth quarter. So we're halfway through on a quarterly run rate basis. We also, though, have to think about it on a fiscal year-on-year basis. And the way I would describe it on a fiscal year-on-year basis, remember, we said this was worth about 2 percentage points of total fees, that's what we've disclosed in our Qs and Ks. About a quarter of that fiscally has come out through the end of '23, about half of it will come out through '24 and about another quarter in '25, so it just takes time to play through. And so we did include that headwind in the first quarter '24 versus first quarter '23 guide, and it is important to that guide. And so our guide includes that and you've got the net guide as a result. Operator : Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just a very quick follow-up. I know the call has gone on so long, Eric. I heard you talk about just the right level of deposits between 200 and 210 . Did you say that you expect the growth we saw in fourth quarter to reverse in 1Q as we think about why deposits shake out? Eric Aboaf : No, what I said is that we think we'll operate in the $200 billion to $210 billion range in the first quarter, second, through the year. We expect that to be where we land. I think in fourth quarter on average, right? Remember, we also, I think, talked a little bit about the months, we talked there's end of period data, which is very volatile. But on average, we ended up at, I think, around $207 billion for the quarter in 4Q. And so we think roughly flattish deposits into 1Q. It's just hard to tell, there's seasonality at year end, there tends to be a low point in February, and then you've got cash building for tax purposes into March. But I'd call it flattish in the scheme of things but with a range around that. Ebrahim Poonawala : And just a bigger picture question around NIB mix and NII. Do we need to get to a point where QT is short, the Fed is done with cutting rates before we see NII stabilize and maybe the deposit mix shift would stabilize as well? Like do we need to get to that point or can it happen sooner than that? Eric Aboaf : My instinct on this is NIB will begin to stabilize sometime in 2024, we think sometime in the by the middle of the year or third quarter. You've kind of, at that point, I'll call it, burn through the largest accounts, those are the ones that kind of on a -- since its peak are down 75% in NIB. The smallest accounts are down by about 25% since the peak and those were seeing stabilize more and more. So I think we'll see some stability in NIB because clients and funds and fund boards have made their decisions, especially the ones that have $1 million or $2 million in an account, some of them just don't want to deal with the tax reporting, and so you'll get to some stabilization. So we think that will kind of stabilize. I think the broader question on NII will then come with how, what -- well, and at that point, I think deposit betas kind of tend to stabilize as well. So I think at that point, in the second half of next year, the real question is what is the direction of interest rates on the front end. So very important question, which is what's going to -- where is the long end going to go? And where is the long end going to go in the US versus in the international markets. And that is particularly important to the banking sector because with some amount of steepness in the yield curve, and it's hard to remember when we've had steepness, it's been a while, some amount of steepness in the yield curve is quite accretive to NII, and you expect in a good economy to have some. And so that will be a feature. So there's a series of elements that will come through, and it's hard to I think, to, as a result, predict too precisely. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Kenny Morgan Stanley. Ryan Kenny : Just a follow-up on the capital side. So you had an 11.6% CET1 ratio that was a nice improvement sequentially, it looks like that was driven mostly by $6 billion of lower RWA. Can you just help us impact the RWA dynamics a bit, what drove the optimization? And then you also mentioned RWA could be higher this year to support various businesses. Does that mean that the optimization was just temporary? Eric Aboaf : Let me describe it in a couple of different ways. We're all -- every bank tries to manage RWA just because it's part of our capital requirements and returns. And we try to report it carefully and we do it fully to the rules, as you'd expect. What tends to create the volatility because it's a spot measure, it's a one day of the quarter, one out of 90-day measure is the market factors. So if you've got an FX, or in any of the trading businesses if you've got a forward book or even a vanilla derivative book, you've got counterparty exposures, you've got -- that are affected in particular by the currency pairs. And as those move around in the last week of the quarter, you might be in the money or out of the money in those positions and those directly because of how to standardize RWA mathematics were just goes right through RWA. So that could create a swing of $4 billion, $5 billion on the size of our RWAs. Our RWAs is about 100 -- we printed around $112 billion, about half of that is in the markets area. And so there's a good bit of variability, and that's literally what happens. And so sometimes it will end up low, sometimes it will end up high. If you look at Page 14 of the presentation matures, you'll see low point of $107 billion a year ago in RWA, you'll see a higher point of $118 billion last quarter and quite a bit of that is driven by just those market factors playing through into the calculations that we have. And then in addition to that, if you're on a loan book like we do, you'll have overdrafts, overdrafts take RWA as well. And so we also saw some amount of benefit there this quarter. I think the way I would describe the go-forward view is that we ended up particularly low this quarter. We said it could be $6 billion, $7 billion lower than expected. What would par be, maybe I'll describe it that way, going forward, it might be $118 billion, it might be $120 billion. But you've got to put plus $5 billion, minus $5 billion band around that. And so what we want to do is we want to gently continue to reinvest capital into our businesses, because these FX businesses now that we have, have good returns. We've managed them well, they've got 10%, 12% returns in many cases. The securities finance businesses typically are high single digit return businesses, but that's healthy and it's very connected to the servicing and the administrative fee business that we have and important to our clients. And so our view is that these are ways for us to solidify and expand and deepen our relationship with clients. And so we'll gently add RWA each year. How much do we add? We add a few billion dollars, $3 billion to $5 billion of more RWA each year perhaps. But there'll be some volatility around that. And that will be a part of the way we drive our organic growth. We're a high return bank, that's for sure. But we do want to put some of our capital to work for core organic growth reasons. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Brown with KBW. Mike Brown : I guess I noticed that you saw record cash net inflows in 2023. And you mentioned that you actually took share in the institutional money market space. As we head into a declining rate environment here, I guess what's your expectation about how these cash and money fund assets could trend from here? I guess, historically, institutional money markets, they can act quite differently than retail. So I guess, once the Fed begins to reduce rates here, what are you thinking about in terms of the path of the flows out of money funds, could you actually still see some money fund inflows from institutional investors? Ron O'Hanley: Mike, it's a good question and one we think about all the time. So part of way we've attracted more money market funds going back to one of my prior answers is we just have a broader client base, and that helps. We've gained market share, not just in terms of assets, but we've just attracted more clients. And once you have them, whether the balances go up or down, typically you have them. I think historically, what's happened in terms -- and you've got to look back in history now, because we haven't had this kind of a marketplace. But the really sophisticated holders of institutional money market funds tend to hang on, because the fund itself, depending on its duration, and there is a little bit of duration in it, actually lags. So it's usually the opposite -- when rates are rising, the very sophisticated holders are toggling in and out depending on whether they see opportunities to go direct. Just given the nature of our client base, we don't see a lot of that activity. So we expect to keep them and it really will be around where do their balances go and do they need it for some other reasons, or do they see more attractive investment opportunities. I would expect that we would see, if indeed, we see a continued risk on environment that itself will cause a little bit of reallocation of institutional money market funds, because saying that everybody -- what everybody is talking about that there's so much parked on the sidelines while a lot of it is parked here. But I would go back to where I began the answer, which is it really is about establishing more client relationships, servicing them very well and then continue to grow the number of clients based on that track record. Mike Brown : The $5 billion share buyback authorization that certainly was a big number. Eric, as you just alluded to in the last question, there's a lot of puts and takes to consider on the capital front in 2024 and into 2025. I guess my question is really just why come with such a large authorization? You're targeting 100% payout ratio. So this would seem to me that you certainly would not need all of that in 2024. is this just a desire to have kind of a big authorization in place for a multiyear horizon or just to have more flexibility over time, just love to hear a little bit more about that? Eric Aboaf : The background here is that the industry has evolved, I would say, pre-CCAR, which is a long time ago, there used to be open ended authorizations in the banking sector. Once we got into CCAR, remember, there was a very defined annual amount of buybacks that you had to submit. In fact, you had to submit the first year and the second year and there was a lot of -- making sure that what you submitted within the Fed CCAR process was actually what you did, because wanted to keep consistency with that. And so the industry moved towards quite a bit of disclosure on a one year basis as a result. And if you recall, a lot of those one year disclosures happened right after CCAR was announced at the -- either at the end of June or in the second quarter earnings in July. What we've seen as we've scanned at least the banking, our peer banks, the G-SIBs, the large US regionals is now that CCAR is -- it's still an annual process, but it's really with the SCB and some of the refinements to it, it's really an ongoing process. And what we've realized is that I'd say more than three quarters of our peers, you probably know, have actually moved to open ended programs over the last year, year and a half. And so we just wanted to conform to that. As a result, this one is multiyear, it's open ended and we'll take it from there. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Well, no good deed goes unpunished $5 billion buyback to that last question. But are you assuming that Basel III gets modified? And if Basel III didn't exist, how much higher would that $5 billion number be? And at what price do you say buybacks don't make so much sense anymore? Ron O'Hanley: Mike, maybe I'll start on the Basel III. I think where Basel III comes out is very uncertain at this point. The comment period ended January 16th. I don't know how many millions of pages were submitted, but there's a lot to be evaluated there. And you all know the various pressure and response that the regulators are getting on this. So it's very hard to tell. I don't know that we would have changed the authorization if we had perfect clarity on where it was coming out, it was a factor, but it's not like we have -- we think it's absolutely going to be this and therefore. So I hope that helps. Mike Mayo : So where your base case, what is the RWA inflation, the most recent updates, we've gotten a few changes here during earnings season due to Basel III? Eric Aboaf : Mike, let me describe it this way. The headline that we've previously disclosed for the ANPR as it's written is Basel RWA increase for us at about 15%. So that's what we've shared. I think what we said at the time and we actually believe even more so now is that it will come in at a portion of that. There's been lots of discussion around, for example, energy tax credits, some of the arcane parts of Basel and how that impacts public policy mortgages, which were not really affected on. There's much more discussion about operational risk literally over the last few months and that would make us quite optimistic that the increases would be relatively small. So we've not updated it because it's just there's a menu out there, but we're encouraged. We think the regulators are trying to navigate public policy on one hand and the right level of capital in the banking system. But we think that the direction of the discussions, in particular, over the last few months are constructive. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Brian Bedell : Most of the questions have been asked and answered. Just one quick one on securities portfolio repositioning. I guess, Eric, what's the desire to potentially do more of those and potentially take losses and look at the sort of the capital usage for doing that and enhancing NII and NIM more versus share buybacks? Eric Aboaf : It's something that we continue to think about. I think every bank continues to think about, we included. We're just continuing to just work through how do we feel about the rate levels that we're at, in particular up on the curve. We are conscious of that, both in the US and in the international areas. We've got positions in pounds sterling and euros and so forth. So we'll just continue to evaluate it. I think as you indicated from your question, part of the reason we repositioned last year in the third quarter was around rate position. We thought it was a very good entry point. In retrospect, we timed that quite well. So we were quite pleased. And I think we felt like we came out ahead economically with the trade because we remember, we took out some bonds but also reinvested both in the belly of the curve and overnight. So that was constructive. And we'll also keep an eye on -- we don't have a lot of capital intensive securities, we've always had a very vanilla book. So there's not an enormous capital motivation, but we'll selectively look at it and see if it might make sense. But I think we're like many others, it's one of the things we keep an eye on. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Wildhack with Autonomous Research. Rob Wildhack : I wanted to ask about the fee operating leverage target for this year. Hypothetically, let's say, fees come in better than you expect. Would you anticipate dropping that down to the bottom line or reinvesting it? And maybe the same question in reverse, fees come in lower than expected. What kind of room is there on the expense side to preserve your fee operating leverage target? Ron O'Hanley: Rob, why don't I start on that. We feel like we've done a very good job this year in terms of -- in 2023, focusing on BAU cost reduction to help finance and create a very sizable investment pool. Eric walked you through that. So obviously, if fees are up dramatically more than expected, there are some revenue related expenses. But I wouldn't foresee -- I think we've got a lot to invest and execute against and I really won't want to get through that. On the margin, there might be a few things that we would do, but the vast majority of it will go to the bottom line. the case of the -- if the opposite occurs, whatever, a terrible market, geopolitical issues, flare and you've just got a very different environment than any one of us anticipate. Again, we'd probably -- you'd see some revenue related expenses come down naturally, which would help. I think at least my initial instinct would be to try and preserve the investments and look at is there any more to do on BAU, but then obviously, some of these -- we've got a pecking order for our investments in terms of priorities. And if it came to that, we\u2019d defer them. Eric Aboaf : I would just add that we've got a pretty industrial productivity plan for this year. Part of that was the repositioning that we announced, but two thirds of the roles impacted are really around delayering and simplifying State Street. We're actually taking our spans of control in some areas like operations from 5 :1 to 8 :1. We're taking standard controls in the business and staff functions in some cases from 3 :1 to 5 :1. And the benefit of that is it actually brings our teams, our client teams and operational teams even closer to our clients. And some of what we're doing with the joint venture consolidation is a catalyst for that because, in some cases, we had too many hand offs and now we can simplify processes and again, bring them closer to our clients. So there's some real structural changes there. And what we do want to do is make sure we see those through. As Ron mentioned, there's always a little more, we'll look at on the margin but we want to be careful. We want to do this right. But on the margin, you continue to work on vendors and so forth, you look at performance based incentive compensation, there are always other smaller levers. But we're pretty -- I think we've got a nice work set out and a lot to do. And I think we've got real confidence that this is, I think, year probably five. I don't think we name our programs with annual versions. But this is probably a year five of productivity program and should really deliver quite a bit. Rob Wildhack : And then on the regulatory front, there was some commentary last week from the FDIC around regulations for large index fund providers. I'm curious if you have any thoughts there on how that can potentially impact your business? Ron O'Hanley: From the FDIC, I didn't see this, Rob. Curious as to the FDIC's role in index funds. I wonder what Vanguard has to say about that. So I'm just not familiar with it, Rob. Rob Wildhack : I can send it over to you later. Eric Aboaf : Why don't we follow up off-line, Rob, just send it through to Ilene and the team. Ron O'Hanley: Yes, it could be, Rob, that GA is already on this. I just haven't seen that. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Please proceed. Ron O'Hanley: Well, thank you everybody for joining the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Ilene, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we released our first quarter financial results. We had a strong start to the year with our results demonstrating the breadth of our client franchise, the efficacy of our strategy, and our focus on execution. We reported both fee and total revenue growth, all while continuing to invest meaningfully in our business and controlling underlying expenses. Excluding notable items, we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as solid EPS growth in Q1 relative to the year ago period. The first quarter was an important milestone. We have detailed our strategic priorities for 2024, including the growth initiatives we are undertaking across each of our business areas, as we continue to both invest in our capabilities and also target further productivity gains. Guided by our purpose to help create better outcomes for the world's investors and the people they serve, our four strategic priorities are aimed at continuing to extend our competitive advantage, while delivering positive fee operating leverage excluding notable items in 2024. These 2024 priorities are : growing fee revenue; extending our leadership in our markets and financing and global advisors franchises; enhancing and optimizing our operating model; and continuing to differentiate our business through innovative client solutions and technology-led capabilities to support business growth. We remain intensely focused on executing against these strategic priorities, particularly in a dynamic operating environment in which financial market expectations continue to change significantly. For example, as inflation remains elevated and economic data continued to be robust, investors pushed back their expectation for the timing of Central Bank rate cuts and treasury yields increased during the first quarter. Despite this, global equity markets performed strongly and volatility remained muted, with many indices setting records as fears of a hard economic landing receded and optimism surrounding the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence continued in Q1. Turning to slide three of our investor presentation, I will review our first quarter highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, 2024 started strongly. Year-over-year, we produced both positive fee and total operating leverage, as well as good EPS growth, excluding notable items. First quarter EPS was $1.37 or $1.69, excluding a notable item related to the increase to the FDIC special assessments. Underlying year-over-year EPS growth was supported by total fee revenue growth and continued common share repurchases, which more than offset the impact of lower NII on total revenue. Underlying expenses continued to be well controlled, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts, with first quarter expenses increasing just 1% year-over-year, excluding notable items, even as we have increased the level of investments in our business. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see on the middle of the slide, we continue to make progress across our client franchise in generating better fee revenue growth. Within asset services, AUC/A increased to a record $43.9 trillion. We generated asset servicing AUC/A wins of $474 billion in Q1, supported by key wins in both North America and Europe. Servicing fee revenue wins totaled $67 million. After hitting our full-year sales target of $300 million in 2023, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales go of $350 million to $400 million in 2024. Our priority to grow fee revenue this year is underpinned by a strategy of leading with service excellence and driving stronger back office sales, differentiating with our State Street Alpha and private markets platforms. Our two new Alpha mandate wins this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute on the strategy, while also showcasing the clear competitive advantage and differentiation that Alpha creates for our business. For example, both Alpha mandate wins this quarter include back office services, which can install quickly, allowing us to realize revenue faster. Further, one mandate is our second Alpha for private markets win, a key growth area for us. Encouragingly, both of these Alpha wins were takeaways from a key competitor, with one of the wins having no existing services with State Street prior to becoming an Alpha client, and the other a shared client that will now consolidate back office with State Street. Within markets and financing, even as low FX volatility created a headwind for the industry in the first quarter, we attracted higher FX client volumes, both sequentially and year-over-year, supported by our market-leading and wide-ranging FX trading solutions. In FX, we were pleased to see higher client volumes in the 8% Q-over-Q fee revenue growth. We also expanded our markets franchise. Within outsourced trading, we continue to expand our product capabilities in geographical reach completing the acquisition of CF Global Trading in Q1. Global Advisors perform well, buoyed by higher equity markets, the strategic actions we have taken to position our asset management business for growth, and the benefits of the strong finish in step-off point at year-end 2023. 1Q 2024 management fees of $510 million are the highest since the first quarter of 2022. While GA experienced total aggregate outflows in Q1, this was driven by the impact of a large, but expected single client redemption within the institutional business. We saw continued momentum in the defined contribution business driven by our target day franchise. Encouragingly, we saw cash net inflows of $9 billion in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net inflows of our cash business. ETF AUM reached a record $1.4 trillion at quarter end with GA continuing to gather net inflows and expand market share within U.S. low-cost ETFs. Now let me spend a moment on our continuing productivity efforts. We have a detailed set of initiatives across our business aimed at creating cost efficiencies and lasting productivity improvements. Regarding our ongoing operating model transformation, which forms an important part of these productivity initiatives. As you know, we are streamlining our operating model in India, and last quarter we consolidated our first operations joint venture in the country. I am pleased to note that the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1. Combined, these two consolidations will propel the continued end-to-end transformation of our global operations and enable State Street to unlock productivity savings in the years ahead as we simplify our operating model. Before I conclude my opening remarks, I would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength. Total capital return amounted to $308 million in the first quarter, consisting of common share dividends and share repurchases. I would highlight that we have returned a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders in recent quarters, with total capital return over the last six quarters equivalent to almost 30% of State Street's total market cap at quarter end. As we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return this year, as we have outlined previously, it remains our intention to return approximately 100% of earnings in 2024 in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, we have delivered a strong start to the year as demonstrated by both sequential and year-over-year total fee revenue growth, encouraging business wins, strong underlying expense discipline, and continued capital return. As we look ahead, we remain highly focused on the execution of a set of clear strategic priorities for 2024. These strategic priorities are backed by detailed action plans aimed at driving growth across each of our business areas. Underpinning this execution is a set of business investments paired with a comprehensive set of productivity initiatives aimed at driving longer-term improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and generating positive fee operating leverage in 2024. Now let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide four, I'll begin my review of our first quarter financial results, which included a $0.32 EPS impact from an additional FDIC special assessment, as described within the notable items table on the right of the slide. As Ron noted, we produced a strong start to the year. On the left panel, you can see that total fee revenue was up both sequentially and year-on-year. Relative to the year-ago period, we delivered robust management fee growth, higher front office software and data revenue, and servicing fee growth, while underlying expenses were well controlled. As I mentioned during the first quarter, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $27 million, largely due to two CRE names. All told, we generated both positive total and fee operating leverage relative to the year ago, excluding notable items. We also delivered solid year-on-year EPS growth of 11%, excluding notable items, which was supported by the continuation of our share buybacks in the first quarter. Turning now to slide five. We saw period end AUC/A increase by 17% on a year-on-year basis and 5% sequentially to a record level. Year-on-year, the increase in AUC/A was largely driven by higher period end market levels, net new business and client flows. I would note that we have seen a mixed shift into cash and cash equivalents with an estimated 1 to 2 percentage points of total AUC/A versus a year ago. Quarter-on-quarter, AUC/A increased primarily due to higher period end market levels and client flows. As global advisors, period and AUM also increased to a record level, up 20% year-on-year, largely reflecting higher period end market levels and net inflows, and up 5% sequentially, primarily due to higher period end market levels. At the right center of the slide, the market volatility indices provide a useful indicator of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees, spreads in FX trading, and specials activity in agency lending. Turning to slide six, on the left side of the page, you'll see first quarter total servicing fees up 1% year-on-year, primarily from higher average market levels, partially offset by pricing headwinds, a previously disclosed client transition, and lower client activity and adjustments, including changes in certain client asset mix into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. In addition, the pace of installation started slower than we expected in the first quarter. Let me dimension some of these items for you. As I've told you before, the impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth. In addition, lower client activity and adjustments, including the client asset mix shift to cash, was also a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth this quarter, some of which we believe is cyclical. Sequentially, total servicing fees were up 1%, primarily as a result of higher average market levels, partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments, including the changes to certain asset mix and pricing headwinds. On the bottom of the slide, we summarize some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business. In the first quarter, we generated $67 million of servicing fee wins, nicely spread across both North America and Europe. As you recall, solid sales in North America like this was one of the goals that we had described at a conference last fall. In addition, we had $291 million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end, up $71 million year-on-year, and $21 million quarter on quarter. We also had $2.6 trillion of AUC/A to be installed at period end. Turning now to slide seven, first quarter management fees were up 12% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels and net inflows from the prior periods, partially offset by the impacts of the strategic ETF product suite repricing initiative. Related to the prior quarter, management fees were up 6%, due to similar reasons, partially offset by lower performance fees. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, following record inflows in 4Q \u201823, our investment management franchise remains well positioned with momentum across each of its businesses. In ETFs, the overall flows were relatively flat in first quarter. Our spider portfolio, U.S., low-cost suite achieved continued market share gains driven by net inflows of $13 billion. In our institutional business, we saw first quarter net outflows of $19 billion, primarily driven by a single client. That said, we saw continued momentum in the U.S.-defined contribution area with record AUM of approximately $730 billion. Lastly, in our cash franchise, we saw first quarter net inflows of $9 billion, the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net flows into cash. Turning now to slide eight, first quarter FX trading services revenue was down 3% year-on-year, but up 8% sequentially. Relative to the year ago period, the decrease was mainly due to lower spreads associated with subdued FX volatility, partially offset by higher volumes as client engagement increased across nearly all of our FX venues. Quarter-on-quarter, the 8% revenue increase primarily reflects higher volumes with particular strength in our EM business, as well as higher direct FX spreads. First quarter securities' finance revenues were down 12% year-on-year, mainly due to lower agency balances and lower spreads, primarily associated with significantly lower industry specials activity. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, we have seen agency lending balances up as demand is rising. Software and processing fees were up 25% year-on-year in Q1, largely driven by higher revenues associated with CRD, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Quarter-on-quarter, software and processing fees declined 13%, primarily due to our lower on-premise renewals, partially offset by higher lending-related fees. Finally, other fee revenue for the quarter increased $5 million year-on-year. Sequentially, other fee revenue increased $17 million, largely driven by an episodic currency devaluation in the prior quarter, which did not occur. Moving to slide nine, you'll see on the left panel that first quarter, front office software and data revenue increased 32% year-on-year, primarily as a result of continued SAS implementations and conversions, driving higher professional services and software enabled revenue growth. Sequentially, front office software and data revenue was down 20%, primarily driven by lower on-premise renewals and installations. Turning to some of the Alpha business metrics on the right panel, we were pleased to report two additional Alpha wins, including our second Alpha for Private Markets mandate. In addition three mandates went live in the first quarter, bringing the total number of live mandates to 21. First quarter ARR increased 19% year-on-year, driven by over 20 SAS client implementations and conversions over the last year. Turning to slide 10, first quarter NII decreased 7% year-on-year, but increased 6% sequentially to $716 million. The year-on-year decrease was largely due to deposit mix shift and lower average non-interest bearing deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of higher average interest rates, client lending growth, and investment portfolio positions. We were pleased to report a sequential increase in NII, which was primarily driven by higher investment securities yields, an increase in average interest-bearing deposits, and loan growth, partially offset by the decline in average non-interest-bearing deposits. The NII results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected, primarily driven by strength in both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposit balances towards the end of the quarter. While it is difficult to forecast the path of deposits in the current environment, we're pleased with the success that we are having in engaging our clients. On the right of this slide, we provide highlights from our average balance sheet during the first quarter. Average deposits increased 4% year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter, mainly driven by client-balanced growth across the interest-bearing deposit stack, partially offset by a reduction in non-interest-bearing deposits. Average non-interest-bearing deposits decreased by less than $3 billion quarter-on-quarter. Cumulative U.S. dollar client deposit betas were 80% since the start of the current rate cycle with cumulative foreign currency betas for the same period continuing to be lower in the 30% to 60% range depending on currency. Turning to slide 11, first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased barely 1% year-on-year as we both invested more to fuel fee growth and increased the size for our productivity and optimization savings efforts by more than 50%. On a line-by-line basis, excluding notable items, on a year-on-year basis, compensation employee benefits decreased 3%, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation and salaries, as well as a decline in contractor spend that was partially driven by the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in India. Information systems and communications expenses increased 4%, mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments, partially offset by the optimization savings and vendor savings initiatives. Transaction processing increased 4%, mainly reflecting higher broker fees due to increased global market volumes. Occupancy increased 10%, partially due to the real estate costs associated with the consolidation of the joint venture in India, which used to form part of the contractor cost within compensation and benefits, partially offset by footprint optimization. And other expenses increased 5% largely due to the timing of foundation funding. Lastly, I'll spend a moment on our transformation efforts. If you recall, consolidating the first operations joint venture last October increased our FTE headcount as we insourced those capabilities. However, it also came with an expected financial benefit excluding integration costs of $20 million over the course of the year. As Ron mentioned, the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in India closed on April 1. And this will also come with an increase in additional headcount from 2Q, as well as expected financial benefits. The consolidation of these two joint ventures will be a catalyst for the next phase of State Street's global operations transformation and enable us to create a second wave of service improvements and productivity savings next year. Moving to slide 12. On the left side of the slide, we detail the evolution of our CET1 and Tier 1 leverage ratios, followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide. As you can see, our capital levels remain well above the regulatory minimums. While we continue to focus on optimizing our capital stack, the strength of our capital position enables us to extend our balance sheet to support our clients. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.1% was down approximately 50 basis points quarter-on-quarter, largely driven by the expected normalization of RWA. The LCR for State Street Corporation was a healthy 107% and 130% of State Street Bank and Trust. Our exceptionally strong liquidity metrics benefit from the deep and diversified nature of our funding base and active balance sheet management. In the quarter, we were pleased to return $308 million to shareholders, consisting of $100 million of common share repurchases and $208 million in declared common stock dividends. As Ron noted, we continue to expect to return around 100% of earnings to shareholders this year. In summary, we're quite pleased with the quarter. We have a clear strategy for growth, a detailed set of priorities that we are executing against in order to drive continued positive both business momentum and expect to deliver increased fee operating leverage this year, excluding notable items. Finally, let me cover our full-year and second quarter outlook, which I would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the macro environment we're operating in. In terms of our current assumptions, as we stand here today, we're assuming global equity markets flat to first quarter end for the remainder of the year, which implies daily averages up 5% quarter-on-quarter in 2Q and up around 17% for the full-year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve, which I would note continues to move while we expect FX market volatility will remain muted. Given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels, we think total fee revenue for the full-year will now be at the higher end of our prior guide of up 3% to 4% year-on-year, so up a solid 4%, which is better than our previous outlook. There are, however, episodic and industry headwinds impacting our servicing business this year, including a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of client activity and adjustments, which includes the client asset makeshift into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. We believe some of these factors are cyclical in nature, and we expect to offset a portion with higher sales and additional management actions this year. Turning to NII as a result of our first quarter outperformance, strong deposit growth and the improved interest rate outlook, we now expect full-year NII will be down approximately 5% year-on-year, which is better than our previous guide of down approximately 11%. On expenses, we expect full-year expenses, ex-notables, will be roughly in line with our prior guide of up about 2.5%, but with the potential for some additional revenue-related costs this year. Given our improved outlook, we now expect to deliver additional positive fee operating leverage for the full-year, excluding notable items. Finally, turning to 2Q on a quarter-on-quarter basis and excluding notable items, we would expect total fee revenue to be up 1.5% to 2%, NII to be down 2% to down 5% and expenses up about 2% to 2.5%, excluding the seasonal compensation expenses in 1Q and notable items. We think the provisions for credit losses could be in the $15 million to $25 million range in 2Q, and we would expect to have a better view on that later in the quarter as we continue to monitor our portfolio. Lastly, we expect 2Q tax rate to be approximately 22%. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Brennan Hawken at UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Eric, your updated guide sort of suggests that NII, you guys expect to pull back a little bit here from this strong result here in the first quarter. But one of the things that I noticed was repo was particularly robust in the quarter. Could you give a little color around what drove that strength and how sustainable it is? And is some of that normalization embedded in your outlook? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. You know, there are a number of factors that drove the upswing in NII into the first quarter. The bulk of that was actually deposit balances coming in stronger than we had expected, both on the interest-bearing side across the stack and non-interest-bearing as well. That made up for the $30 million uptick in the -- in terms of our results relative to our expectation. The repo balances did tick up as well. They were a small part, but worth in NII terms, about a percentage point of more NII than we had expected. And I think what we're seeing is that as the conditions in the economy continue to evolve, clients are holding more cash on their balance sheets, or then putting that into a variety of different instruments. Sometimes it's on deposits, sometimes it's on sweeps, and sometimes it's in repo. And that's also been, in particular on the repo side, been aided a bit by the reduction in the feds overnight repo operation. So it's really a mix of factors that we're seeing, which together though are driving a better NII performance, which we're pleased with. Brennan Hawken : Yes, great. Thank you. You also quantified the impact of the BlackRock transition. So thanks for that. It does seem as though maybe that impact is a little larger than your prior expectation. Do I have the right read on that? And maybe could you give us an update on where we stand as far as the ongoing impact goes? Eric Aboaf : Sure, Brennan, it's Eric again. The previously announced client transition that we had referenced is in line in terms of amounts that we had expected. If you recall, we had said it would be worth about 2 percentage points of servicing fees this year, which is about a percentage point of total fees. And remember, if you go back to our original disclosure over the last couple of years, we had described the total amount to be worth about 2 percentage points of total fees. And we're seeing about half of that come through on a year-on-year basis this quarter and for this year. And so, you know, fully in line with what we had previously described. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. One quick follow-up on the NII stuff, and thank you for all the details. The balance is coming in, in March. I know these things are really hard to predict, but is something happening with the client discussions and the overall profitability management that might give you confidence that those balances stick? Or should we think of this as rates are higher, parking balances with a safe custodian? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, we've been heavily engaged with our clients over the last year, I'd say, year and a half, as we've seen, you know, quite a shift in the industry environment and, you know, the evolution of deposits in the banking system. I'd answer your question in a -- at a couple different levels. I think first, going into this year, we had expected total client deposit balances in the $200 billion to $210 billion. And we now see that in the $210 billion to $220 billion for this quarter, And to be honest, we expect that we continue at around that level. And a lot of that is both the engagement that we've had with clients. They all have cash and we certainly encourage them to bring it to us. And part of that is the way we think about client relationships, client profitability, the client services that we can offer. And so I think some of what you're seeing here in the higher aggregate levels of deposits is due to our management action. You know, I think in addition to that, there do tend to be somewhat higher deposits in the banking system. So the tide has been gently rising, I'd say very gently, and that's been helpful. And we expect that to be relatively neutral going forward, but we'll obviously need to see based on the actions, the various actions at the Fed and how they evolve. Glenn Schorr : Very cool. Appreciate that. One quickie, you can't comment on the specifics, but I'm more talking the big picture. You were named in some stories potential interest in some private credit manager. I'm more talking big picture of where theoretically that might fit in and just I like the better flows on CNS, SSGA, but strategically what are you focused on in terms of continuing growth across that franchise? Ron O'Hanley: Yes, Glenn, It's Ron. So we've tried to be quite clear above what we're doing over at SSGA. I mean, first is around continuing to grow the ETF franchise. As you know, our legacy strength is in the institutional business, where we continue to be quite strong, and we've focused a lot over the last several years on growing the low-cost ETF franchise, which tends to find its way into retail portfolios through intermediaries. That led to the repricing initiative that we did last year, which in retrospect is proven to be quite a smart move because the market share has gone up and those portfolios tend not to move, these are buy and hold investors. So ETFs would be one and then we continue to grow the active space, typically with working with very close partners of ours, and we see a lot of runway inactive. And then finally, fixed income, particularly out, we have a strong fixed income offering here in the U.S., and we've built it out quite a bit in the last couple of years in Europe, and you're seeing lots of strength in the ETF ecosystem in Europe. Second area of growth is really trying to leverage the institutional client base, because its legacy is the passive index business. If we have an institutional relationship, we tend to be the number one or number two manager on their platform. That leads you, that gives you a seat at the table and we believe it gives us an ability to potentially distribute other, kinds of, products and services. So that's where a lot of our focus is now on the institutional business. And then finally, continuing to deepen. We have a global franchise, but there's areas that we can deepen it more. You've heard us talk about Europe, and we're focused just as much on Asia Pacific as those markets continue to grow, and we're able to leverage the positions we have, but really focusing on deepening as opposed to broadening geographic reach. So that in a nutshell is how we're thinking about it, and we're pleased with how it's playing out. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that, Ron. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Please go ahead. Please go ahead, Ken, your line is open. Could you please unmute? No response. Moving on to Alex Blostein at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks. Another one for NII, I guess good quarter, good guide for the second quarter as well and that's sort of elevating your full-year NII guidance also. But similarly, I guess to kind of what we saw in your guidance last quarter, the back half of the year seems to have a pretty meaningful drop off for the tune of maybe $100 million bucks or so versus the quarterly run rate. Eric, I guess given your comments on deposits being stable and higher rates are kind of are where they are, you still get in the benefit of repricing on the securities portfolio? What sort of informs this sort of decline in NII towards the back of the year? Eric Aboaf : Alex, it's Eric. You know, we're going to continue to see some of the trends that we have been seeing, and it's just a matter of how the various pieces, you know, partially or fully offset each other over time. You know, we're going to continue to see a tailwind from the level of rates, at least given the current forward curve, because that plays through the investment portfolio and gives us a tailwind, as does some continued growth in lending. The headwind that we've been navigating through, which I would describe comes in steps, and sometimes it's a step down, sometimes half a step back up, is around the deposit levels across the interest-bearing stack, where we're just seeing deposits, I think, at nice levels, to be honest, while we continue to see the grind down of non-interest bearing deposits. And we do expect another quarter of that non-interest bearing deposits to trend down and then to flatten out in the second-half of the year. I think, so you'll see those trends continue. I think you'll -- we'll see where we come out. But you know, if you take our guide together, we expect a modest step down into the second quarter, and then we see a leveling off in the third and fourth quarter of our NII. I think in the past we've talked about being in a range of $500 million to $600 million a quarter. We're now seeing and expect to be comfortably above the $600 million per quarter range. But it's those factors as headwinds and tailwinds that'll play through, that'll kind of dictate exactly where we come out. But I think as I said earlier, the level of client engagement that we've had in terms of putting deposits with us, putting deposits at different price points with us. Some of those are the core transactional deposits that need to support custody accounts, and some of those are the discretionary amount of deposits. It's been a real priority for the franchise and I think one that we've shown some good success in. And that's really creating, I think, this better expectation than we had earlier signaled at the beginning of the year, and one that we think will endure and then, you know, provide the stability and over time upside in NII in the coming years. Alex Blostein : Great. All right. I think, that's helpful. My second question is around expenses. You talked about how consolidation of the GV, I guess, that took place recently in April here, will create a new wave of optimization for next year, if I got that right? Can you just outline what that could mean in terms of incremental, either rejuvenating benefits or cost benefits, however you want to frame that, and what that means for maybe the overall kind of expense growth for the franchise? I know you're holding the line this year really well, but is there an opportunity to kind of continue that into 2025 as well? Thanks. Ron O'Hanley: Yes, Alex, it's Ron here. I think it's good to focus on what we said here because we've talked to you and your colleagues just about ongoing productivity improvement. We've been at it for years. And we do believe this unlocks a potential, not a potential, but a new wave of productivity growth. And why is that? Well, firstly, almost by definition, if you're taking these ventures on, you're eliminating the margin that was in it, that was in our expenses, that now comes out, right? So you've got that as a near immediate tailwind. But more importantly, and more important for the long-term, is that we can really complete and take advantage of true end-to-end process improvement and simplification. We had created through the JVs, which go back to the early days of our off-shoring journey. We created a lot of complication. Unintentionally, we created a lot of complication. This enables us to get at that. The work has already started. Our operations folks are spending a lot of time in India there. They've done some recent hiring and brought on some great leadership there. So if you think about the importance of India to our operations and, you know, the amount of work that passes through there, between this end-to-end simplification, this ability to eliminate checkers of checkers of checkers and all those kinds of things, we see an enormous amount of opportunity to improve. And then finally, as we continue our technology investment, a lot of that will be directed there. It'll be directed at some of the things that, you know, in the past you would have said, well, let's take advantage of labor arbitrage. And now the technology is at a cost level where we can simply eliminate the labor and not have, particularly for some of these repetitive kinds of tasks between machine learning and other kinds of AI that you can use to replace labor. And you end up then with a one -- a lower labor cost, but more importantly, you've got job content that's very attractive to people, and people want to make careers here as opposed to feeling like they're stuck in this dead-end repetitive task. So we are very optimistic about this. Alex Blostein : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just a confirmation on the guidance you gave, Eric, on the 2Q fee revenue up 1% to 2%, NII down 2% to 5%, expenses up 2% to 2.5%. Is that sequential for revenue and year-over-year for expenses? Eric Aboaf : No, it was sequential for every one of those as you look forward. So it was all on a 1Q to 2Q basis. Brian Bedell : 2Q basis, okay. So then going back to the NII guide, I think you also said down 2% to 5% versus the 7% to 16% in 2Q and then did you say down again in 3Q and then flattening out or flattening out in 3Q? Eric Aboaf : What I described is a flatter second-half of the year. And so, you know, there are different paths here, to be honest. And it really will just depend on the level of deposits, the level of interest rates, just how the pale of some of the climate deposit or pricings that we've described come through, or the back end of those. So I gave some, you know, a high level view, but Brian, I think there's a range of scenarios. But we do have some confidence in the expectation that in aggregate, NII will be down 5% from a full-year basis, and that's quite a bit better than the down 10% that we had previously guided towards. Brian Bedell : Right, yes. Then if I just get -- if I use the flattish assumption, I'm more like flat for the year on that cadence, but would that be sort of a, as you said, a range, but a flat NII outcome year-over-year would be at the better end of your range, or is that sort of really difficult to achieve? Eric Aboaf : No, let me try to clarify. We expect total NII to be down 5% on a year-on-year basis for the full-year. What I did say is that we expect NII to be in 3Q and 4Q to be roughly the same, to be flattish between those two quarters. And so, you know, now the question is exactly how much does it come down in second quarter, and then from second quarter into the combination of third and fourth quarter, how much does that come down? And there is a range of different scenarios I think you could foresee. But the reason we're trying not to over-spec the exact quarter by quarter by quarter by quarter expectation is there's just underlying volatility out there in the kind of macroeconomic conditions in the risk on risk off sentiment in the central bank's actions right. And then in our client deposit levels. And so hopefully that gives you enough context to go on. Brian Bedell : That's super helpful. And then maybe just on the private markets wins, it sounds like momentum is improving there. Maybe if you could just talk about what your pipeline is looking like in private markets, Alpha and kind of your expectations over the next one to two years? Ron O'Hanley: Brian, it's Ron. I mean, we've talked about the private businesses being a double-digit growth business. We stand by that. We see lots of potential growth. Private markets, Alpha is developing nicely for us, largely for some of the -- for many of the same reasons that Alpha itself has. It's an opportunity as these firms become more complex, have complex operating and technology stacks. It's a way to not just lower some costs, but improve operations and future-proof operations. So it's developing well. So we remain optimistic about it. Brian Bedell : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from David Smith at Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. David Smith : Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about your capital priorities today? Your payout ratio in the first quarter was somewhat below your 100% full-year target? Eric Aboaf : David, it's Eric. We gave guidance at the beginning of the year on a full-year basis purposely, right, because each quarter there's going to be a different set of variables as we navigate through. So we described capital return in aggregate to be around total earnings for the year and we reaffirmed that in our prepared remarks. If you then go into the specifics of the first quarter, remember we had expected a normalization of the lower than usual RWA that came through in the fourth quarter. Some of that is just market factors playing through on the FX book. Some of that is equity markets upticking in the agency and securities financing space. And some of it, to be honest, is just putting capital to work with our clients, where we're engaging with them, and that's driving some of the fee revenue growth that you saw. At the same time, our priority is to get capital back to shareholders. We continued our dividend at pace, as you'd expect. We had some buybacks this quarter. If you do the math, that buyback activity will increase going forward for the next few quarters. We also had the new information about the FDIC assessment. And so we had to accrue for that expense instead of returning capital to shareholders for this particular quarter. So anyway, just a way to describe, we're on track with our priority and to be honest, our commitment to get capital back to shareholders in line with earnings this year. And it will just -- every quarter is a little bit different, but I think you'll see that accelerate into the second quarter. David Smith : And I think you gave the tax rate for the second quarter. Are you still expecting 21% to 22% for the full-year? Eric Aboaf : I think I need to quickly go back to the January remarks, but we did not update those and -- so I think that's a good place, a good estimate to use for the full-year, the one that you had back on the January call. Yes, that's correct. David Smith : Okay. And just one last cleanup. The preferred dividend, they'll still be elevated in the $50 million to $55 million range in the second quarter, but then it will be kind of more like $40 million in the second-half of the year? Eric Aboaf : Yes. Yes, that's correct. We're just kind of moving through this past quarter 1 and quarter 2 between the redemptions, the issuance and redemptions and then literally, the tactical timing of some of the dividends, you've got it right. There's one more quarter of elevation in the $50 million to $55 million range next quarter, meaning second quarter and then it will run at about $40 million a quarter from third quarter onwards. David Smith : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Can you hear me? Ron O\u2019Hanley: We can. Mike Mayo : Can you talk about the relationship between stock markets and revenues you used to have for every 10% change the S&P 500, it impacts your servicing fees by x amount. Can you remind us what that is these days and how much of a lag there is with that? And along with that, I guess your guidance for NII instead of being down 10% to down 5%. What exactly changed the last kind of month or so? Eric Aboaf : Yes, Mike, it's Eric. Let me answer those in reverse order. On NII, what happened in the first quarter was really higher deposit balances across the interest-bearing stock and even relative to our expectations on noninterest-bearing in March. So that changed in a positive way, created an uplift into the first quarter that we had not expected. The last time we gave full-year guidance on NII was back in January when we expected it to be down, on a full year basis, 10% for the full-year. And it's only today that we've reassessed that. We did not reassess that back at the beginning of March. We reassessed that today. And what we're factoring in is the higher step off, the higher level of deposits with us generally. And the fewer rate cuts that we're expecting from central banks around the world. And so that's what gets us to a better full-year guide on NII. If I then turn to the equity market question, how it factors through servicing fees. We need to be -- we need to go through it in pieces. And so let me start. First, what matters to us is not just the S&P equity index, because we're global, right? More than 40% of our revenues are broad, including in emerging markets. And while the S&P is up year-on-year 28%. The All-World Index is up only 18%, and that's what's more material to our financial statements given the international and global footprint that we have. With that 18%, we'd expect a substantial tailwind of servicing fees on a year-on-year basis and up 4% to 5% range, typically. But it tends to move around. As you said, sometimes there's a bit of timing there. Sometimes there's a bit of mix there and so forth. What we did see that was a headwind to that this year were two things : one was the previously announced client transition, and that was worth about 2 points of servicing fee headwinds; and then we've continued to see a lower -- or I'll describe different level of client activity that was worth almost 2 percentage points of headwind this year, some of which we think is cyclical. Some of that is transactional activity that we've talked about that we tend to get paid for on a unit basis through our fee schedules. And then this quarter, we also referenced the shift to client cash and cash equivalents within the AUC/A stack, which tends to come in at a much lower fee rate for custody and accounting services. And so those were the pieces that went against us. Mike Mayo : And just one follow-up, just -- you said more-than-expected deposits. Why was that? Eric Aboaf : I think the more-than-expected deposits is really driven by two factors. One, is that there tends to be more cash in the system, in the banking system today. We think that's a mix of central bank actions, in particular, in the U.S., the reduction in the overnight repo operation that the Fed is running. That comes back in a way into our clients or into the banking system. And that's been a -- I think that's generally improved liquidity conditions or added to what is -- our very liquid conditions have made them even more liquid. And then the second factor, to be honest, is over the last 1.5 years, two years, we've been very engaged, and I'd say, increasingly engaged with clients on where they put their cash. They put their cash with us in deposits, in repo, in money market, in money market suites, because every one of those areas we offer services to our clients. And I think what we've done over time is sharpened our engagement with our clients, and that's resulted in more cash and deposits with us in a way that we find is healthy, obviously, for our balance sheet. We're always delighted to keep cash, but also helps with earnings and margin and economically. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Rajiv Bhatia at Morningstar. Please go ahead. Rajiv Bhatia : Great. Good morning. Can you comment on how the pricing environment is for your servicing business? If inflation remains higher for longer, should we expect lower pricing headwinds? And then as I understand it, about 60% of your service fees is asset-based. How do pricing headwinds compare in the asset-based bucket versus the non-asset-based bucket? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : It's a broad question. We've been in an environment, I think, the last four years or so where we've seen pricing headwinds in the servicing business to be roughly in the 2% headwind level. And that's kind of -- that will float around a bit by quarter. It will float around on the margin a little bit by year, but it's substantially below what we had seen way back in 2019. And which was, I'll describe, a bubble of repricing. I described it that way because during this time, we've seen, to your point, a very accentuated rise in inflation. We've now seen a partial reduction in inflation. And that's not really had a large or substantial effect to our general fee rates or our -- or servicing fees. And so it's been -- I think it's not particularly determinative of that. In terms of our fee schedules, you're right, the fee schedules have several components. They have asset-based. There's an asset under custody basis for some of the fees which is about half. There are some transactional fees. There are just some flat fees. There are some per account fees. And those usually end up being negotiated as a package. It's not that when there is a -- when we have negotiations that one particular part of that package is treated very differently. We have large, sophisticated clients. They think of it as a package. And to be honest, they're looking for a fair set of -- a fair amount of fees so that as a partnership, which lasts often 10, 15, 20, in some cases, 30, 40 years, right? That they feel they're getting value and that they feel that we, as a custodian can deliver on what their expectations are. And so it comes to be a reasonable accommodation, I think, in our minds, in their minds. Rajiv Bhatia : Got it, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Next question will be from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Please go ahead, Ken. Ken Usdin : Thanks, Ron, Eric, sorry for that earlier. Sorry for that earlier. Just one follow-up on just the servicing fee algorithm. So with all the commentary you've made. And you show us the good detail about the business wins and the fees to come on, and we know about the headwinds, some cyclical, some due to deconversion. Do you have a line of sight when we can really start to see that back office line start to move up in a positive way. And I know we have to consider the middle office and the whole front office kit as a together thing. But that's still the biggest line, and that's still kind of flattish on a year-over-year basis with all the things we talked about. But is there any path forward where you can kind of see some of those headwinds abating and some of the growth starting to come on and transitions that we can see a better growth rate overall? Thanks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Ken, why don't I start here? The transition, I know it feels like it's been going on forever, but that will basically abate. And the effect of that will go away, more or less go away next year, assuming no other changes on the client side. So a headwind goes to zero. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, you've seen -- you saw the sales performance last year. You're seeing the sales performance this year that's building up the to be installed business. That still remains very, very high for us. Part of it is some complicated kinds of Alpha clients that they will install, they are installing -- they typically tend to install in waves and tranches. So we'll make progress against that. But I would note from sales performance last year and it continued in the quarter, there's a fair amount of back office in some of these recent sales, which just installs faster. And so we're quite optimistic about the opportunities here in fee revenue growth, particularly servicing fee revenue growth as you overcome headwinds, but more importantly, start to reap the benefits of what we've sold in Alpha, what we sold in back office and get those installed. Eric Aboaf : And Ken, it's Eric. I would just add that we've had these client activity headwinds that we described, which is a mix of risk-off sentiment, which has led to lower transactions through the custodial accounts. And then we've described this shift towards a cash mix, right? We don't see those just continuing at the same pace. We see that as somewhat cyclical. You'd expect -- I don't think we generally expect much more cash to be on hand with clients. There are -- I think there's a case to be made that cash levels of client should actually start to get deployed over the next year and could even be neutral or a possible tailwind. So I think we've been going through a bit of a cyclical phase here on those environmental and activity type and mix headwinds. And I think without those, you could then see through to some of what Ron described around sales, installation and the underlying growth of the franchise. Ken Usdin : Okay. And one follow-up then is also we can see the wins and what you put on and the yet to be installed to Ron's point. Can you just talk about just the pipeline, is the pipeline continuing to strengthen? Is it consistent? Have you now put more of that pipeline through? Where do we stand on that? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yes. Ken, I mean, I think what you should have heard from us today is that we have a sales target that we talked about in January, we're standing by that sales target. That's significantly up from last year, which was significantly up from the year before. So I mean you get there because of the pipeline. So we're encouraged by our pipeline. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Ron for closing remarks. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, thanks to all of you on the call for joining us. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution in whole or in part without the expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. Now, I would like to introduce, Liz Lynn, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street. Elizabeth Lynn : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley will speak first; then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our second quarter 2024 earnings presentation, which is available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our presentation. In addition, today's presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those factors in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them, even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Before we begin today\u2019s discussion, I want to acknowledge the assassination attempt on former President Trump. It was a horrible act of violence that has no place in our democracy and must be condemned. We are relieved that former President was not seriously harmed and we are saddened by the tragic loss of innocent lives and injury that resulted from this senseless action. Each victim was a participant in our democratic process, which makes this an act -- which makes us act an affront to all. We extend our thoughts and condolences to all those impacted. At this time, we hope for unity and respect in our country. Disagreement can and must sit along civility and a commitment to an even better America. Now turning to the second quarter. Earlier today, we released our financial results, which represented sustain momentum as we delivered good year-over-year fee and total revenue growth in both 2Q and for the first half of the year, along with continued expense discipline. This resulted in modest positive total operating leverage, pre-tax margin of almost 29% and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter. We also continued to take important steps in the transformation and simplification of our operating model as we successfully consolidated our second operations joint venture in India in the quarter. These actions will enable State Street to continue to improve client experience and will unlock further productivity savings in the years ahead. In May, the transition to T+1 settlement was a significant event for global investors. Importantly, it presented State Street with an opportunity to demonstrate our position as an essential partner to our clients. Our role in successfully assisting clients through this transition reinforced our value to clients and underscored the depth of our operational capabilities. The financial market context in 2Q was mixed. While daily average global equity market levels continued to move higher and equity markets again reached new all-time highs in the second quarter, gains continued to be narrowly concentrated in a few names. Meanwhile, fixed income markets struggled in 2Q as geopolitical risks continued, economic data generally remained robust, and investors priced in a more gradual cycle of rate cuts, even as the ECB delivered its first rate cuts since the pandemic. For this market backdrop, we remain focused and successfully executed against our key strategic. Turning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation, I will review our 2Q highlights before Eric takes you through the quarter in more detail. Beginning with our financial performance, second quarter EPS was $2.15 as compared to $2.17 in the year-ago period. The durable nature of our business was evident in the quarter as year-over-year strength in management fees, FX trading and NII more than offset a previously disclosed client transition that negatively impacted servicing fee revenues, helping to drive revenue growth of 3%. We also remain focused on tightly managing our cost base, while continuing to make investments in our businesses, 2Q total expenses increased by less than 3% year-over-year, supported by our ongoing productivity efforts. Turning to our business momentum, while you can see -- which you can see in the middle of the page, we continue to execute well against our strategy, making progress in a number of key areas and to generating further fee revenue growth, which gives us confidence in our positioning as we look ahead. Within asset services, we generated AUC/A wins of $291 billion, which was well distributed regionally, and included more than $200 billion faster to install back office custody in line with our targeted sales strategy. Encouragingly, roughly a quarter of the AUC/A wins this quarter came from Alpha mandate in the APAC region. The win is a large new client for State Street covering a broad set of our services, including the back office. This mandate is another proof point that Alpha is an attractive client value proposition globally. Alpha creates a clear competitive advantage for State Street that strategically positions us to deepen existing client relationship and as demonstrated this quarter win new long-term client relationships in turn, helping to drive future growth. This ongoing new business performance coupled with an anticipated increase in installations positions us well for future servicing fee growth. Servicing fee revenue wins amounted to $72 million, up from $67 million in the first quarter. This is the fourth quarter in a row of strong servicing fee revenue wins totaling over $330 million over the last 12 months. Our pipeline is strong, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales goal of $350 million to $400 million this year. At Global Advisors, buoyed by higher average equity markets, 2Q management fees were $511 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year with AUM reaching a record $4.4 trillion at quarter end. While GA experienced aggregate net outflows in the quarter, it was largely driven by a limited number of client rebalancing. Encouragingly, we continue to make progress in a number of key strategic focus areas. For example, total net ETF inflows amounted to $6 billion benefited from continued market share expansion in U.S low cost equity ETFs. Regionally, we also saw spider gain market share in EMEA. Elsewhere, Global Advisors announced the planned strategic investment in Envestnet, a leading provider of integrated technology data and wealth solutions. This investment consistent with State Street's wealth services strategy, will enhance Global Advisors access to the independent wealth advisory and high-net-worth distribution channels driving future growth. NII performance was strong, driven by a number of targeted management actions over the last year to support NII growth. These include increased engagement with our clients to offer them financing -- financing and cash solutions, resulting in higher deposit, loan and sponsor repo balances, while we also carefully expanded our investment portfolio in 2Q. These actions have contributed to three quarters in a row of sequential NII and revenue growth, as well as positive total operating leverage in 2Q. Our balance sheet remains strong, enabling over $400 million of capital return in the second quarter, and over $700 million year-to-date. Our financial strength was evident with the release of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test results in June. Subsequently and consistent with our commitment to return capital to our shareholders, we were pleased to announce our intention to increase State Street's quarterly common stock dividend by 10% to $0.76 per share, beginning in the third quarter, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. As we look ahead, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders this year, subject to market conditions and other factors. To conclude, our strong start to the year continued in the second quarter. We delivered both fee and total revenue growth, which support in modest total operating leverage year-over-year, and a return on equity of nearly 12% in the quarter, all while continuing to make significant investments in our business, controlling expenses and returning capital to our shareholders. I am pleased with the progress we're making to drive better business momentum in sales performance as we execute against the sharpened revenue strategy. We recorded another Alpha mandate win in the quarter, which demonstrated the clear advantage that strategy brings to our organization by delivering a large and completely new client relationship to State Street. We already have good line of sight into 3Q and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our goals of 6 to 8 new Alpha clients, and $350 million to $400 million of servicing revenue -- fee revenue wins this year. And with that, let me hand the call over to Eric, who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we reported EPS of $2.15 for the quarter as compared to $2.17 in the second quarter a year ago. EPS was slightly lower year-on-year, but would have been positive growth were it not for an $80 million reserve release last year. As Ron noted, we delivered 3% revenue growth year-over-year reflecting both higher net interest income up 6% as well as higher fee revenues up 2%, which supported modestly positive total operating leverage in the quarter. The second quarter strong performance contributed to an encouraging first half of the year, with both positive fee and positive total operating leverage on a year-to-date basis, excluding notable items relative to the prior year period. Turning now to Slide 4, period end AUC/A and AUM again increased record levels largely supported by market tailwinds. As you can see on the right panel of the slide, market indicators related to our trading business remain challenging in the quarter that we were pleased to see improved client volumes across our FX trading venues, which I will discuss shortly. Turning to Slide 5, servicing fees declined 2% year-on-year, as higher average equity market levels and net new business excluding our previously disclosed client transition were more than offset by pricing headwinds, and lower client activity and adjustments, including the asset mix shift into lower earning cash and cash equivalents. The impact of the previously disclosed client transition with a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity and adjustments including the asset mix shift into cash was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point on year on year growth. In addition, we saw the pace of quarterly installations track below expectations in 1Q and 2Q. We do, however, anticipate a pickup over the next few quarters as our higher level of recent sales begin to onboard. Sequentially, servicing fees were up 1% reflecting higher average equity market levels and client activity as transaction volumes tick back up and we saw clients start to put cash back to work. We generated $72 million of servicing fee revenue wins in 2Q and more than $330 million over the last four quarters, with the vast majority in back office, consistent with our strategy to prioritize faster installing custody mandates. At period end, we had $276 million of servicing fee revenues to be installed and $2.4 trillion of AUC/A to be installed. Moving to Slide 6, management fees were up 11% year-on-year primarily reflecting our higher average market levels and net inflows from prior periods, partially offset by the impact of our strategic ETF repricing initiative, which we believe is starting to pay off in both volumes and revenues. Sequentially, the benefit of higher average market levels was offset by net flows and lower performance fees. We are pleased with the steady growth we are delivering in Global Advisors. In the second quarter, we continue to expand the breadth of our offerings with the launch of new funds as we continue to broaden our product range in geographies. Our investment management business had healthy pre-tax margin of 32% in the second quarter, up 3 percentage points year-on-year and up 8 percentage points quarter-on-quarter. Now turning to Slide 7, as I noted, we saw a very nice uptick in client activity in our markets business with higher volumes across our major FX venues. This helped to drive FX trading revenue growth of 11% year-on-year, though volatility remained muted with compressed margin. Securities finance revenues also benefit from higher balances on both agency lending and prime services. However, our U.S Specials activity was subdued in the quarter which impacted margins and contributed to the year-on-year decline in securities finance revenues. Moving to software and processing fees, second quarter performance continued to benefit from strong client engagement with CRD. Though the cadence of on-premise renewals negatively impacted year-on-year performance which is shown in greater detail on the following slides. On Slide 8, as you can see, software enabled and professional services revenues increased 17% in the quarter. And we expect these revenues to represent a greater proportion of our front office software and data business over time as we transition another 20 clients from on-premise to more durable SaaS model over the last year. As we outlined in May, we believe our software business can be a significant revenue growth driver for State Street, potentially reaching a $1 billion in annual revenues over the next 5 years. In addition, we were pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing in Alpha. We reported an additional Alpha mandate win and 2 mandates went live in 2Q, bringing the total number of live mandates to 23 at quarter end. As Ron mentioned, this quarter's Alpha win represents a brand new 10-year relationship with a large APAC client. We view long-term Alpha mandates like this are a key benefit of our differentiated Alpha strategy. Turning to Slide 9. NII was stronger-than-expected this quarter, up 6% year-on-year and up 3% sequentially to $735 million as higher investment portfolio yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit mix shift in both periods. In addition, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, we proactively increased our investment portfolio balances at higher yields which benefited NII. Looking at the strong quarterly performance relative to our expectations in early June, we did see an inflow of valuable noninterest bearing deposits in mid June and again in late June as clients geared up for the holiday weekend, although I would note that we did see some reversal during the first week of July. Similarly, NII also benefited from higher interest bearing balances due to our client engagement efforts, as well as better spreads and volumes within our sponsored repo business as more clients join the program. Average deposits increased 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. We would expect to continue to operate at this higher level of deposit balances as we look to the back half of the year. Turning to Slide 10, year-on-year expense growth was contained to less than 3%. In the second quarter, we continue to invest in the business while also delivering productivity benefits in two key areas. The first is associated with our decision to consolidate two operations joint ventures in India late last year and this quarter. The year-on-year savings associated with these two JV consolidations are approximately $20 million in the quarter, excluding integration costs. Second, we benefited from our ongoing organizational process improvements and initiatives, including streamlining and delayering staff [ph] functions to increase our management's span of control, which enabled us to lower our headcount on a pro forma basis, including the JVs by 5 percentage points year-on-year as detailed on the bottom left of the slide. Together, these actions helped to drive down compensation benefit costs by 2% year-on-year in the second quarter, and facilitate our ability to reinvest in our franchise. The combination of the JV consolidations, along with our ongoing initiatives serves as a catalyst and importantly gives us confidence as we continue to deliver on our strategy to simplify our global operating model with meaningful benefits expected to build over time, including more productivity saves, as well as an ability to better serve our clients and invest for the future. Moving to Slide 11, as you can see, our capital levels remained strong and comfortably above the regulatory minimums. As of quarter end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.2% was slightly higher from the prior quarter, as capital generated from earnings was partially offset by continued dividends and share repurchases, as well as higher RWAs as we support our clients, which in turn drove higher fees and NII. We returned over $300 million in the first quarter to shareholders, followed by $400 million through common share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter, as we've tried to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and the support of our clients. Looking ahead to the back half of the year, we have announced the plan 10% per share quarterly common dividend increase on the heels of a strong performance on this year's CCAR starting in 3Q and subject to Board approval. In addition, our attention is to accelerate the pace of quarterly buybacks relative to the first half of the year. However, given the more modest level of repurchase activity so far this year, the full year payout ratio for 2024 will likely be closer to the 80% to 90% range, in line with our medium term targets. In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results, which demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustained business momentum, while delivering positive total operating leverage excluding notable items. With that, let me cover our improved full year outlook, which I would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the uncertain economic and political environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro assumptions, as we stand here today, we are assuming global equity markets are flattered to second quarter end for the remainder of the year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve as of quarter end, while we expect both FX market volatility and specials to remain needed. Given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels, we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be in the range of up 4% to 5% on a full year basis, somewhat better than our prior expectations for roughly 4% year-on-year growth. Turning to NII, given our 2Q performance, along with the continued benefit of management actions we have taken to support NII growth this year, we now expect full year NII will be up slightly year-over-year, which is also better than our previous guide of down roughly 5% on a full year basis. Finally, given these improved top line expectations, full year expenses are likely to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook of up 2.5% this year. We now expect expenses excluding notable items to be up about 3% this year, given the expected revenue related costs. Importantly, given this improved outlook, we now expect to deliver both positive fee operating leverage and positive total operating leverage for the full year excluding notable items. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. Operator, we can open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks so much. Question on Global Advisors. You had some institutional lead outflows in the last two quarters, despite the strong markets. I'm just curious how much of that is a function of rebalancing? And are we supposed to expect more going forward given the strong equity markets? And are you seeing similar trends in your custody base? Thanks. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Glenn. It's Ron. You have it correct there. The most of it, the vast majority of it is around client rebalancing. In one case, an extremely large client that\u2019s rebalancing away from certain act -- from certain asset classes. So it's idiosyncratic. We don't expect it to continue. And we feel very comfortable with the trajectory that Global Advisors is on both the institutional business and in ETF business. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Ron, what would have you -- there's been several articles over the last year or so talking about a certain European bank potentially selling their servicing platform. You've been linked to it as you should be. You've been great in consolidating things in the past. So I'm not asking you to comment on that, I am asking at some shareholders just preferred buybacks, which you might think is near-term. I'm curious on your thoughts conception on how you approach these things, if there were any lessons learned from the Brown Brothers Harriman saga [ph], and just conceptually how you're thinking about any consolidation opportunities and services. Thanks. Ron O'Hanley: So, Glenn, I mean, we've been pretty consistent about this. We have a very, very strong market position. Now some of that, in the past has been built by M&A if you go back to the 2000s. But if you think about where we are now, it's very strong and the vast majority of our activity is around organic build out of our business. Some of that, just in terms of, focusing on clients within geographies, and some of that focused on building capabilities and extending them to other geographies. That is, by far the -- what our focus is. To the extent and I've said this in the past, I mean, M&A is not a strategy, but it can help us to effectively implement our strategy and it is superior to passes the test of being superior to a return of capital to shareholders, then we'll consider it. But our focus is on building out organically, returning capital to shareholders at a reasonable pace and continuing to accelerate what we do. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Ron. Elizabeth Lynn : Operator, can we move to the next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. So great results on the NII and we heard the updated outlook for slightly up this year now. Eric, just wondering, that would still imply a lower second half versus this really strong second quarter. And I know there's a lot of uncertainty still out there in the environment. So can you just help us think through what are you contemplating in terms of how deposits track from here, and what caveats should we continue to think in mind if in fact, there is still second half comes off of this, the second quarter real strength? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Ken, its Eric. As you said, we're pleased with the second quarter results on NII. Some of that is the interest rate environment. But a good portion of that is the management actions we've been taking in terms of engaging with our clients on deposits. And really being there for them on both sides of the balance sheet, as we lend and support their growth as well. This quarter was particularly strong. We had a nice tailwind from long-term rates during the quarter that helped you saw us build out our investment portfolio a little more. Deposits ticked up second half of June and towards the end, especially noninterest bearing. But what I find pleasing is that deposits are coming in stronger across the -- what I will call the pricing stack, the transactional deposits, the exception price deposits and initiatives. So across the spectrum and that's really a testament to the engagement that we've had with our clients to be there. I think as we look forward into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we still see some of the headwinds and tailwinds that we've talked about, short-term rates seem like will start to trend down that'll be a little bit of a headwind. Deposits, we're still seeing some of that rotation from noninterest bearing to interest bearing that is slowing. That was -- that rotated out about $2 billion this past quarter and that's been less than the prior quarters. But that still continues and still a little bit of pricing and mix shift that we're seeing in the interest bearing deposit base. So that -- that we see is just playing out through the end of the year, but at a more modest pace. The offsets to that are mix of long-term rates, the lending, that we continue to do, lendings up double digits and that's been purposeful to support our clients and to support NII. And then, tactically adjusting the investment portfolio. And so it's the net of those that probably will come in with some erosion over the next couple of quarters. But we're seeing a place where deposits are come in at a nice and robust level on our balance sheet. Lending continues. And so, we're getting to a point where we're going to start to see I think an inflection of NII and a bottoming, which is nice. And we can see that over the next a few quarters. Hard to tell exactly when, but with the headwinds and tailwinds kind of I'll say equalizing over time, it gives us a good basis to look forward. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then one -- Ron, one question. You mentioned that you think that core fees growth should get better from here, and just wanted to ask you to deepen on that a little bit. I mean, I know that you've mentioned the onboarding and such, but we still have that deconversion working against, and you mentioned the episodic stuff in the ETF stuff. But like -- I think that's really people are looking for on the increment. So is that what drives that incrementally better fee guide for the second half? Is that we're finally going to see like those that servicing and management fee line start to show a better rate of change? Ron O'Hanley: Yes. So there's -- I think you largely have it. But let me go a little bit deeper, Ken, because if you think about -- let's talk about core servicing fees, what really drives it? First is retention. Second is the amount and rate of onboarding. And then third is do business and sales, and then rinse and repeat. And our retention levels which they -- we've talked about them before and we're continuing to track well against them even coming a little bit higher than what we had planned. Second onboardings, as Eric noted, they've been slower than expected this year. But we see lots of visibility going forward to that increasing. We've got a big book there to onboard and that will start to onboard and -- it should start to onboard in accelerating rate. And then third is sales. And there's two things going on there. One, the amounts we opted in '23, we opted again in '24. We're on track for that increased servicing fee -- sales target. But we also have disproportionate focus on traditional back office fees, either standalone, or if they're associated with Alpha, making sure that when an Alpha assignment comes on board, the back office conversions occur first. And that's part of the learning this whole Alpha process. So that by itself gives us encouragement, and then -- and Eric will probably want to go into this a little bit more, the deconversion that seems like we talked about forever. I mean, we're hitting bottom right now in terms of that. So we'll start to see improvement on that as a comp and as its effect and move beyond it, starting in the next quarter or two. So that's servicing fees. And management fees, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing at SSJ. It's been -- it's part of a carefully crafted strategy, both in the institutional ETFs. We've talked about ETF flows, we've talked about market share and the very important low cost ETFs, which, in effect represent penetration into the retail market, all that is working well. And then finally, we had this historically low volatility in FX. Nonetheless, the team has been highly focused on continuing to build share within our clients to move up on the panels. And [indiscernible] saw some of that pay off in terms of FX in securities finance. Again, there's been a new strategy in place there and some progress there. So this is much of what we do is a game of inches. But there's a lot of inches coming together here that we feel quite good about. Ken Usdin : Great. Thanks, Ron. Operator : Your next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I would like to start with euro deposits, the ECB cut rates this quarter. So I'm curious to hear I know, a euro I believe is your second biggest currency in your deposit base. So curious about what impact that you saw from that cut? Where was the beta on that cut? And was it roughly equivalent to the beta [ph] as you saw on the final increases? And based on that experience, how does that inform your expectation for only see cuts in the fed funds. Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric. It's nice to see the industry environment top out and begin to reverse, though I think it'll reverse slowly. We've seen the beginning of that and feels like it'll take some time, which is -- which will be fine because remember, our portfolio and our balance sheet is roughly neutral and relatively insulated now from interest rate increases or decreases. We have a slight sensitivity across the balance sheet, but it's light. It's -- if all central banks across the curve cut rates by 25 basis points, we're talking about $5 million per quarter impact on a $2.5 billion base of a full year NII. So that's the -- we're talking about small effects. To your point euro is a good place to start because euro rates increased lagged on the way up and now are starting to move in the opposite direction. We have said, and the euro experience on this first rate move has demonstrated that we expect largely to see symmetry in the betas. So as we -- as rates rose, we lagged and then the betas increased over time towards the back end of the rate cycle. And what we've said is, area by area transaction rate deposits, exception rate deposits, and the initial rate deposits, will tend to see the reversal of that. And so, specifically in euros, we did see that. We -- the beta and the first tick down was similar to the beta on the last tick up and I think is a good representation largely of what we expect to see. And that means that, if you step back even further, we feel like our pricing is set at a healthy level. We have a range of pricing and pools of deposits, and in a way have built real engagement with our clients. So they understood the model as floated up. And similarly they understand the model as rates floated down in the balance of trade, and it comes together nicely. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks for that. Thanks for that. I appreciate it. On thinking about another factor that has been a bit more robust recently repo has been pretty strong in recent quarters. Do you think based on what's been happening in the marketplace, that strength is sustainable? And it seems as though the NII story is playing out better than you had originally anticipated, obvious given you brought up guidance, but is that another x factor that could allow for the back half of the year to maybe see less of a pronounced step down, then your improved guidance seems to continue to embed? Eric Aboaf : Brennan, it's Eric again. There's been a lot of talks about repo. Now we're saying that most of the NII we earn on our balance sheet is really based on deposit funding and lending. So 90% of our NII is around deposits, loans, investment portfolio. We're talking about 10%, which is on repo. So just for context and it is true repo NII came in a little bit better-than-expected in the second quarter, why? Because there was some dislocation in overnight repo operation of the Fed relative to SOFR. So clients came our way. We also saw dealer balance sheet strain, but the higher than expectation was in the $5 million to $10 million range. It's not a -- it was nice to take. And it was nice to be there for our clients. But in fact, repo has been relatively flat to actually, down a smidge over the last couple of quarters. And that's because it tends to be a thinner margin, but a useful way to accommodate our clients. And we think it's not going to be a large driver of the coming NII. It's fully included in our guide. I think the real big moving parts are really around deposits loans and then followed by investment portfolio and the mix of long and short rates that we'll see. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Your line is open. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Eric, maybe just following up a little bit on the NII story, you talk about potentially an inflection coming. Can you discuss maybe the timing of that? And then when I look at your asset yields, the HTM book is still weighing that down. Can you talk about maybe the pace of maturity on that HTM book that's yielding a little over 2%? And how much -- how long it takes to kind of get that back -- coming back in? Is that a big part of your inflection story next year? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Jim, it's Eric. Calling a -- an inflection or a turn in NII is one of the hardest things to do. And so we've been -- our outlook is that in the next few quarters, we'll begin to see that, but we'll first go from the trends that we're seeing to a stabilization, it'll bounce around some, and then over time tick upwards. The factors are multifaceted. And with a number of ins and outs, you're right, the investment portfolios turning over, it turned over quite a bit in the second half of last year, it's now turning over by about 3, maybe $3 billion to $4 billion a quarter, and that's across HTM and AFS. And because there are some longer dated bonds in HTM, those roll through a little more slowly. But in a way that we have is a sustained amount of, I'll say, tailwind that comes with that because remember the roll-ons in the portfolio versus the roll-offs, those are worth a solid 250 basis point of spread differential. And that'll play through the books as a nice tailwind, assuming long rate stay, somewhere in the area, and we -- and the primary change on the curve is at the front end. So, I think it'll be a component. Right now the biggest component is really the deposit mix pricing levels of noninterest bearing, that's what's moving the needle the most. I mean, all these factors matter. And I think as the deposits stabilize, and we've started to see total deposit levels stabilize last few quarters, we have to see now the mix stabilize. Once that happens, the natural benefit from the investment portfolio rolling through, right, and then the growth in loans, and you've seen us lean into lending. Lending is up more than 10% year-on-year, because we're trying to be out there for our clients. And as we lend to our clients, they actually often do additional servicing business with us. That factor in the investment portfolio and the long-term rates will then turn to a net positive impact on NII in the coming quarters. James Mitchell : Okay. That's really helpful. And maybe just to your point on deposit growth being a key driver, now that we're looking at rate cuts, Q2 [ph] is less. Do you feel like rate cuts can be a catalyst for growth based on historical experience? How do you think about getting back to kind of more normal growth levels in deposits? What do we need to say? Eric Aboaf : I think the direct answer is that the rate environment has moved around quite a bit. And we've seen the deposit effects from the rate environment. I think those are relatively been -- those have been telegraphed through the banking system. And we've also seen the Fed balance sheet actions as they've been tightening conditions with their balance sheet, although that slowing and the overnight reverse repo operation is an easing, we've seen that telegraphed through. So I think the exogenous factors that have driven deposits over the last 2 years have largely been telegraphed. And the modest number of interest rate cuts, I don't expect to have that much of an impact on deposit levels. We'll see, but that's our kind of sense from talking with our clients and analyzing the vast array of data that we have. What we feel will make the difference over time is sales. So we talk a lot about servicing fee sales, targeting $350 million to $400 million this year, that's up from $300 million the year before and even less than the year before that. And with a tilt towards custody and remember, it's the custodial activity, not just the accounting or the middle office, but the custodial activity that brings with it balances, deposit balances, because they're needed as part of the, the buffer or the -- to handle the transactional activities that we process for clients. And so as we look forward, as sales continue to accelerate, and then we onboard those sales because both have to happen. That's what we expect will bring on additional deposits in a way are part of our organic growth model, which will bring fee growth, but also bring deposit growth and thus NII into the system at a -- I think at a nice rate, and it'll be year by year by year that that'll help drive growth. James Mitchell : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Oh, hi. Good morning. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I did just want to key off of the last comment around the sales. And to your point $350 million to $400 million is the goal for this year. Obviously, on Page 5, you show us what the rev wins are for 1Q and 2Q, 67 and 72. So that leaves us with an expectation that you're going to be able to bump that up pretty aggressively towards the 105 level for each of 3Q and 4Q. And so it gets to my question of what gives you the confidence in that? Is that a function of these are already sales that are in contract, and it's just the installation of the new wins that hits this page. And so that gives you a lot of confidence that you can generate that 105 level in each of the next two quarters. Ron O'Hanley: Betsy, its Ron. Let me take that. Firstly, just to clarify that the these numbers that we're talking about are sales and not installs, right. Betsy Graseck : Right. Ron O'Hanley: So, it wouldn't include anything that's under contract and subject to onboarding at this point. But what -- I mean, I think the way to think about it is, is this, that if you -- that's why Eric gave the four quarter number there. Third and fourth quarter historically for us tend to be a little bit better. Second half of the year is a little bit better than the first half of the year. So that's point number one. Point number two, the pipeline and we feel pretty good about the pipeline. So that's why we're continuing to affirm confidence in that target that we have of $350 million to $400 million. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Perfect. Yes, and I can see in last year, the second half was 3x 2Q. So, history, obviously shows that that should happen. So that's great. Okay, so then the follow-up \u2026 Ron O'Hanley: But, Betsy, let me clarify the first part of my message, because I was not clear there. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Ron O'Hanley: The number would include things that are in contract, but not include anything that's actually been on boarded. So when you see the to be onboarded number that we have out there, that includes basically past sales. So I hope that's clear. I didn't mean to confuse that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you. And then the follow-up just on the buyback. I understand you've got the opportunity for increasing buybacks and I'm expecting that you're going to be flexing that versus your SLR [ph] constraint is that fair? And with SLR at 6.3 and the minimum is 5, that feels like you've got a lot of room. So just want to understand how you're thinking about what the -- what level of SLR you want to hold regulatory minimum is 5, what kind of buffer should we expect that you're anticipating holding on top of that, just as we're working through our models on how much buybacks we estimate for you. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Betsy, it's Eric. Let me take that. As we had said and you're reflecting on buybacks were lighter, in first quarter at $100 million than we booked $200 million in second quarter, we expect that pace to accelerate into the third quarter and then again into the fourth quarter. So that's our intention and we have a good amount of room and capital generation each quarter to be able to deliver on that. In terms of the constraints, the ratio constraints, the most important one for us, and I think for our various stakeholders is the CET1 ratio. And that were -- I think we can continue to operate at a good pace, at a good level, but also that allows us a good pace of accelerating buybacks. The Tier 1 leverage or the supplementary leverage ratio are informative, but actually relatively manageable, right, with the right level of preferred equity we could -- we can operate where we need to. I think we've been clear on Tier 1 leverage what our range is, and we'll operate within that range. And we can adjust the preferred equity stack as necessary. We've not really formalized at least externally a supplementary leverage ratio range, but it -- I'd say, it kind of flows the -- in a similar way as the Tier 1 leverage and you can think of those as related from a conceptual and operational standpoint, and both of them are eminently manageable and are not really the constraint when it comes to common share buybacks. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. That's great. And then when we're thinking about the pace in accelerating from here, is that total dollars? Or is that the pace of up a 100 Q-on-Q? How should we think about which pace you're talking about? Eric Aboaf : It's when we talk buybacks, there's always the -- it depends on market conditions and the environment and so forth. So we always want to be careful with that. And you'd expect that of us as well, Ron and a management team, that's both careful, but also leans into capital return. And you've seen our commitment, I think, we'd certainly -- we certainly feel the $100 million in the first quarter, it was below what we would have liked to deliver. We feel the $200 million was below what we would have liked to deliver. So I think there's a solid increase coming. You can think about it in dollar terms, two points, begin to create a line but that could be a curve as well. And I think you've got enough to go on. I think you've got \u2026 Betsy Graseck : Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Eric Aboaf : \u2026 you\u2019ve got enough to go on. Betsy Graseck : Yes, I appreciate and I appreciate the conceptual chart. Thanks so much. Eric Aboaf : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying and not read too much into it. But I think what you're saying is over the next two quarters, you should be pretty much done with the NII declines. You\u2019re pretty much done with the management [indiscernible] and deposit declines. And you should be pretty much done with the decommission of the major client. Am I reading too much into that? Or did I hear that correctly? Eric Aboaf : Mike, it's Eric. With regard to NII and noninterest bearing deposits, I said the next few quarters. So, I'm giving myself a little bit of room to be honest, because it's hard to predict perfectly. And so I'll stick with a few quarters. I think that kind of works and that certainly covers your range, and maybe a little bit more. So, we just want to live through this. But we can see I think over the horizon here in a way and that's what we wanted to communicate. On the client deconversion, if you recall, we said this would be the largest year on a year-on-year basis. It was originally worth about 2 percentage points of total fees. We said about a percentage point year-on-year this year, half a point year-on-year last year, and about half a point year-on-year next year. So by the end of this year, we'll be through, I'll call it, three quarters of the effect, but they'll still be a piece of that coming through next year, and then it'll be behind us. Mike Mayo : And you also mentioned continuing pricing pressure, which we've talked about -- for about 30 years, which is nothing new. But you did highlight pricing pressure. So in what context are you referring to? I imagine like your new win in APAC -- I assume spreads are better in Asia and outside the U.S -- in the U.S. So you talked about pricing pressure. Where are you seeing it? Eric Aboaf : Mike, it's Eric again. I think we talked about pricing pressure because just part of the natural course of events, right, we get a market, we get pricing increasing -- increases from market upticks. And then with clients they ask for a part of that back. That's just how the business has operated, as you say, for the last 30 years. This quarter and last quarter and this year, and for the rest of the year, we expect pricing headwinds to be in line with the previous years and guidance. We've said pricing headwinds of about 2% per year. We're not seeing any more or any less of that. It tends to be a little more geared towards the asset manager segment, because those are the -- that is the group of clients that has mutual funds and some mutual fund versus ETF shifting. But it's not -- we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary or anything that is unexpected at this point. Mike Mayo : And then one last one to follow-up on that. I mean, I guess maybe as goes your clients, as goes any company or as goes [indiscernible] and with the record high stock markets and historically such a strong position with the mutual fund, which you just mentioned, are you seeing that uptick? Or is it still a slog for your big long only asset managers that are your legacy strength? Ron O'Hanley: Mike, it's Ron. Let me take that. I mean, I think that the -- as you would know as well as anybody, the business continues to change. And we've seen the continued move from the mutual fund to the ETF to the FMA. But you're also seeing these firms, particularly the well managed ones respond, and they're responding in a couple of ways. I mean, one new product types are -- I mean, even the most traditional mutual fund companies now have pretty interesting ETF lines. Most of -- they're involved in the DC 401(k) business, they've got a mutual fund offering, but they've got a collective trust offering too. So they're responding to that market pressure. Most of them are figuring out ways to participate in the wealth business, and we continue to respond and support them in that. So the nature of the business is changing. In some cases, some things were more lucrative than others. And so what you're also finding in those businesses, they're very focused on their cost base. Their technology stack, their operating stack, and again, that presses in our favor as we think about the Alpha front to back solution, we are the largest middle office provider by far in the industry and we've gotten quite good at that. So the -- we describe ourselves as an essential partner to our clients, and I think that plays through both in supporting them in their revenue and product activities as well as their cost and operations. Mike Mayo : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Thanks. Eric, I just have a quick follow-up trying to understand your NII guidance. Now look at your U.S interest bearing deposit costs, linked quarter they actually declined. Did you actually start cutting rates, or was there something else that drove that? Can you give some color on that? Is that likely to continue? Eric Aboaf : Vivek, it's Eric. It's -- I would describe that as just part of the normal volatility that we'll see in deposits. I mean we run such a large franchise and our clients transactional activity tends to vary over time. But we're seeing healthy levels of deposits across dollars, across euros. And so we didn't -- we haven't seen anything, particularly surprising in one area or another. I think, total U.S interest bearing deposits, if you look at our addendum are up slightly, euros are up slightly and so on and so forth. So -- and to the extent that there are some movements, not driven by our pricing actions, per se. In truth, clients need a certain amount of transactional deposits to fund their custody accounts. And the pricing tends to be something that we have negotiated and is well understood now, given where we are in the cycle and isn't the determinant [ph] of the of movements at this point. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. Ron, you mentioned in one of your answers about the servicing and management fees, that foreign exchange activity, the volatility was actually quite low relative to history. Can you share with us what drove that? And then second, what macro factors should we keep an eye on to see to drive that volatility higher as we go forward, especially in view of the geopolitical environment we're all living in? Ron O'Hanley: Well, I'll start, but Eric, [indiscernible]. But I think if -- what caused it, I mean, there's been really remarkably low dollar volatility. And I think some of the things that have been driving that : one is just the simple strength of the dollar for an awfully long time. And it's almost become too dangerous of thing to bet against the dollar. And so, even in times where you would expect to see some volatility, we simply haven't -- we haven't seen that. So I think that's been the primary driver that you've got this inordinate strength of the dollar. But Eric, [indiscernible] over to you. Eric Aboaf : Gerard, I think, to add to that, maybe in two ways. The dollar has been strong and continues to be the dominant currency globally for whether it's petrol, whether it's for core commodities, and the currency of choice. And what we've seen ebbs and flows in potential substitution euros, yuan [ph], et cetera, none of that is really come to pass. And so you have a bit of a stabilizing factor. I think the other thing that we've seen recently is because of the clients have been underweight -- I'm sorry, overweight in cash and underweight in equities and bonds, and they've started to put more of that cash to work, they're doing that both in the U.S and abroad and internationally. And as a result, there's not -- we're not seeing a lot of speculation in currency markets. We're seeing more, okay, I'll describe it as natural and transitional flows. And so we've not seen disruptions on one hand, knock on wood. And on the other hand, we have seen consistent holding of dollars and consistent buying of other currencies. And so, that's created -- it feels like a set of muted volatility levels that are fine for our clients. And our point of view is we need to serve clients during those times. And the more we can offer them ways to trade through us, through our multiple venues, some of them are platforms, some of them are single dealers, some are multi dealer, and then some of them are algos, we'll continue to do that and we'll support them and that'll because of the higher volumes we are seeing notwithstanding the lower volatilities has been fruitful and help drive revenue growth for us on that -- in that area. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you for that color. And circling back, you both touched on onboarding was slower-than-expected in the first half of the year, but you're expected to pick up as we go forward. What cause the slower-than-expected onboarding in the earlier part of this year? Ron O'Hanley: Eric, it's Ron. Excuse, Gerard, it's Ron. I'll take that. It's concentrated in some large clients that also happened to be development partners. And I think we've talked about this concept of development partners, these are early partners that joined us in this journey, and we're doing a fair amount of development around that. So that's caused some of it. And then some of that has been idiosyncratic to those same institutions in terms of things going on in their own operation that have delayed some of -- delayed some of the onboarding. So that's been a big part of it. The second thing that's been driving is been really around private markets. While we've continued to bring on clients, and we're really pleased with our offering and the clients that we brought on, [indiscernible] slowdown in private markets is actually affecting us because we start to get paid right when the fund starts to draw capital [indiscernible]. And if you've been following this, many of the new funds that have been raised, including some of the very, very largest ones actually haven't drawn capital. So we've got a quote set up and ready to go. But we're not actually deriving meaningful revenues from that yet. So that would be the other major factor that's going on here. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Ron, please continue. Ron O'Hanley: Well, thanks, everybody for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's discussion is being broadcasted live on State Street's website at investors.statestreet.com. This conference call is also being recorded for replay. State Street's conference call is copyrighted and all rights are reserved. This call may not be recorded for rebroadcast or distribution, in whole or in part, without the expressed written authorization from State Street Corporation. The only authorized broadcast of this call will be housed on the State Street website. Now, I would like to introduce Elizabeth Lynn, Global Head of Investor Relations at State Street. Elizabeth Lynn : Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Ron O'Hanley, will speak first, then, Eric Aboaf, our CFO, will take you through our third quarter 2024 earnings presentation, which is available for download on the Investor Relations section of our website, investors.statestreet.com. Afterward, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation will include results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our presentation. In addition, today's call will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those referenced in our discussion today and in the SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our views change. Now, let me turn it over to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results, which we released earlier this morning, demonstrate the accelerating financial performance and strong business momentum we are achieving this year, which in turn positions State Street well for future growth. We achieved robust fee and total revenue growth and generated positive fee and total operating leverage in 3Q, which, when combined with increased capital return quarter-on-quarter, drove strong earnings growth for our shareholders on both the year-over-year and sequential basis, with quarterly EPS reaching the highest on record. In addition to strong 3Q results, our year-to-date results also highlight the strength of our franchise and financial performance in three quarters of the way through the year, with solid fee and total revenue growth and good expense discipline driving better than expected positive fee and positive total operating leverage, as well as strong earnings growth relative to the same period in 2023 and excluding notable items. The operating environment in the third quarter was dynamic. While global equity and fixed income markets moved notably higher, the world's investors faced a number of risk-off events in 3Q, including fears of a U.S. recession, the unwinding of the carry trade, concerns over tech valuations and continued geopolitical tensions. These events drove bouts of negative market sentiment and significant market volatility. However, these market dislocations proved to be short lived with markets taking comfort from a host of subsequently dovish Central Bank pivots, including the first rate cut from the Federal Reserve in four years, as well as improved economic data in the U.S. We supported clients and navigated well through this market backdrop, delivering strong business and financial performance. We remain laser-focused on successfully executing against our key strategic priorities to drive better results, which I will now discuss. Turning to Slide 2 of our investor presentation, our third quarter EPS was $2.26 as compared to $1.25 in the year-ago period. Excluding notable items, we delivered strong earnings growth of 17% year-over-year with record quarterly EPS, while 3Q ROE was a strong 12%. Relative to the year-ago quarter and excluding notable items, fee and total revenue growth was robust at 7% and 9%, respectively, and in turn driving margin expansion. All areas of our business contributed to this year-over-year revenue growth and NII was significantly higher. Q3 servicing fees increased 3% year-over-year and we are pleased by the sales momentum we continue to see within the Investment Services business as we execute well against the sharpened strategy that we outlined last year. At the same time, expenses remained well-controlled despite increases in revenue-related costs. We continue to drive transformation and productivity savings, which are funding significant investments in our business this year. As a result, while 3Q expenses increased by 6% year-over-year, on a year-to-date basis, expenses increased by just 3%, excluding notable items relative to the same period in 2023. Turning to our business momentum, which you can see in the middle of the slide, we achieved a great deal in the third quarter. Our business performance indicators, including wins, clearly illustrate the effectiveness of our strategy and positioning State Street to support our clients, compete better and gain share. Within Investment Services, in 3Q, we generated strong AUC/A wins of $466 billion, with new servicing fee revenue wins of $84 million, the highest quarter this year. 3Q provided another clear demonstration of the power of State Street Alpha, which brings together the full depth and breadth of our servicing and software solutions. Alpha is a clear competitive advantage, which strategically positions us to retain business at even higher levels, win new long-term relationships, and, as evidenced this quarter, deepen existing relationships in a meaningful way. We reported two new Alpha mandates in 3Q, with Alpha accounting for the vast majority of our AUC/A wins this quarter, as State Street was awarded a significant mandate by a premier large global asset manager. This win illustrates the compelling value proposition of our front-to-back solution for clients. What started as a front-office Charles River client will now extend to include a host of middle- and back-office services, including custody, all underpinned by our Alpha Data Platform and Data Services. We are also very pleased with the momentum at Global Advisors this quarter. Our cash, ETF and institutional businesses all had positive net flows, including record quarterly flows in cash and strong ETF flows. In aggregate, quarterly total net flows of $100 billion and quarter-end assets under management of $4.7 trillion both reached record levels in 3Q. Importantly, we expanded our market share in a number of key product areas and geographies. For example, we improved our institutional money market fund rank this quarter, while Spider also gained share in both U.S. low cost and commodities, as well as in the EMEA region. We also continue to innovate and strategically expand Global Advisors' capabilities and client solutions. For example, Global Advisors launched 20 new ETFs in 3Q, including three actively-managed digital asset-focused ETFs. We also announced a new relationship with Apollo Global Management that will aim to expand investor access to private market opportunities. Turning to our Markets businesses, stronger client volumes in both FX trading services and securities finance helped to drive revenues higher, both sequentially and year-over-year. I was particularly pleased to see State Street named as a leader in the four categories by Euromoney Magazine in its 2024 FX Awards, including the world's Best FX Bank for Client Service as well as Research, which underscores the value clients place in our Markets franchise. Turning to our balance sheet, our year-over-year NII performance was strong, as a number of targeted management actions over the last year have helped to support NII growth. Our balance sheet is solid, enabling over $670 million of capital return in 3Q, including $450 million of share repurchases. As we look ahead, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders in the fourth quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors. Before I turn it over to Eric, we also announced this morning that Eric will be leaving State Street to pursue a new opportunity outside of banking. We have commenced a formal search process to identify his replacement, and Eric will stay on with us through mid-February to support us through this transition. I and the team have been fortunate to work closely with Eric over the last eight years. Personally, I have enjoyed and valued our partnership, and want to thank Eric for his leadership and wish him well in his new role. With that, let me hand the call over to Eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail. Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Ron. Before I get into the numbers, I want to say that it has been a privilege to have been here at State Street and to have worked with you and the team. I'm proud of all that we've accomplished together over the past eight years, and it's with mixed feelings that I'm moving on. But I know that the progress will continue and that State Street is well-positioned with a strong financial foundation and strategy for success. And I look forward to working with the team into 2025 during the transition. Now, let me walk everyone through our results for the third quarter. Starting on Slide 3, we reported record EPS of $2.26 for the third quarter, which included notable revenue items that, in aggregate, were neutral to earnings and are detailed on the right side of the page. You can see that we took the opportunity to do some additional repositioning of the investment portfolio this quarter, which I'll talk more about in a moment. We delivered robust EPS growth of 17% year-on-year, excluding notable items, reflecting broad-based fee growth, higher NII and continued capital return, which increased on a sequential quarter basis. Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half of the year, as healthy fee and total revenue growth coupled with expense discipline delivered both positive fee and positive total operating leverage, excluding notable items, in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. The quarter clearly demonstrates good margins and returns with pre-tax margin at almost 28.5% and ROE of 12% and a return on tangible common equity of over 19%. Turning now to Slide 4, the third quarter period-end AUC/A and AUM, again, increased to record levels, supported by both equity and bond market tailwinds as well as strong client flows. As you can see on the right panel of the slide, after an eventful third quarter, the various external indicators for our Markets businesses were mixed. That said, we were encouraged by the continued growth in client volumes and balances across our FX trading and securities finance businesses, which I'll discuss more in detail shortly. Turning to Slide 5, third quarter servicing fees increased 3% year-on-year, as higher average market levels and new business were partially offset by pricing headwinds and previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity, including an asset mix shift. The impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately 2 percentage points to year-on-year growth, while lower client activity, including an asset mix shift into cash, was a headwind of approximately 1 percentage point to year-on-year growth, which seems to be abating somewhat. We do feel good about servicing fee momentum going into the fourth quarter. Encouragingly, we generated $84 million of revenue wins in the quarter, the majority of which were driven by back-office mandates, in line with our strategic focus. Over the past four quarters, we've achieved nearly $330 million of servicing fee revenue wins. Moving to Slide 6, third quarter management fees increased 10% year-on-year, primarily reflecting higher average market levels as well as record quarterly net flows, with positive inflows across all three major product lines. We gained market share within our cash business due to strong investment performance and expanded distribution, as well as in ETFs where our strategic repricing initiative contributed to the strong flow performance and continued ETF market share gains. Taken together, our Investment Management business demonstrated strong growth in the quarter while also generating a healthy pre-tax margin of approximately 30%, up over 2 percentage points year-on-year. Importantly, as Ron mentioned earlier, we continue to position Global Advisors for success by further expanding its capabilities and client solutions and meeting the evolving needs of investors in key growth areas, such as digital assets, private markets and innovative fixed income solutions. Now, turning to Slide 7, as I noted, this quarter, we are pleased to see continued growth in our Markets businesses with higher volumes across nearly all of our FX venues relative to the year-ago period. FX trading revenue increased 15% year-on-year, excluding notable items, driven by higher client volumes with particular strength in emerging markets. Securities finance revenues increased 13% year-on-year, reflecting higher agency lending balances and share gains with excellent performance in prime services as we put more balance sheet to work to support our clients. Moving on to software and processing fees, revenues were up 11% year-on-year, mainly driven by higher front-office software and data revenues associated with CRD, which is described in greater detail on the following slide. Turning to Slide 8, our third quarter front-office software revenues increased 12% year-on-year with our software-enabled and professional services revenues up a strong 21%. We are pleased with the robust growth we've consistently delivered in our software business, with revenues up 10% year-to-date. This level of growth supports our belief that our software business has the potential to reach $1 billion of revenue over the next five years. And as Ron noted, we reported two additional Alpha mandate wins in the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving our goal of winning six to eight new Alpha clients this year. Moving to Slide 9, third quarter NII increased 16% year-on-year to $723 million as higher investment security yields and higher loan growth more than offset continued deposit rotation. On a sequential basis, NII was 2% lower, primarily driven by continued deposit rotation, as well as by the impact of lower short-end rates stemming from Central Bank actions. This dynamic was partially offset by higher investment security yields, as well as additional lending and sponsored repo activity. The market dynamics for the sponsored repo product were constructive in the quarter. As detailed on the right panel of this slide, average investment portfolio balances increased both sequentially and year-on-year. We also opportunistically repositioned a small portion of the book late in the quarter, which has a payback of approximately five quarters, benefiting NII over the next two years. Average deposits increased 14% year-on-year and 2% quarter-on-quarter, as we continue to realize the benefits of our client engagement efforts. As we move into 4Q, we'd expect to generally operate around these levels, albeit with a bit of continued noninterest-bearing deposit rotation. Turning to Slide 10, year-on-year, third quarter expense growth was 6%, primarily driven by higher performance base instead of compensation and revenue-related costs, which were worth about half of the increase, as well as important investments in products, technology and infrastructure. We remain acutely focused on managing our cost base, as demonstrated by year-on-year expense growth of just 3% on a year-to-date basis, excluding notable items. As Ron mentioned, in the third quarter, we continued to deliver productivity benefits through transformation of our operating model and other savings initiatives, achieving roughly $125 million of year-on-year savings for a variety of actions. Year-to-date, we delivered roughly $350 million of savings, and we're on track to achieve our productivity savings target of $500 million this year. We're continuing to benefit from our ongoing organizational simplification. Process improvements and automation initiative, which has enabled us to further improve service quality while also lowering our headcount on a pro forma basis, including the JV consolidation by 4% year-on-year as detailed on the bottom left of the slide. Moving to Slide 11, as you can see, our capital, leverage and liquidity levels all remain very strong. As of quarter-end, our standardized CET1 ratio of 11.6% increased from the prior quarter as capital generated from earnings combined with the benefit of lower rates on AOCI more than offset increased capital return and RWA growth as we supported our clients. As I just noted, we delivered on our goal to accelerate capital return in the third quarter with common share repurchases of $450 million, up from $200 million in the prior quarter and $100 million in Q1. But falling rate moves at the end of the quarter did create some unexpected excess capital. In total, we returned over $670 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, equivalent to a total payout ratio of almost 100%. As we look ahead, we are planning for another quarter of healthy capital return in Q4, which we would expect to be somewhat higher than this quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors. As such, we continue to expect the full-year payout ratio for 2024 to be comfortably in the 80% to 90% range as we aim to strike the right balance between our capital return goals and supporting our clients with our balance sheet. In summary, we're pleased with both our third quarter and year-to-date results, which continue to demonstrate our ability to execute against our strategy to drive sustainable business momentum while delivering positive fee and total operating leverage, excluding notable items, along with a significant return of capital to shareholders. With that, let me cover our improved full-year outlook, which is all on a year-on-year basis and ex notable basis. I would highlight that the outlook continues to have the potential for significant variability given the economic and political environment we're operating in. In terms of our current macro assumptions, we're assuming global equity markets are flat to third quarter end for the remainder of the year. Our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve, and we expect FX market volatility to remain relatively flat to third quarter average levels for the remainder of the year. Given our strong results year-to-date and higher average market levels, we now expect that total fee revenue will likely be at or slightly above the high end of our up 4% to 5% range, better than our prior expectations. Turning to NII, we now expect full-year NII will be up in the 4% to 5% range, which is also better than our previous guide for NII to be up slightly on a full-year basis. Finally, given these improved top-line revenue expectations, expenses are expected to be somewhat higher than our prior outlook and now up in the range of 3.5% this year, given higher revenue-related costs. Importantly, we continue to expect to deliver both positive fee and positive total operating leverage for the full year. And with that, let me hand the call back to Ron. Ron O'Hanley: Thank you, Eric. To conclude, I'm pleased with how we have been able to deliver stronger financial performance so far this year. We entered 2024 expecting roughly 3% to 4% fee revenue growth together with positive fee operating leverage, while NII was expected to be a headwind to our financial results on a full-year basis. However, with successful execution against our strategic and client engagement priorities, together with a more constructive operating environment and strong balance sheet management, we now expect to notably outperform our outlook relative to where we started the year with higher fee revenue growth and NII comfortably up year-over-year. As a result, we expect to deliver both healthy positive fee and total operating leverage this year, excluding notable items. We are positioned for a strong finish to 2024 and we are confident as we look into next year. Operator, we can now open the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. I appreciate all that detail. I like the NII guide, and what that, I think, implies for next year. Can you talk about the management actions taken? You mentioned the five-year -- the five-quarter payback. I want to be blunt and say, does that mean you'll make at least the $81 million of that cost over the next five quarters? And then maybe a little more color on what within the book you actually restructured and offloaded? Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it's Eric. You've interpreted that exactly correctly. The $80 million loss that was booked in the quarter will reverse out in the next -- within the next five quarters, and then, we'll have some, and it'll be a positive for the company. As we continue to manage the investment portfolio, we have north of $100 billion of assets. They range from treasuries, MBS securities to supranationals and foreign sovereigns. There were some securities that we felt were lower coupon that could be restructured or repositioned through a sale. We bought back some additional securities. In this particular set of actions, it was mostly in the treasury and international sovereign and supra space. It was $4 billion or $5 billion of securities on $100 billion book, so relatively modest. And it also allows us to just adjust the position of the book across the curve slightly, which was also beneficial. So, kind of, as I think you'd expect, but this will be helpful going forward and part of the management actions that we've been talking about as we manage NII. Some of those are around the investment portfolio, some of those are around lending growth, and some of those are around our engagement with clients on deposits as we've talked about in the past. Glenn Schorr : That's a nice parting gift. Thank you. Maybe one quick one. You mentioned in the SSGA conversation about the hybrid product with Apollo. I'm curious if you'd give us any bits in detail of how it will work and why you chose maybe 15% going to private credit. Is that enough to drive differentiated performance and scalability? Is this just like a toe in the water to see how this is going to be received? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah, Glenn, it's Ron. We're in a quiet period now with the SEC, so we're really constrained about what we can say about this. But what I will say is, we've been -- much of our innovation in the past has been about how do you democratize access to more sophisticated clients and put them in structures that are broadly available. And what we're talking about here is consistent with that. We'll have a lot more to say about it after the SEC has completed its process. Glenn Schorr : Okay, cool. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS Financial. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And Eric, congrats on the new role. Big change in the multiples. Hope that doesn't create issues, give you the bends or something when you go up. So, curious about -- with Eric's departure, kind of bring succession to mind. So Ron, could you maybe update us on the latest on that front and what you can tell us about the Board's plan? Ron O'Hanley: Are you referring to my succession, Brennan? Brennan Hawken : That's right. Yeah, overall. Ron O'Hanley: So, as you would expect, succession is something that well-managed and well-overseen companies talk about all the time. And there's a near constant discussion about this at the Board and there's a plan in place for when that time comes. Brennan Hawken : Okay, great. And then, repo has been pretty solid. Clearly, you guys see some continued strength, hence, the updated NII outlook for the year. But could you tell us about how repo comes into play there into your expectations? And what we should think about the recent strength there? Eric Aboaf : Glenn, it's Eric. The repo product is one of many that we offer for clients, right? We offer them cash on deposit in various forms. Money market sweep repo is a collateralized activity. So, in a way, think of it as one of the broad range of elements that we offer. What we found is as the Fed has trended down its reversed repo operation, there's been more repo activity in the market and we've obviously wanted to be there to help our clients. That said, the repo activity, the sponsored repo activity that we do is 10%, 11%, 12% of our NII typically. It will bounce around by 1 percentage point or 2 percentage point. This quarter, I called it out because I think we added about 1 percentage point of NII due to the increase in repo activity. And what you're working through is sometimes balances are up a bit, sometimes margins are up a bit, and we just found more activity in the market. There's more cash out there as you've seen. And there are also more borrowers who are looking for cash and have collateral to post. And those are markets where we're happy to serve our clients on both sides of that transaction and stepped in and stepped up for them. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Blostein : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks. Eric, congrats to you as well. I guess, in that vein and the question for both of you guys, State Street has made some pretty meaningful progress improving profitability recently, but with the new CFO search underway, how durable do you think these profitability improvements are likely to be? So, like, in other words, how much of this is already in motion and sort of on the rails that can more seamlessly perhaps transition to whoever comes next? And what are your ultimate sort of aspirations for pre-tax margins for the firm as a whole over time? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah, Alex, I'll start on that. I mean, we've been fairly transparent about what we've been doing across the board at the firm, both revenues and expenses. So, starting with our Investment Services business, I mean, we've talked a lot about what we've done to restore and regain and really distinguish ourselves in service quality, which in turn has enabled us to actually grow and restore the growth that we've had in the past. We talked a lot about some of the new sales and client service kinds of actions we have in place. That's all in motion. Is there more to do? For sure. But is the plan clear? Yes, it is. But we would expect to see continued benefits being derived from that. In GA, we've got a broad-based strategy and they're really aimed at how do we actually broaden the appeal and broaden the franchise beyond its traditional institutional core. We've talked a lot about what we've done in the retail area with the low-priced ETFs. Product innovation is occurring at a really breakneck clip there. We launched 20 new ETFs this year. We've talked about some of the new partnerships that we've had, which assuming we get through all the regulatory hurdles there, we're very optimistic about. And so, we feel like we've got that side covered in a pretty clear path. In the Markets business, the Markets client franchise largely overlaps with our Investment Services franchise, but that's not enough, right? You have to be able to distinguish yourself in there. And I think the progress that you're seeing over the past couple of quarters reflects some of the work that we've done there with more to come. I mean, this is a franchise that's based on innovation. And then finally, in terms of productivity, we've been talking to you about productivity and transformation since 2019. And every year, we go at it in a different way, typically a more sophisticated way each year. The early years are about what, I guess, we'd all describe as low-hanging fruit. These later years have been about fundamental operating model transformation, including a much more sophisticated application of technology. That's where a lot of our investment is going, but we see much more to do there. So, I wouldn't anticipate a new CFO signaling any kind of change in strategy. Now, it's not to say that it isn't a vitally important role and we're going to -- the search process is literally commencing today. We've already engaged a firm to help us. We'll look both inside and outside, but we're very confident coupled with the plan we have in place, four months of transition that we have with Eric, and just the overall performance of the firm that we're going to be in good shape through this transition. Eric Aboaf : Alex, I'd also add, our medium-term targets stand as stated. They are deeply embedded in our culture, in our senior executive and management teams and with our Board. And so, the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, pre-tax margin target of 30%, those are there for the medium term purposely and topics and areas that we continue to strive for and deliver on. Ron O'Hanley: And Alex, also, I'm glad Eric mentioned that. Also, it's part of our long-term incentives. It's the achievement, realization of those targets. Alex Blostein : Yeah, all makes sense. Just wanted to clarify that. So, for my follow-up, maybe quickly on NII, obviously, very nice update for the fourth quarter. Probably too early to talk about '25 with a lot of specificity. But as you sort of think about how the balance sheet is positioned, especially in the back of the recent securities repositioning you've talked about earlier today, how should we think about the sustainability and just durability of this kind of NII run rate over the next couple of quarters? I think, in the past, you talked about being a little more asset sensitive in Europe still, maybe a little bit more neutral in the U.S., but maybe help us with some broader framework of how to think about '25. Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Alex, it's Eric. As you say, it's still early. We're operating through deposit levels, interest-bearing, noninterest-bearing, our portfolio composition, quarter by quarter by quarter. And so, we don't have additional information really to share regarding next year other than what we've said before, right? We've said that we continue for this past quarter and into the fourth quarter, expect some modest or slight amount of deposit rotation. That's a headwind. We've got the investment portfolio rolling through, but some quarters you get a bigger, smaller benefit just depending on the exact bond. And then, you've got lending activity. And then, you've got repo, as we talked about earlier on the call, bouncing up and down. We've said that it's really in the next few quarters, and I've used that language purposely, that we expect to see the stabilization of NII and then some growth from that level, but it's hard to pin exactly which quarter. But I think what you can do is if you open up the lens over one-year, three-year, five-year period, you can see where we've come from. You can see the zone that we're operating in. And I'll define the zone not as 1 percentage point difference, but the kind of a zone as you'd expected in a colloquial sense. But we're -- I think we're in a nice zone generally. It's helpful for our margin. And while the next few quarters we'll see some movement, we also see some stability and some growth thereafter. Alex Blostein : Got you. All right. Well, I think we'll get you for one more quarter after that. So, I'm sure that will be another topic yet again. So, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. Ron O'Hanley: Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Eric, I'll miss you. Sorry to see you go. Good luck in the next role. And, I guess, my final question for you is just around how we should be thinking about the trajectory here of NII in an environment where maybe we get slower pace of cuts? Is that better for State Street? Eric Aboaf : Thank you, Betsy, for the question and for the thoughts. Yeah, I think, directionally, our balance sheet is relatively neutral. We have a slight asset sensitivity. And so, as rates come down, that has a slight impact to NII on a quarterly basis, but it's not dramatic. But given that direction or position, we'd have slightly better NII if rates didn't fall as quickly. I think our collective view here is rates will come down, but we've seen the market overshoot on the rate reductions. Our economists think that the terminal rate is likely to be subsequently higher than what it's been in the past. And so, I think, we're reasonably well positioned, and we'll absorb some of the central bank actions. And as we do that, we'll continue to build out our client lending activity, repo activity, our deposit engagement activity and so forth. And those will all contribute to stabilization of NII around this zone and then growth from there. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thanks so much. And then, Ron, one for you on -- I think, recently I saw a headline about State Street leaning into Mexico, and wanted to understand, is this a new effort or this is an expansion of existing business? And maybe just put it into context around your growth strategy, and are there other countries that you're looking to lean into? Thanks. Ron O'Hanley: Yeah, Betsy, so we have a -- we certainly have a presence in Latin America. It's smaller than EMEA and APAC for us. But as you would expect, we tend to -- this is on the servicing, little bit in the markets area, but it's on the -- it really rise out of services. And as countries develop and as investment markets develop, that's the opportunity for us. And so, we are building out at a, I would say, moderate pace our capabilities and activity in Latin America, and what you saw there really reflected that. Our core markets, as you could imagine, remain the U.S., EMEA and APAC, but as you've seen from our growth over the past couple of years, it's -- we've had lots of growth in EMEA and APAC. More recently, we've gotten the growth rate in the U.S. kind of back on what had been traditionally. But as these markets grow, they start to need the same kind of capabilities that we've got in those developed markets, and also, in many cases, you have so-called emerging or developing markets that are really skipping over some of the milestones that developed markets had done in their development. So, again, it's an opportunity to bring some advanced technology and those kinds of things. But it's a modest investment. And we would expect over the short term, modest growth, but it's important to get the foothold there. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great, thanks. Good afternoon. And congrats, Eric, also. Maybe just taking on a comment that you mentioned Eric about putting more of your balance sheet to work to support clients, can you just go into a little bit more detail in terms of which areas? I assume you mean on the asset side and lending. And then, in conjunction with that, maybe if you can talk about deposit pricing strategies with your asset servicing clients in terms of either deposit beta or also supporting your clients in terms of the revenue model? Eric Aboaf : Brian, sure. Let me cover those in -- one by one. On the asset side of the balance sheet, we've got a $300 billion balance sheet. We've got about $120 billion of risk-weighted assets. And as we think about capital deployment, it continues to be in three areas that we've historically supported our clients in, and we want to continue to expand. So, the first one is lending, as you mentioned. And we do everything from capital call financing to BDC lending, really an ecosystem of lending that we do for our private markets clients, our asset management clients and so forth. And there's real growth there for us, there's growth there for them. And what we find constructive is that, with many of those clients, if you support them with your balance sheet, they're that much more encouraged and likely to come to you for servicing activities, for asset management activities. And that's a very constructive and kind of virtuous circle of relationship that we and they benefit towards. So, lending is a very important part of what we do. Secondly, our trading activities in FX require a balance sheet. If we do more than just one, two, three month forwards and swaps, if we do options to support our clients, those require balance sheet. And again, we're happy to do that for our clients, especially for our substantial clients that we have large relationships with. And we'll do that around the world. So that's a good part. And then thirdly, it's really around the thirdly, it's really around the securities financing business, which has both an agency lending component where we're lending out of the box, but that requires some capital under the Basel III rules. And then, the prime services business, right, where we're lending out to those who are borrowers in the capital markets. And that's been an area of growth as well. So, those are the areas. The way we think about it is, we think of ourselves and we really act as relationship lenders, right? We lend not for itself, but we lend because it's to support our clients. It comes at good returns, but it comes as a way to deepen and broaden and expand the relationships that we have. So that's what we've been doing. We like to continue to do that. And the more we lend and support them across those different areas that I described, those three areas, the more growth we'll see both in NII and in the fee line. On the question of -- is that... Brian Bedell : Yeah, perfect. Actually, I can tie in the back half of that question with the second one, and that's just on the revenue -- on the fee revenue side of your new wins, particularly the Alpha products, I know -- the Alpha platform rather, and I know the private market initiatives as well. Should we be thinking of those as fee rate accretive or are you also flexible on pricing some of those with deposits as well on compensating balances? Eric Aboaf : I'd say it's a little bit of both, to be honest. We have, for example, in the servicing fee area, we booked $330 million of wins on a trailing 12-month basis. We continue to target $350 million to $400 million of fees. But it's obviously lumpy and a mandate sometimes pulls forward from a quarter, sometimes moves out a quarter. We'll see exactly where we land, but we are continuing to hone in on delivering substantial amounts of fee wins this year and have that target clearly in sight. As we do that, deposits are a part of the relationship, but more and more clients think of it both ways. They understand that there's a balance of trade. They understand that if they are pushing too much on one lever, then the other levers have to move in the opposite direction. On the other hand, there is real opportunity to work with clients to see how we can serve more and more of their needs. And what we found that as we've got that -- as we have those discussions, we end up doing more work with our clients and more support of our clients in more areas. And so, they tend to build and feed on each other as opposed to being offsetting. Brian Bedell : That's great color. Appreciate your detailed answers as always, Eric. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good afternoon. Hey, Eric, just on deposit behavior, after the rate cut, how did mix and volume growth look and pricing? Any thoughts on the initial reaction to the rate cuts in the deposit side? Eric Aboaf : Jim, it's Eric. We really just saw more of what we've been seeing over the last few months. I don't think we saw any discernible change. Deposits in the system are generally been trending up 1 point or 1.5 point a quarter. That's across the banking system. You've seen our results are a little more of that. And we didn't really see a lot of changes. We continue just to see a market environment where there's a fair amount of cash in the system. Part of that is positioning. Part of that is, I think, carefulness on our investors -- that our investors have given the political and economic uncertainty. And so, the cuts didn't have a discernible impact on deposit levels. And in general, we think we're going to operate in and or around this level for the time being. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just pivoting to servicing fees, still a significant backlog, yet to be installed business in asset servicing. So, can you discuss how you're -- how quickly you expect that new business to be onboarded and how you're thinking about the quarterly trajectory from here? Eric Aboaf : Yeah, the servicing backlog, we've enjoyed continuing to build. We, obviously, want to build it and deploy it, right? Both are important to our business system. And I think over time, it will continue to trend up somewhat and then get to a steady state level. Right now, as we look forward, we think about the installation of that backlog in two ways. On an AUC/A basis, we think about the installation coming in the next few years with somewhere between half to three-quarters of that coming through in the next year. And in terms of the servicing fee backlog itself, we roughly expect about half of that to come through over the course of the fourth quarter and all of next year, if you want to kind of rough it out and just think about the pace of installation. What that means is that we're always installing revenues from our backlog onto the balance sheet, right, or onto the -- into the P&L, I should say. And then, at the same time, our coverage and relationship force is out there winning new business. And there's business that then installs within three months, six months, nine months and 12 months. And so, over the -- every year, you'll see a mix. You'll see business that comes from a backlog that had a longer installation time period and then you'll have business that comes from within that fiscal year itself. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Appreciate the help. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Ron. Hi, Eric. Congratulations, Eric, on the new position. Ron, you mentioned about the new business wins in the quarter. And I think you said $466 billion in assets under custody/administration. Can you share with us how much of that came from existing clients where you grabbed the bigger wallet share from those clients versus new customers? And second, were the wins primarily in the U.S., or were they outside the United States, Europe or Asia? Ron O'Hanley: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Gerard. So, for this quarter, there was -- we had two Alpha wins, and the two Alpha wins dominate that AUC/A. It's just -- it's about $380 billion of the $460 billion is Alpha. And that's divided between U.S. and non-U.S., with a very, very significant global player in there that has a lot of U.S. presence. And what's interesting about both of them is -- both these wins is, they were existing, but in one case, we had a very, very modest service footprint with this institution. We were Charles River only with them. And as a result of this Alpha win, we will have a true front-to-back relationship with them, including importantly to move the asset servicing from a competitor to us. And with the asset -- excuse me, I'm sorry, moving the custody from a competitor to us. And with custody comes lots of opportunities to do things like deposits and foreign exchange and things like that. So -- and I think for years now as we've talked about the strategy and why this has been -- why we think it's important and why we think it gives us a competitive advantage. One of the reasons is just that, it's the opportunity to deepen relationships. And the other reason why it's so important is the flip side of taking long to install is that the business tends to be quite sticky because this is really -- it's much more analogous to enterprise outsourcing where the institution is actually making a choice of either, in most cases, moving from an insourced model to an outsourced model, and in some cases, moving from one outsourcer to another, but that doesn't happen quite as frequently. And as a result, because of the work that both parties are doing, we insist upon a longer contract period and the client itself understands these are very sophisticated buyers, understand that they're generational decision here, and so they want to get it right. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you for that color. And then, as a follow-up question, obviously, you guys are well-capitalized. You've been using your capital to support organic growth, as Eric pointed out, with lending, and you're paying obviously dividends and increasing them and buying back your stock. Alternatively, obviously, capital can be used for acquisitions. Can you give us an update on your appetite for acquisitions recognizing, of course, the Brown Brothers transaction did not work out the way you intended, but can you share with us your thoughts there as well? Ron O'Hanley: Well, Gerard, we think about M&A not as a strategy, but as a way to implement our strategy either more rapidly or more efficiently. So, we'll always be paying attention to opportunities like that, but we see a lot of promise in the organic plans that we have developed and are now seeing the fruits of. So, our last significant acquisition, as you know, was Charles River that was done for important strategic reasons to enable the creation of the Alpha front-to-back platform. It was a dilutive acquisition, we knew that at the time, but we felt it was a very important long-term investment, and it's proven to be, but that's also costly and oftentimes disappointing to shareholders. So, we take our stewardship of capital responsibility very seriously, and we like what we're able to do on an organic basis or building on what we've done. So, not to say, we'll never do these things, but it's a high bar and it's got to be about -- as I said at the beginning of this answer, it's got to be really about accelerating the strategy and/or realizing the strategy more efficiently than we could organically. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Ron O'Hanley for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Ron O'Hanley: Thanks to all for joining us on the call. And just to emphasize, you get one more quarter of Eric. So, he'll be with us for the fourth quarter report in February and, basically, with us through mid-February -- in January and, basically, with us through mid-February. So, thank you all. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Before we begin the Q&A session of our fourth quarter earnings call, I would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused by the technology issue related to a vendor that we experienced on Friday, which prevented us from completing the Q&A portion of our earnings call last week and we appreciate you taking the time to join us again today. With me on the call are State Street's Chief Executive Officer, Ron O'Hanley; Chief Financial Officer, Eric Aboaf; and EVP and Investment Services CFO and incoming Interim CFO, Mark Keating. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's call will reference results presented on a basis that excludes or adjusts one or more items from GAAP. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP or regulatory measure are available in the appendix to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings presentation from Friday's call, which is available on our website, investors.statestreet.com. In addition, today's call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those statements due to a variety of important factors, such as those referenced in our discussion today and in our SEC filings, including the Risk Factors section in our Form 10-K. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of today, and we disclaim any obligation to update them even if our view should change. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for hosting the second round. Just maybe digging into the puts and takes on the NII guide, understand the asset sensitivity to non-US. I think, 100 basis point downward shift in your Q is $260 million, but you had a $10 billion maturities in the HTM book and a pickup of 200 to 250 basis points there almost offsets that asset sensitivity. So outside of that, is it real and you had deposit growth that was 15% heading into the year? So is it really just about the growth and mix of deposits and maybe a little bit of loan growth from here that will dictate up or down? Mark Keating : Hey, Jim, it's Mark Keating here. Thanks for the question. I'll start with that. I think it would be good maybe just to take the NII topic from a few different angles. It's -- I want to try to give you a bit of a comprehensive overview of how we think about our NII guide. And there's really four items I want to cover pretty quickly. Two are headwinds, which would be things like deposit mix and levels and the rate environment and a couple would be things we would consider a tailwind. You mentioned loan growth, for example, the investment portfolio rollover. So I thought I would just cover those and give you some context for how we're thinking about the outlook. So, first, on the deposit levels and mix. As we've talked about on the call, Friday, deposits did finish strong for the year in 2024 and a strong finish in Q4 specifically. Noninterest-bearing was up about -- was up in Q4, but that was after three quarters of sequential kind of decrease, and we saw the same pattern in Q4 2023. So there was a seasonality through the end of the year. So we do expect to see some leveling off as we come out of Q4 into Q1 this year. Overall, we expect deposits to remain elevated in the [$230 million to $240 million] (ph) range with some ups and downs, for example, noninterest-bearing while up in Q4. Year-over-year, it was down about 12% or about $3 billion. And we've talked before about expecting noninterest-bearing to continue to trend a bit lower and somewhere in the range of $20 billion to $25 billion is the range that we think of. Secondly, around the impact of rate cuts, as we've laid out our outlook was based on the rate curve at the end of the year, which was two rate cuts in the US, five at the ECB, three at the Bank of England. And as rate curves have moved around, I would just note that, so far, the reduction in the number of cuts looks mostly to be back-loaded at the end of this year. So we don't see much of a change there in our assumption. I'd also remind you that as you mentioned, we are asset sensitive, particularly in non-US currencies. We're pretty neutral around US rate changes. We are more sensitive to non-US rates and a cut in either euro or sterling is roughly $5 million to $10 million per cut per quarter for us. So that can be meaningful as well. Turning to kind of more of the tailwinds that we see, we do expect our loan growth to continue. It was about 14% in 2024. We have a similar expectation. It's something that we're doing really well with our clients on and supporting them, specifically our private markets clients. So we continue to see that to be a growth area. And then lastly, finally, I would say on the portfolio rollovers, we have discussed in other forums that we see roughly $4 billion per quarter, but that can be lumpy depending on maturities. I'd keep in mind also that we have had a couple of portfolio repositionings as recently as last third quarter. And currently, the pickup from rollovers is roughly 100 to 150 basis points. So hopefully, laying all that out and giving you a sense of how we balance out the puts and takes and the headwinds and tailwinds gives you a sense of why we think that we have a realistic and appropriately conservative outlook. But those are the variables, and we look forward to updating the group here as we move through the year. Jim Mitchell : No, that's really helpful and makes a lot of sense. Just on the deposit, I guess, expectation, it's pretty flattish, I guess, with fourth quarter levels. Is that the sort of uncertainty and seasonality, potentially any sense of how deposits have acted in January, I guess, as a help. Mark Keating : I think it's still pretty early. Again, we're a couple of weeks into the year. There's always a trend kind of coming out of the high point at the end of the year. So I think it's still pretty early to say. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you talk about what you view as your core organic revenue growth rate in the fee businesses. And I guess, I know we talked after your call, but you have 100 basis point headwinds from the BlackRock roll off, you have 100 basis point headwind from the currency. So, what do you see as a core growth rate exiting those factors out for '25 and what do you think the long-term growth rate is? And do you think that growth rate should keep up with the pace of growth in capital markets, which seem to have exceeded what you guys have done? Thanks. Mark Keating : Mike, hey, it's Mark. I can take that as well. Let me start with our fee-based business, and I can talk about servicing fees maybe first. And I think we talked a little bit about this on Friday, but may be helpful to give a sense of kind of how we see organic growth and how we think about the engine and kind of how we continue to drive sustainable growth in the fee business. And I'll take, again, investment services as a good example, but it applies also to our asset management business. And I think the first thing I'd like to take everybody through again is that let's think about where we've come from because this really is a multiyear journey around kind of underpinning our servicing fee business. About 1.5 years ago, we came together and laid out a plan on how we're going to power sustainable growth in our servicing fee business. And at the time, we knew that we needed to perform better. Our nearing history then was around servicing fee sales of roughly $150 million in 2019 and 2020. Then we started stepping that up to $250 million to $260 million and that was in 2021, 2022. At that point, then we set a target for ourselves of $350 million to $400 million, which is the range now we talk about for 2024 and similar range for 2025. So, in 2023, we did $300 million. And in '24, as we announced last week, we did about $380 million. And again, important to note that about 85% of that was back office and back office is important as we talk about because it brings a lot of other things along with it. It's a multiplier that brings NII, brings foreign exchange, trading, sec lending, lots of other cross-sell opportunities. So if you stand back and look at the, what we said we're going to do and what we've delivered around servicing fee growth, sales are up 45% since 2022, about 250% since 2020. And we did that by restructuring our sales team, realigning incentives, focusing on service excellence, as Ron has talked about many times. And then importantly, we've been investing in our products and services, features and functionality, all driven by a sustained high level of productivity. So we expect that range of sales will be the target that we will continue to achieve. And the team knows that, that is the level of sales and servicing fees that we need in order to make the business move forward organically when you think about things we've talked about around attrition and fee compression. One last thing I'd say is that another way to think about growth is really to talk about the revenue install backlog, which as we disclosed, it was about $350 million at the end of last year. Just for comparison, that was $200 million at the end of Q3 2023. So that's up about 75%. So again, there's lots more work to do. Those are the targets, and we've put a plan in place. We've measured that. We've reported on it. We are achieving what we said we're going to deliver, and we just need to be consistent and keep going on it. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Mike, it's Ron -- Mike, let me just add to that a little bit, and I know you probably have another question. A couple of things. We've talked for a while that why servicing fees won't necessarily track markets or capital markets. But the way to think about some of the other things is, and this is what we reported for '24. And we are expecting similar kinds of double-digit growth rates in places like software and global advisors. So, the way to think about the guide that we've given you, what we said was a 3% to 5% guide. That's -- the real guide, if you will, is 5% to 7%. And then what you take off from that is you've got 1% left over from our previously disclosed client. And then you've got some FX headwind there that takes it down to the 3% to 5% for 2025. That's the way to think about it. Mike Mayo : Okay. And what do you think about a long-term growth rate for core fee growth? And where do you stand within that? And what do you think for the next four or five years? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Well, it's hard to look out, Mike, for four to five years. But if you think about some of the changes that are driving our revenue growth, there's a couple of them. One was all the work that we put into the value proposition, particularly around Alpha, right? And that's just getting better and better. We're installing more from that. We continue to find very, very broad acceptance in the marketplace for, we can be discriminating in terms of who we're going after in that. So that would be a tailwind. Secondly, we've talked a lot about service quality and service quality really does set the stage for both business retention and your ability to grow business, particularly from your existing clients. We've worked very hard at that through technology and real service quality improvements. It\u2019s showing up in all of our customer satisfaction. So that would be the second. And then the third is what Mark talked about, and we talked to you about it now since almost continuously since late '22 into early -- into '23, we have overhauled the sales force. And it's not that we had bad people, but if you think about the pivot that we've made from just selling stuff, like back office services to pivoting towards an enterprise outsourcer, which is what we are with Alpha and what that means for how do you sell and how do you service and we're largely through that, which is why you've seen the kind of dramatic sales growth that we've had new business revenue growth. So it's a long-winded way of saying that all things being equal in terms of the market environment, we think this kind of growth rate that we're describing. So gross at 5% to 7%, net at 3% to 5% is actually something that we can sustain. Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Maybe a quick one first. In Prime Services, you talked about $2 billion increase in RWA to support clients. I'm curious the size and scope of what you do or don't do in prime services that might be redemption facilities or capital commitment lines for the private markets, but just curious if you could expand on that. Eric Aboaf : Yeah, Glenn, it's Eric. Let me take that. Prime services or prime brokerage is an integral part of what we've built over the last say, seven, eight, nine, 10 years. And what we've done over the last few years is really worked with clients to find the right way to deploy capital and to do it in a Basel III friendly manner, but also in a client-friendly manner. So it's an important part of what we do. You can see our securities finance revenues, which for the year are close to $450 million, a solid third, almost half of that is prime services. And it's really a way that we help support our clients. And it's hedge funds clients, it's the multi-manager client who also have hedge funds within their umbrella. And for us, it's a way as we support those clients and offer them capital, which they cherish and they value. They often bring to us more servicing fees, more FX trading, more thick repo, more depository business. And so it's really become an integral part of what we're doing and one that has a real substantial amount of growth and growth to it as well given the demands out there at clients have the needs they have and our ability in a capital-light business to put an extra couple of billion and draw up what turns out to be very strong double-digit teen growth this past year. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Cool. I appreciate that. Maybe one more in SSGA, I think quote was we continue to innovate and broaden our product suite and distribution capabilities. I mean your organic growth has definitely inflected the last handful of quarters. I wonder if you can talk about what's driving the rejuvenation at SSGA and how sustainable this better level of organic growth is? Thank you. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, Glenn, it's Ron. There's a few things that are driving that. Some of them have been long-term changes that were -- are gaining traction for us. As you know, we were for many years, primarily an institutional player and even our ETF business was oriented towards institutions. So we had launched the low-cost line and have made some fee adjustments in that. So we've got a set of low-cost funds that are priced very well for the -- what is the retail intermediary market, and we continue to gain share there. Secondly, on product development, we just picked up the pace of product development. So last year, SSGA will have lost about six -- we have launched about 60 different products, most of them ETFs. And again, we're swarming the field, if you will, with that, but it's both US and non-US and that's paying off. We continue to gain share in places like EMEA, where the ETF market is growing quite rapidly. And then finally, we've changed out a lot of people, or I should say, added people. We've got this deep expertise in institutional. We've added a lot of really good people on the retail intermediary. So that's been one of the primary drivers of what we do. And then we continue to pick our sub-advisory partners very well. We don't run a funds network. We work with really talented firms that do things that we don't. We've got some long history of that, for example, with the Bank loan bond and Blackstone and more recent history with some of the things that we've announced that are still in SEC approval. So all those things coming together, we think of -- certainly, we'd point to when we say where is this performance coming from, but more importantly, positioning us for that continued kind of growth in the future. Operator : Thank you, Glenn. Our next question will come from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, folks. Maybe just circling back on NII. Just to back into the -- on the deposit side, I guess what is the interest of doing any sort of more aggressive deposit raising? How do you think about that? And I guess that would be through pricing or other initiatives with the servicing client base to expand that base of deposits. So I guess what's the chance we could see upside from that -- the mid-30s number. Mark Keating : Hey, Brian, it's Mark. I can take that. Thanks for the question. I think over the recent history, we've shown a very strong capability in engaging with our clients around deposits. And I think it's across the balance sheet, not just deposits but speaking of deposits. So I mean, it is something that we are always looking at with our clients. I think we have some of that built into our outlook today. I mean again, I mentioned that there's some ups and downs. So you can kind of assume that there is some expansion of some of those initiatives that we have with our clients. So I think -- it's something we're certainly always -- we've built that muscle over the last few years, and it's something that we're always working with our clients on in terms of what their cash needs are. Brian Bedell : Okay. Great. And then my follow-up question is on asset management. It's a two-parter. One is just the fourth quarter beat our expectations. And I think the fee rate was higher, just not sure if there was any one-off in that? And is that a good jumping off point for I think what you said is double-digit, your expectation of double-digit fee growth in SSGA. And then a longer-term question attached to that. Ron, you've had a really long history of experience in the asset management industry. What's your view of 401(k) plans, potentially adopting alternative products? Would you be positioned to offer those? Obviously, it's a -- it's something that's been very compelling, but there's a lot of sort of roadblocks in terms of litigation and things. And I guess, what's your perspective of that changing? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Let me start with the first, and Mark, if I missed something, certainly add it in. But on the first, SSGA had a very good year. Obviously, they're much more market sensitive than the servicing business. So there is a, if you will, a direct element to that. But you saw the -- when you saw the net asset growth in there and all the organic growth. And again, for a lot of the reasons that I described earlier, we do think that the fourth quarter is a good jumping a point from there. Mark, I don't know if there's anything you want to add on that. Mark Keating : I think you got it. Ron O\u2019Hanley: On the broader point, Brian, it's interesting that you're saying this because the DC business, which I did mention in my prior answer, is also very important to us. We're one of the largest DC investment-only players. It's been really driven by innovation plus very good selling into plans. But one of the innovations that we were able to get through with the Department of Labor was we were the first to put, for example, annuities into target date funds. And we've got clients in that. We launched a broader product, and that's attractive. And it's something that really solves a problem for 401(K) investors, and then it gives them some longevity protection. There's been a lot of talk for a lot of years on why shouldn't DC investors be able to earn an illiquidity premium because they've proven to be the most durable of long-term investors and you alluded to it. The plaintiff\u2019s bar has successfully made that almost impossible on trustees are basically making their choices less on performance and much more around kind of a piece. We'll see with the new administration on that. It's hard to see what you describe happening. But to the extent to which the Department of Labor provided a safe harbor rule, it basically made the standard on what is after fee performance. And if that were to become the standard, then I think that would open the doors. But unless there's some kind of safe harbor, I don't see a lot of untrustees stepping up to that. Brian Bedell : Yeah. That\u2019s great perspective. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Thanks. And thanks for taking the question. I'd like to drill down to the loan growth that you said embedded in your outlook, 14% last year, similar rate here in 2025. It's a rather punchy level of loan growth. So could you speak to the types of loans that you are adding, the efforts involved. You said it was about expanding the client relationship. So maybe pulling back and thinking about how these loans are connected to expanding relationships and how you go through the risk parameters around adding new loans at this pace? Thanks. Eric Aboaf : Sure, Brennan, it's Eric. Let me just describe the loan growth. 2024 is a good example year. It continues the strength we had out of the year before and for shadows, the kind of lending we do. So roughly two-thirds or more of our loans are really clear towards alternative and private market clients. There is also a series of loans that we provide insurance companies, asset managers, as backup clients and so forth. But the growth is driven around private markets. That is, first, an area that we think is -- we can serve particularly well. We know the clients. We know their end users, a good part of the loans are cap call financing. So it's -- the recourse is strong to their underlying institutional investors. We also do BDC lending. We know the underlying assets in those funds. We help seed or support the expansion of CLOs. Again -- and we'll often do the servicing for those BDCs and those CLOs or the funds for the capital bolt on. So in a way, it's an ecosystem that we're quite comfortable with on one hand, because we're so familiar with it. It's one that is quite benign from a risk standpoint, that we're always vigilant and I say benign because we understand it so well and we seek out the -- a high standard of credit and assurance. And then it's an area of lending that is incredibly valuable to those private markets firms as a way to support the -- our growth in that business. And in my prepared remarks, I said we had had about 15% private market servicing fee growth and a good way for us to help drive that and encourage that is to be there for our clients. And what we found is our clients really value it, not only the individuals across those firms, but all the way up to the C-suite. And the more private markets as part of the array of just about every asset manager, not just the alternative providers, it just becomes an important part of the, I'll describe, as the balance of trade and the balance of the relationship that we see as particularly strong and particularly renumerative for both us and for them. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that, Eric. And we touched on this last week, but I don't think it was broadly broadcast. So I wanted to circle back to it. The deposit betas here recently, so the euro and the sterling, the pound sterling looked a little bit lower than what you guys normally talk about in your expectations. Could you speak to what might have caused that? And then how should we think about the betas by currency going forward? Eric Aboaf : Sure. Let me take that again, Brennan. And we've put out good disclosure here on our deposit betas. You could see it at a very high level on the average balance sheet where it's done on a -- I'll call it, a general basis. But in particular, we've got additional information in our addendum where we actually describe it by currencies. What we've described is that our betas will generally be symmetric on the way down for rates as they were on the way up by deposit segment. So we have a market index deposits, we have administered rate deposits, and we have deposit types in between. What we found so far is within our expectations that across the deposit base, and I think the US dollar was the easiest one to see, and it's the largest single group. So the law of large numbers helped to see the trend. We had 60%, 65% of betas over the course of this past quarter and it\u2019s something that we expect to be representative across the deposit stack. Euro and sterling has bounced around. Now, those deposit levels in those areas are anywhere between [GBP11 billion and EUR30 billion and change] (ph). So if a new client comes in, a client shifts their currency makeup, you'll have some other elements coming through that affects the averaging in the deposit yields and thus the betas or what I might say would be the immediate calculation. But I think the dollar one is representative and something that we'd expect in general in the seasoning cycle and the dollar betas that we saw, the 60%, 65% is something we'd expect and have seen if you look deep into the data, in euros and sterling. It just gets in those other currencies, it gets overshadowed by mix and volume changes in any particular quarter. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks for the color. Eric Aboaf : Sure. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, and good afternoon, folks. Ron, in your comments the other day when you guys went over the results, you mentioned that you have invested in technology to improve your service quality, can you share with us how has AI, artificial intelligence, played a role in this improvement? And then just overall, can you share with us your thoughts about how important it is for you guys to be embracing AI? And then second to that, when will we, as outsiders, really be able to measure the companies that are having real success with AI. Ron O\u2019Hanley: So, Gerard, so technology, as you know, has been -- has always been a really important part of our offering. It's what's distinguish State Street really from the earliest of days. And if you think about prior generation AI machine learning, that is a technology that we employ deeply and broadly around the organization, and you can actually see it very much. I use the example of fund accounting which if you go way back in the day, you used to remember, you used to measure that operation by a number of accountants per fund. And then we all got better at it, and then it was a number of funds per fund account and through the use of machine learning, a couple of things have happened in markets like developed market equities, there are no fund accountants. Machine learning is actually calculating now with every single transaction at the end of the day, at the end of the close of market. There's a human being that steps in, looks at very quickly the transactions, looks at exceptions that have been flagged by the machine that this is an out-of-bounds kinds of things makes judgments if they have to make some adjustments. And rather than taking 1.5 hours to get it out the door, it's probably done in under 15 minutes. And that kind of machine learning is being replicated throughout our operation. AI, I think we're all still early on this. Part of this is how you work with the large language models and client data and not -- and to ensure that the client data, particularly data that should be kept private isn't leaking into the large language models. So we've got a lot of tests on this. We do not have any broad-based deployment of it yet, but it will come, and it will come pretty rapidly. The areas that we see it in, probably first and foremost, will be in what we call -- what I call client service, not capital C -- capitalized client service, but routine client service goals, the kinds of things that often happen at the beginning of the day. They are routine because while it may be the first time that this client has seen it, it's happened in other places, things like cash availability. I think the AI-powered, call it what you want, chat bot will be something that will power that. And by the way, that technology and that approach has other uses. One area that we're working on deploying and probably will get deployed this year is how we think about it for HR inquiries coming from employees. That has the advantages that we can keep all that data within our walls, but the technology around that and the technology around how you would do a client service chatbot would be similar. So we fully expect this to be happening and the technology is getting better and better and particularly, as you can now use AI, and you probably all have done it, or have seen it, used where you're actually not just providing the answer, but providing the source document of the answer and that within that source document, highlighting where that comes from. The ability to trust this for the kinds of things that I'm talking about is getting higher and higher. Lastly, what I would say is the way we think about it because we've been talking to you and other investors for years now about transformation. And increasingly now and even the way Mostapha is running the transformation going on. He calls a transformation and AI because much of the kinds of next-gen transformation that we'll see over the next two, three, four, five years will be powered in some form by AI. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and very thoughtful. Thank you for the response. And just as a follow-up, possibly to Eric, coming back to the loan portfolio, and certainly, it's not very large relative to the total assets. We all understand that. How large are you guys willing to allow the portfolio to grow to it relative to either capital or assets? And then at what point do you think giving investors better detail in the portfolio in your public disclosures would be helpful. Thank you. Eric Aboaf : Gerard, it's Eric. We've been comfortable with this double-digit teen growth of the lending portfolio for a number of years now, and you've seen us either high single-digits or low to mid double-digits. And that's just become part of our business model. And so we don't see any immediate limits. We look around at other trust and custody banks and some of them have larger lending books as a percentage of assets. And so we think from a peer standpoint, a market acceptance standpoint, from an investor standpoint, to be honest, that there is -- we're such a capital-light model that we could comfortably afford to continue the growth in our lending book while still returning very substantial amounts of capital like we did this year to investors. And so it's become more and more, I would say, a relationship-based lending portfolio and one that is integral to our private markets plans -- our private market success and then our broader support of vast managers, insurers and even corporates. So it will be, I think, something that\u2019s -- in which we'll see sustained growth. I think in terms of disclosure, we're certainly open. And if you've got some thoughts, please share with them, share them with our IR team. we could certainly do a more different breakdown to may be delighted to get your and others input on that and share with you some more of the texture there over time. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you, Eric, and good luck in your new position. Ron O\u2019Hanley: Gerard, I just want to add one thing on this. Remember, this is highly focused on the growth of our private markets business. And remember, we talked about double-digit growth there. That's what we've been experiencing. So it's -- as that business grows, the lending opportunities available to us grow, we're not going to lead with lending. But as we grow the servicing and the administration and there's a lending opportunity that's consistent with our appetite and passes through our underwriting standards, we're going to be willing to do it. Now trees don't grow to the sky. So we're not giving you a 10-year forecast. But certainly, as we look out over the next couple three years, we see this as being able to be sustained based on how we see the growth of our privates business. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you, Ron. Operator : Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I want to ask about buybacks. Given that your Tier 1 leverage ratio was actually a smidgen below the low end of your range, what -- and your comments about wanting to grow loan -- need to grow that sharply. What -- can you talk a little bit about what impact that might -- what should be the outlook for buybacks? And how long are you willing to stay at the low end of the Tier 1 leverage ratio, especially given that the tenure has actually gone up since year-end. So that would put a little bit more pressure on the OCI. So what's your thinking there? Ron O\u2019Hanley: Yeah, Vivek, it's Ron. Let me start there, and then I'll ask Eric to step in. But just to be clear, we stand by what we have been saying now for a couple of years that our intention is to return 80% of our earnings to investors. And we absolutely see the path to continue to do that, and we're committed to that. So that's what you should expect here. Now you're right, you've identified what is the finding constraint there. And we certainly, that's something that we need to manage to. But even knowing that we need to manage to that, we're very much standing by the 80% target. Eric Aboaf : Vivek, it\u2019s Eric. And I\u2019d just add that CET1 has been our dominant binding constraint for many, many years and over a long series of quarters. Occasionally, Tier 1 leverage will move around and lined up this quarter as the balance sheet grows and we support more clients. And so we've just been, I think, careful and diligent about as needed, supplementing Tier 1 leverage with some preferred equity and doing that in a judicious way. But if you think about our capital ratio, CET1 is the dominant one in risk-based, it's risk sensitive. We've said for the time being, just given the external economic and geopolitical environment, we operate towards the upper end of our CET1 range. We've not said the same thing about Tier 1 leverage. Tier 1 leverage is really just a function of the size of the balance sheet. And ironically, as we get more deposits and more clients trust us, it floats down a bit, but that's manageable and something we'll just work with team in the course of business. But we're comfortable with our leverage ratio and the general zone that it's been running over the last couple of quarters. Vivek Juneja : Completely different question, if I may. You talked about in the presentation deck about winning a large business from an APAC lender. Could you talk a little bit about the fee rate on that kind of business. Is it more akin to US type? Is it lower than what you've seen historically in the Asian when we look at your fees on the business wins and the AUCA on the business wins? It seems to imply that. Any color on that? Mark Keating : Hi, Vivek, it's Mark Keating. Thanks for the question. Yeah. So I think when we talk about the APAC asset owner client deal that we signed in Q4, it's a good question because I think we framed that as a multiregional type of deal. So it's a business -- it's a client that has products and we'll be servicing in multiple regions. So whether it's in Europe, in a place like Luxembourg, for example, or in the US. So you shouldn't take the APAC as being the parent as being specific to kind of the APAC business in terms of pricing. I think sometimes people want to take the assets and divide it by perceived revenues. So, I think, hopefully, that helps in terms of -- it's a multi regional deal that has pricing very consistent in what we're seeing in these different jurisdictions. Vivek Juneja : Great. Thank you, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Smith with Truist. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David Smith : Hi, good afternoon. Alpha was responsible for about half of the AUCA wins this year. Can you share how much of the overall total business on the platform right now is on Alpha? And if there's any range or target you think will be on Alpha in the medium term? And how would you compare the benefits of getting clients on Alpha? Is it more in terms of increased retention, stronger pricing power, like, how do you weigh those different impacts? Ron O\u2019Hanley: David, I'll start this and then turn it over to Mark. So, we've always viewed Alpha as being a way to not just substantially improve our value proposition, but to put one out there that was distinctive from our competitors to be able to offer a front-to-back open architecture interoperable platform that, in some cases, we do everything front to back. In other cases, we're working either with other vendors that the client wants or with in-house kinds of activities or capabilities that they have, number one. Number two, we've always viewed it as we're solving some quite serious problems for our clients, oftentimes it's a tech stack or an operation stack that are really easy either not in for purpose any longer, is dated. But for us to be willing to step up to it, we want the servicing business, too. And then thirdly, what's advantageous about it is there's a lot of work to set these up. So we insist on and are able to capture much longer contracts that are seven-plus years as opposed to the typical three years. So that's the way we think about it. We've got now -- and Mark, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's 35 kind of announced clients and roughly 25 that are installed. Is that -- do I have that right? Mark Keating : That's correct. Yeah. And maybe I'd just maybe add on the end of that, that we have -- we did seven mandates in 2024, and we're comfortable in the same range in 2025, six to eight. But I think beyond just the number of mandates, I think as Ron said, and there's a couple of other things maybe I'd just add at the end, which is that the kind of what's next here is aligning it ever more to our core business pieces in the asset servicing side and what we're focused on there a lot is around how do we look at product enhancements within what we're doing today? How do we manage the talent around onboarding. As Ron said, these can be quite complex conversions. And then always looking to standardize and enhance the tools for integration. If you think about any time, you kind of create a marketplace, so you create ecosystem like we have with Alpha, you learn a lot along the way. And that's kind of first generation. And as you start to do more mandates, you start to standardize, enhance the tools for integration and you kind of leverage what you've learned, and I think that's what we're entering into now. David Smith : Thank you. And then separately on deposits. You talked about 60-ish percent in the fourth quarter for US deposits being pretty representative. Can you help us unpack what's underlying there and why it might be lower than the 75%, 80% beta you saw in the US on the way up? Eric Aboaf : Sure, David. It's Eric. We saw, I think, at the very beginning of the rate cycle, the betas, betas that were quite low and then they steepened over time. They got to that 60 -- and I can use a broad range, 65%, 70%, 75% quarter-by-quarter. But it literally dependent on individual quarters, individual pricing changes, specific mix of deposits. And so I wouldn't -- I think we're in the same general zone as we've begun to see the beta changes. As I said, US dollars was in that 65% this past quarter. Euros was also quite high around 65%. It's just British pound sterling just because it's a small pool. So the difference between 60% and 75% is usually an artifact of mix, individual client moves and so forth. But I think we're seeing something quite similar. Our deposit mix is always shifting some from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. But I think we're in the same general zone and one where we're going to -- we continue to be disciplined and thoughtful about our pricing. At the same time, we want to build our deposit franchise. And you saw that again this quarter, not withstanding those pricing adjustments and the betas we had in the fourth quarter, we had another quarter of deposit growth. And that just demonstrates the strength of our proposition, the strength of our relationship and the ability we have, as mark described, to secure deposits that -- at appropriately healthy margins.

Please feel free to reach out to IR with any additional questions. Thank you, and have a good day.",
