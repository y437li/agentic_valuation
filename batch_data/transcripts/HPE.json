Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've now completed our first full quarter as an independent company, and we're off to a very strong start. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused and agile company across a number of fronts. Our customers and partners understand our strategy and appreciate working with a simplified, faster-moving organization. Our employees are engaged and aligned. For example, we've created a single pan-HPE sales training and account planning program, which has already uncovered over 100 accounts where there are significant untapped cross-selling opportunities. Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including Servers, Cloud, high-performance computing, IoT, all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems. For our shareholders, this focus is driving strong financial and operational performance. In Q1, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency with revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. And when you exclude the impact from recent M&A activities, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis in every one of our business segments for the first time since Q4 fiscal year 2010. At the same time, we continued to make progress on our cost structure, particularly in ES, and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41, at the top end of our previously provided range. Delivering strong cash flow is also a key priority for us. While Q1 was impacted by seasonality, separation payments and timing, we expect cash flow to improve as we move through the year, and remain confident in our full year free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. Tim will walk through the specific Q1 cash flow drivers in a minute. Finally, in line with our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, in Q1 we paid $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion for share repurchases and nearly $100 million in dividends. As a result, we've already exceeded our FY 2016 commitment of returning at least 50% of expected free cash flow to shareholders. And share repurchases will remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders, given the current market conditions. Overall, while there is more work to do to accelerate top-line growth, align our cost structure and drive even closer collaboration and integration across our organization, I'm very pleased with where we stand today. Now let me turn to business performance. We had another strong quarter in Enterprise Group, with revenue up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. Our portfolio is truly the best we've had in years and is driving strong customer traction. For example, today HPE is the leading infrastructure provider for SAP HANA with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor. And this quarter we won a number of important deals, including one with the Canadian communications company, Rogers, to help them transform their existing traditional IT to a hybrid infrastructure. We will provide a comprehensive solution, including converged systems, cloud systems, StoreOnce, 3PAR all-flash and technology services. We also signed a multi-year agreement with one of the world's largest food producers, JBS, to help them build an IT environment that supports faster business expansion, including consolidating their data centers and moving to the cloud. And just last week, at Mobile World Congress, we announced that Swisscom, Switzerland's leading telecommunications provider, will deploy new virtual network functions using HPE OpenNFV solutions. This customer momentum is driving financial results, and each of our hardware business units performed well in Q1. In Servers, we delivered 5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, maintained strong margins, and also continued to make R&D investments. While we won't chase share for share's sake, we continue to see significant growth opportunity ahead as the clear market leader with the most comprehensive portfolio of offerings, from mission-critical and high-performance computing to our new IoT and Cloudline solutions. Storage had another strong quarter, with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by continued strength in 3PAR. Converged storage grew 17% year-over-year in constant currency, and is now a solid 56% of Storage revenue. We had record revenue for 3PAR, driven by triple-digit constant currency growth in all-flash, which grew at three times the market rates. With the industry-leading all flash product and the broadest reach through our channel, we expect to gain share for the ninth quarter in a row in calendar Q4. Turning to Networking, the significant actions we took last year are paying off, and we are very pleased with the performance overall. Networking revenue grew 62% year-over-year in constant currency. Normalized for the Aruba acquisition, revenue grew double-digits, driven by record China revenue as well as good performance in other regions. As we've discussed before, we are seeing strength in China, as customers anticipate the completion of the deal with Tsinghua that we announced last year. We are currently working through the final regulatory approval in China, and we expect the deal to close by the end of May. Aruba also grew double-digits at an operational level, and we saw strong pull-through of HPE's switching portfolio to complement Aruba's wireless offerings. Technology Services revenue was down 3% in constant currency, although TS support performed better. Total orders grew year-over-year excluding China, where we are seeing some customers delaying renewals until the Tsinghua transaction closes. Unlike Networking or Servers, these are long-term contracts and we believe some customers are waiting to work directly with the new entity. We also saw constant currency double-digit order growth in new solutions, like Datacenter Care and Proactive Care. We expect TS performance to improve throughout the year driven by a better mix of new, faster growing support solutions. In Cloud, following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials. This momentum reinforces our belief that our strategy of helping customers transform to a hybrid infrastructure is a winning approach for us. Enterprise Services continues to execute well against its turnaround strategy. ES is building a more diversified customer base, stabilizing revenue and significantly reducing its cost structure. For example, during the quarter we grew new business TCV by 4% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an agreement with Sabre to provide virtualization, automation and security services, hardware and software to support faster product development, and extend Sabre's position in the global travel industry. And it includes an agreement with Avon to transform key elements of the leading beauty company's global IT infrastructure by offering dedicated data center services, cross-functional support, network management and security services. This builds on the progress we've made over the past three years. Remember that in FY 2013 just three customers made up approximately 65% of ES operating profit. Today, no account makes up more than 10%. We also continue to make progress on our cost structure by exiting high-cost data centers, improving low-cost location mix and rebalancing our workforce. As a result, Q1 revenue grew slightly in constant currency, marking the first quarter with constant currency growth since Q3 of 2012. We also had our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion, Q1 operating margin of 5.1% improved 2.1 points year-over-year driven largely by delivery cost actions. Overall, I believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our long-term goal of a sustainable market-competitive cost structure with the 7% to 9% operating profit margin. In Software, we continued to make progress aligning the portfolio and go-to-market through our four transformation areas, increasing efficiency and accelerating SaaS. This has included the divestiture of several Software businesses that were not core to our strategy, including iManage, LiveVault and TippingPoint, which we expect to close later this month. In Q1, Software returned to growth with revenue up 1% in constant currency when adjusted for recent M&A activity. The ADM/ITOM business was down slightly in constant currency, as continued headwinds in license and support were nearly offset by Professional Services and record revenue growth in SaaS, which grew over 20% year-over-year. Big Data was strong with revenue up double-digits when normalized for currency and divestitures, driven by triple-digit growth in vertical license. Security performance was also strong across both license and SaaS. Financial Services continues to provide our customers with the financing flexibility they need to take on their biggest IT challenges. At the same time, the team does a great job managing this business to minimize our risk and maximize our return. Financial Services revenue grew 3% in constant currency in Q1 and financing volume also increased to 3% year-over-year. Before I hand it over to Tim to provide further insight into the financials, I want to highlight some of the exciting product announcements from the quarter. One of the most important benefits of being a smaller, more focused company is that we are able to be very targeted in our investments and to even more effectively put our resources towards the most important high potential opportunities that support our strategy. As we've discussed before, we prioritize organic investments to maintain a strong technology pipeline. At Discover in December, we unveiled HPE Synergy, a new category of infrastructure designed to run both traditional and cloud native applications for organizations running a hybrid infrastructure. Synergy, powered by our OneView software represents a critical step in delivering our vision for hybrid infrastructure. We also introduced our new IoT Edgeline Systems and Aruba networking sensors specifically designed to help customers more efficiently collect, process, and analyze IoT data. The new solutions are key elements of our strategy of delivering more connectivity and computing power at the network edge, and you can expect more IoT announcements coming up this year. And in January, HPE expanded its network function virtualization portfolio. We announced HPE Service Director, a new end-to-end service operation solution designed to help communication service providers managed services in NFV deployments by bridging traditional and new virtualized environments. In addition to organic investments, we are also investing in key partnerships. In January, HPE and Scality announced an enhanced partnership designed to accelerate the adoption of software-defined storage. And we announced a new partnership with Microsoft appointing Azure as a preferred public cloud partner for HPE customers while HPE now serves as a preferred partner in providing infrastructure and services for Microsoft's hybrid cloud offerings. As a result of this commitment to innovation, our products and services are being recognized as leaders in the industry. For example, we are now named a leader in 26 different Gartner Magic Quadrants including integrated systems, modular servers, storage disk arrays, and wired and wireless infrastructure. Forester has ranked Enterprise Services as a leader in workplace services and positioned HPE as a leader in its recent private cloud report. And IDC ranked us as leader in application modernization services. Looking forward, you can expect this momentum and investment in innovation to continue. Later this month, we will announce a new market-changing hyper-converged offering based on our industry-leading ProLiant virtualization server. Our new solution will offer customers installation in minutes, a consumer-inspired simple mobile array user experience, and automated IT operations, all at 20% lower cost than Nutanix. We believe this new system will allow us to quickly become a top player in the $5 billion high-growth hyper-converged market. Also later this month, we'll refresh our server portfolio to include a game-changing new technology called Persistent Memory, which was invented by our server group. This new technology will enable an ecosystem of new applications supporting non-volatile memory and is a key milestone on our journey to the machine. So overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter as an independent company. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused organization, and I'm excited about what's ahead. On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim. Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone. We've now completed our first quarter as a standalone company and overall I'm pleased with our performance. As part of the separation process, we developed a clear financial architecture for HPE, where each business segment has a specific role in driving overall company performance. Enterprise Group is our growth engine, Enterprise Services is committed to stabilizing revenue and expanding margins, Software provides high margins and strong cash flow, and Financial Services provides a consistent annuity-based revenue stream. After only one quarter, it's already clear that each business is executing against this framework and, as a result, is driving solid financial performance at the HPE level. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, down 2.5% year-over-year, but up 3.8% in constant currency. And as Meg said, this marks our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Clearly, currency was a significant headwind this quarter. You might recall that we saw the most significant movement in currencies during our first fiscal quarter last year, which drove a large rate translation impact this year and a total currency impact of 6 points year-over-year. Going forward, currency will still be a significant impact in Q2 and then moderate in the second half. And we still anticipate a currency headwind of approximately 3 points to revenue for the full year. Looking at performance by geography. We had some challenges in the Americas, which grew 1% year- over-year in constant currency with increased weakness in January, particularly in U.S. hardware as macro uncertainty caused a slowdown in global accounts funding. EMEA delivered growth of 4% year-over-year in constant currency driven by balanced growth across EG hardware. APJ saw the best growth at 9% year-over-year in constant currency due to strength in servers and record China networking revenue. The gross margin was 28.4%, down 1.2 points sequentially due to normal seasonality and up 70 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by continued productivity improvements in Enterprise Services. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 3% year-over-year driven by R&D as we continue to make targeted investments. Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.1%, down 1.5 points sequentially and down 40 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.41, at the top of our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pre-tax charges of $311 million for restructuring charges, $218 million for amortization of intangible assets, and $79 million for separation costs. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.15, $0.02 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.09 to $0.13 due primarily to tax indemnification adjustments related to the separation. Free cash flow was negative $831 million, down 70% year-on-year on an adjusted basis that reflects the estimated HPE contribution to the combined HP company free cash flow last year. As we discussed during the Q4 earnings call, Q1 is usually our lowest cash flow quarter due primarily to earnings seasonality in ES and Software as well as normal annual bonus compensation payments. You can see the seasonal pattern in our adjusted fiscal year 2015 results when our free cash flow for Q1 was a use of approximately $500 million. In addition to normal seasonality, in Q1 2016 we had higher separation payments year-over-year, which are now largely complete, and higher usage of working capital. Let me explain what's happening with working capital. The cash conversion cycle was 31 days, up eight days sequentially. This was above our targeted levels of mid-20 days primarily due to payables that were impacted by intra-quarter purchasing linearity and strategic buys that provide an economic benefit to the company. These items are largely timing related, and we continue to more aggressively manage our working capital and expect the cash conversion cycle to improve throughout the year and return to our targeted levels. With all that in mind, we remain committed to our free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. Turning to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.2 billion for share repurchases, including $1.1 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program and an additional $132 million on the open market as part of our ongoing share repurchase program. We also distributed $96 million as part of our normal dividend. To-date, we have already returned over 60% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders. And now we are raising our commitment and expect to return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders in fiscal year 2016. Separately, as Meg noted, we expect the Tsinghua transaction to close near the end of May. When the deal closes, we expect to receive cash of just over $2 billion that is net of some initial tax on the sale. We are planning to use the vast majority of this cash to opportunistically repurchase shares. The timing of the repurchases may not be linear and will be dependent on several factors, including market conditions and availability of U.S. cash. Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group delivered healthy growth and stable profitability, in line with our financial architecture. As Meg discussed, we are investing in innovation across EG to deliver best-in-class solutions in growing markets, while maintaining cost discipline and solid profitability. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year as reported, or 7% in constant currency with strength across all hardware groups. Profitability was down 1.8 points to 13.4%, primarily due to FX and to a lesser extent, product mix. Servers revenue was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by strong Tier 1 and by core sales in both EMEA and APJ. This was somewhat offset by pressure in the Americas towards the end of the quarter. Our R&D investments continue to pay off with our industry-leading offerings in high-performance compute that now exceeds a $1 billion run rate and strong double-digit growth in mission-critical x86 servers. Looking forward, we continue to see opportunities for profitable revenue growth and share expansion in the server market. We have the most comprehensive and compelling server portfolio with solutions for every workload. And we are aggressively taking advantage of the uncertainty in the markets surrounding our competitors. Storage revenue declined 3% year-on-year as reported, but grew 3% in constant currency. The unified 3PAR architecture combined with our excellent channel partnerships continues to drive revenue growth and share gains, while our competitors are distracted and contracting. 3PAR all-flash grew triple digits again, driving 3PAR revenue growth of 21% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 15% year-over-year in constant currency. We estimate that we've gained solid market share in the fourth calendar quarter and expect Storage to continue be a growth driver in constant currency throughout the remainder of the year. Networking revenue grew 54% year-over-year as reported, or 62% in constant currency, and expanded operating margins, driven by the acquisition of Aruba and strong execution across all regions. When adjusted for Aruba, Networking revenue was still up double digits in constant currency. The Aruba acquisition continues to prove to be a key strategic move for HPE and has transformed our Networking business. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless and it's also been integral in returning switching to double-digit growth year-over-year. TS revenue declined 9% year-over-year as reported, or 3% in constant currency. However, approximately one point of the decline was due to the discontinuation of HPI related service contracts that were supported by TS last year. Encouragingly, TS support, which has significantly higher margins than consulting, continued to stabilize and revenue was only down 2% year-over-year in constant currency, including the HPI impact. Orders were down slightly in constant currency, but up excluding China, where signings have been delayed ahead of the Tsinghua deal close date. Enterprise Services executed well against its plan to stabilize the top line and expand margins. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year, but grew slightly in constant currency. Applications and Business Services, which you'll recall is the higher margin business within ES, continued to improve with a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, driven by strong apps performance in stabilization and business process services. Strategic Enterprise Services revenue was up double digits year-on-year, with strong growth in Helion Managed Cloud. Overall, TCV was up nearly 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strong renewals as well as growth in new logos and add-ons. ES operating profit improved 2.1 points year-over-year to 5.1% as the team continued to execute productivity improvements and delivery in sales and improved new deal profitability. We also had a benefit from a one-time divestiture of a non-core business. We continue to make progress against the cost takeout plan we laid out at our Analyst Meeting. We now have approximately 45% of our workforce in low-cost locations and are well on our way to our longer-term goal of 60%. Given the progress we have made on bookings and cost improvements, along with our normal quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 6% to 7% and revenue of down 2% to flat year-over-year in constant currency. Software executed well in the quarter, improving revenue and delivering strong profitability, while continuing to become more tightly integrated with the rest of the HPE portfolio and go-to-market approach. Revenue declined 10% year-over-year as reported, or 6% in constant currency, but was up 1% when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures in constant currency. We saw strong performance in big data and also some growth in security, offset by declines in IT Management. SaaS had a very good quarter growing double digits in constant currency when adjusted for divestitures driven by ADM, ITOM and security. Operating profit was 17.4%, down 60 basis points year-over-year due primarily to currency and a higher mix of Professional Services. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, but is still making strategic R&D investments in growth areas that align well with the broader HPE portfolio. In Financial Services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year, but grew 3% in constant currency as we began to see more impact from the volume growth we delivered last year. Financing volume in the quarter declined 4% year-over-year, but was up 3% in constant currency. Operating profit improved 1.7 points year-over-year to 12.9% as we were able to adjust bad debt reserves to reflect the improved loss rates and our high quality portfolio. Return on equity was up one point year-over-year to 18.1%. Now turning to our outlook. We will not formally update our fiscal year 2016 outlook for the impact of Tsinghua transaction until after it closes, but I wanted to give you some information about how to think about the potential impact. We now anticipate the deal to close near the end of May and expect the transaction will impact fiscal year 2016 EPS operationally by approximately $0.05. This includes some stranded costs from corporate administrative functions that we will mitigate in the near term. After the transaction closes, we will update our fiscal year 2016 free cash flow and EPS outlook, including any expected benefit from share repurchases made with the sales proceeds. Also, we do have an EPS benefit from our share repurchases completed in Q1 and still feel confident in the underlying operating performance of the business, but it's too early in the year to change our full-year outlook given the softness in January and near-term market uncertainty. With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.39 to $0.43 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full-year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.13 to$0.17 in Q2 2016 and continue to expect full-year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75-$0.85. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Good job on the operating margins. I was hoping you could give us some detail about how you're thinking but margins, particularly in the Enterprise Group as we move through fiscal 2016 and some of the other operating margins? I you've commented on Enterprise Services, but wanted to get your sense about the Enterprise Group in particular with the new products coming out? Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Sherri. We did see some margin deterioration year-over-year if you look at the margins for EG, in total, they were at 13.4%. Most of that was driven by FX, so keep in mind in the first quarter last year the euro, as an example, was at 124 and the average accounting rates in the first quarter this year was 108. So we still saw significant pressure from a FX perspective when you look at the first quarter. Going out for the rest of the year, we would expect the margins to stabilize and maybe get a little bit of a lift particularly as we continue to grow the storage business as well as the networking business. So as you know, those businesses have a healthier margin profile so as we continue to grow those, we should see some lift there. And then, the only other major comment I'd make is on the ES business. Again, we saw some great performance there in the first quarter, margins at 5.1%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. So the efforts of the team continues to execute upon as they're transforming that business, and the seasonality in that business. We would expect those margins to improve over the course of the year and settle on average in the range of 6% to 7% as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting in September. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And then just thinking about your free cash flow guidance. Now you're planning to spend 100% of your free cash flow, returning that to shareholders. Does that change your acquisition strategy? What are you thinking about acquisitions this year? Thank you. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, we continue to execute a returns based capital allocation strategy, and given where the stock price has been trading, this is one of the best return on investments that we can actually make. And as I said when we were on our road show for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise, our first choice is, from an innovation perspective is organic innovation. Look at the success of the 3PAR all-flash storage array, internally homegrown, growing three times the rate of the market, and gives that benefit of a common architecture from top to bottom. The benefit of doing organic innovation is you don't end up with a Frankenstein of architectures. The second choice would be acquisitions that look like 3PAR, 3Com and Aruba. These have been very successful acquisitions for us. They are additional complementary technology that goes through our excellent distribution system. But, again, where the stock is trading right now? We think that this makes a lot of sense to buy back shares, which is why we've decided to go to 100% of the free cash flow. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Sherri. Next question, please. Operator : The next question will come from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I just have a couple of clarifications, actually. Maybe for Meg, first of all, and Tim touched upon this. You talked about how you're seeing constant currency revenue growth over several quarters. All businesses have grown since the end of 2010. Are we now at the point whereby this business might sustainably at constant currency in revenue terms just grow? I'm not asking for a number of percentage growth rate, but do you think you have that visibility? Because the reason why I ask is, Tim also mentioned visibility in January, and obviously, we can see what the markets have been doing and the macro. So I'm kind of curious as to how we see sustainable growth of the business? And then also, just for Tim, on the Enterprise Services margin guidance and the growth guidance for this year, given the contract value growth, given the mix shift you're seeing in the business, the cost changes you're putting through very well, why isn't \u2013 that guidance just seems for Enterprise Service is now very conservative. So is there some caution you're reflecting in that guidance in the balance on the Enterprise Services side specifically? Many thanks. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So on the overall growth rate of the company, remember, we said at the beginning of this year that we would grow Hewlett Packard Enterprise in revenues in constant currency, and we are on track to do that as you can see from Q1. Again, from an as-reported basis, the compares get earlier \u2013 I mean, get better in the second half of the year because we've worked through those big currency fluctuations in Q1 of last year. And I think your question is, can we see accelerated growth? I think we just are a little concerned about the macroeconomic environment. We saw a slowdown in the U.S. in the last three weeks of January. Linearity appears to be back on track, but it's early in the game, and so I think we're just being a bit cautious here. We like our product portfolio. We like our go-to-market changes. We like our innovation engine. There's a lot of things that we're feeling very good about, but the macroeconomic environment still has pockets of weakness. Russia continues to be a big challenge, the Ukraine, parts of Latin America. China right now for us is doing well, but that can change at any minute. So, we feel great about the stated goal of growth in constant currencies, and let's see how the macroeconomic and sort of the political environment changes over time. Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. And then on the ES point, again, we feel great about the progress we've made in the first quarter. We have the delivery centers in motion. We continue to move folks from high-cost countries to low-cost countries, so the team has done a tremendous job in transforming the business. Now, to your question, as we continue to progress in the year, we're going to continue to see pricing pressure in that business. It's very competitive. We're going to continue to invest in the business, particularly in that go-to-market motion. So, and also given the fact that it's really just the first quarter, so we have nine more months to go. There is some market uncertainty out there, so we just felt it prudent to stick with the 6% to 7%. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Next question, please. Operator : The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. I'm wondering if you can update us on the status of expected restructuring and separation charges? I think as of last call, you had talked about $1.7 billion in cash impact this year and that you expect it to be front-end loaded. It ended up being less than one quarter of the year's total. And so, I'm wondering if a) you can give us an update on how many people came out in the quarter, what that expectation is for the year, and are we incorrect in what I just played back in terms of understanding that this didn't appear to be more front-end loaded, in fact, it felt less than linear, and why that might be? Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure, Toni. A couple of things that I'd say about the restructuring. We are on track. So as we called out at the Analyst Meeting, we will be about $1.2 billion in cash. So we are on track for that this year. And then as far as how many folks that we've taken out so far, it will be 3,000 in the first quarter. We don't really guide on what we're going to take out for the entire year, but the only thing I'd say is we're on track and that $1.2 billion in cash for this year still remains there. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And separation, that was $600 million I believe and you did $79 million in the quarter, where do you stand on that? Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. We did $300 million. You're right, it's $600 million in separation for the year, and we did $300 million in the first quarter. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. But the cash impact was only $79 million or was it grouped in another group then? Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. No, the cash impact was a $300 million payment. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then finally, you mentioned the benefit from a divestiture in ES. Was that a margin benefit? And is that part of the reason for not being more optimistic about margins over the course of the year? Or was that either immaterial or a revenue impact? Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, that did have a impact from a margin perspective. I'd say it was not really material. It does have some impact on the margin to your point, but overall we feel very good about the health of the ES margins. Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Toni. Next question, please. Operator : The next question will come from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Just quickly two questions. One, bad debt reserves, you mentioned was a benefit to Financial Services margins in the quarter. Was that a one-time benefit or does that flow through to future quarters? And then secondly, the sale to Tsinghua is taking longer than expected. Can you just talk about what milestones are left to get that deal completed and just some context around why it's been delayed? Thank you. Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. I'll hit the bad debt reserve and then I'll let Meg talk about Tsinghua. So the bad debt reserve was a one-time benefit. It was about, I think it was about 150 basis points of the improvement, and it's primarily driven by the fact that we adjusted reserves. We're still very conservative, but if you look at our loss reserves as a percentage of expected or historical losses, it's still at about two times, which is very conservative in the Financial Services business. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Katy, let me talk a little bit about Tsinghua. So you recall, we originally thought this would close roughly at the end of February, and now we are confident that the deal is going to close near the end of May. And we're working through some final Chinese regulatory approvals, so all the U.S. approvals have been received, (38:20), et cetera. Only the China Securities Regulatory Committee remains. They call that the CSRC in China, which is a bit like our SEC. And there has been a couple of things going on there. One is they have a new head of the CSRC. Two, there is a big backlog of deals, and they're working through that backlog. But we feel confident. We expect that deal to close at the end of May. As you can imagine, we've been in contact with all the appropriate regulatory people and obviously our partners at Tsinghua. So that's the way we think about it right now. There's also, as you know, a fair amount of volatility in the markets in China, and I think that frankly is slowing things down a little bit in China. And by the way, the H3C revenue over there is doing great. We had a record revenue for our China Networking business, and I take that as a positive sign. It means that the Chinese government is still leaning into H3C and that product and that business is being very well received in the China market. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thanks, Katy. Next question, please. Operator : And our next question will come from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Just two if I could. First quickly, Meg, you mentioned a few times the January weakness. Is this just macro? Any parts of your business or verticals that is hit more meaningfully? And then onto the networking business, I think you mentioned Aruba helping the switching business get back to double-digit growth. Could you just talk a little bit about is that AC driven? Or what is it that's helping those two businesses do such a good job of cross-selling? Thank you. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So the January weakness, we saw the last three weeks in January slow significantly in the United States, actually not that dissimilar from what I believe Cisco referred to on their call. And I don't have a good explanation of that except for one or two things. One is, remember the opening week in the market in 2016 was really tough, right? And I think companies are quite now extra sensitive to volatility in the market. They are quite quick to be cautious and pull back purchases. From a vertical perspective, obviously the weakest vertical was oil and natural gas. We saw that across the board and a lot of our oil and natural gas customers are in the United States. So that was a challenge and will probably continue. What I will say is, while I'm cautious about it, it looks like February has returned to the linearity that we would have expected. Oil and natural gas continues to be a bit weak, but there's been some strength in other parts. So, I'm not quite sure what happened in those last three weeks, but that would be my guess. Turning to Aruba and why it has helped our networking switch business, it's because the customers now believe we're completely committed to the Networking business. We are all in on Networking, and while we had HP Networking before, I think people thought, well, maybe they are not 100% committed, maybe a bit below scale. With the acquisition of Aruba, they've gained a great deal of confidence in our product roadmap and in our commitment to the business. And so Aruba I think has cast a really nice glow over the rest of our HP networking business. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you very much. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Thank you, Tim. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. I was just wondering if you just could help us a little more in terms of granularity around quarterly free cash flow and the charges. In particular, do you think that in the next quarter that your free cash flow will end up being positive and then continue to grow off of that? And then secondly just on Enterprise Services, are there any metrics you can provide or plan to give us at some point to give us some comfort on revenue stabilization? Whether it's book-to-bill or some other metrics? Thanks. Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. On the quarterly free cash flow, we're not going to guide on a quarterly basis. But, if you think about it, obviously, first quarter for us is seasonally low and that's primarily driven by earnings seasonality, right, which is driven by the profiles in ES and Software as well as the timing of that bonus payment, which happens in the first quarter of every year, it's a one-time payment. So we saw that same seasonality last year. Now going forward what I would say is we're going to get improvements every quarter, and primarily four areas; one, earnings improvement. So obviously we're back-ended loaded from an earnings perspective, particularly in the Second half. So as those earnings improve, obviously, our free cash flow will improve. The bonus payment is behind us now, so that is no longer a drag as you go forward. The cash conversion cycle, we were disappointed with the 31 days, but when you look at the fundamentals of our terms and mix, we're confident that that will get back to the mid-20 day range, so that will drive a significant amount of improvement. And then lastly the separation. So to Toni's question, we had $600 million of separation charges planned for the year. We paid out $300 million of that in the first quarter, so that becomes less of a drag. So as we progress through every quarter, similar to last year you will see improvements. So I think if you look at the seasonality of last year, that would probably give you a pretty good reflection of how it may play out this year. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So let me talk a little bit about ES and your question about confidence in the revenue trajectory which member we said is, negative 2% to flat in constant currency. So I think there's a couple of things going on here. One is, this is the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth, not a huge amount, 0.1%, but relative to \u2013 from whence we've come in that business, this gives us a lot of confidence. It's the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth since Q3 of FY 2012. And ABS which happens to have a higher level of profitability than ITO, posted its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. SCS, as I mentioned that's our cloud, big data, security practices, grew over 30% year-over-year in Q1 and we saw some benefits from strong strategic Enterprise Services signings in FY 2015. I think we have also worked through the vast majority of the key account revenue runoff that we've talked about for the last couple of years. These were three or four very big ES customers that have now really runoff and have become quite predictable. And then I've got to give the Finance team and the Operations team and ES credit. We are much better now at forecasting revenue than we have been. It's a very granular account by account forecast profit \u2013 forecast of revenue by type of practice. And that gives us a lot of confidence. So as we sit here today and we look out at the landscape and we see a book-to-bill ratio of roughly 1, we feel good about that negative 2% to flat. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Maynard. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : Yes. The next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Two things. First of all, if you could comment on the EMC-Dell deal? I'm sure you're going to say that it's an opportunity to gain share, but do you have any proof points of that at this early date? And then second, you're going to be spending about $4 billion on stock repurchase here over time and it's at a time when IBM's had its biggest year of M&A, Dell and EMC are getting together, and there's probably more consolidation, Cisco is making a play for the data center, and you're very hardware-centric. So it seems like you should be making some acquisitions here. Are you comfortable with the strategic position that leaves you in? Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So let me talk a little bit about Dell-EMC. So it is interesting to note how different HP and Dell \u2013 we have taken very different strategies in this environment. There's no question. And my view of this is predicated upon the speed that this market is changing. And so we decided to get smaller while they got bigger. We decided to lean into new technology while they're doubling down on old technology in a cost takeout play. They levered up while we delevered. And we're super-focused on being fast and nimble for our customers. So both strategies may work. I happen to like our hand better than the Dell-EMC hand. So how are we taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace? So we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM's sale of their server business to Lenovo. We have a very focused channel play where we \u2013 actually it's called Smart Choice and we have a big opportunity to go take Dell and EMC business much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo. And so we're seeing good results in the marketplace. We're rolling out our full sales efforts. You're going to start to see even more advertising and digital as we capitalize on another one to two years of uncertainty as this deal closes and they work through the integration. The other thing is, as you think about it, we continue to invest in innovation. And you have to think about Dell-EMC in many ways as owned by private equity. And you can do your own calculation on what you think the debt interest payments are going to be. For perspective, the entire EMC R&D budget is $2.7 billion. So we feel good about our hand. Two completely different strategies, but I like where we are. In regards to M&A, as I said, our first priority is organic innovation and you're starting to see that innovation engine really kick into gear. And we started this, Steve, you'll remember four years ago. As we cut costs over the last four years, almost every single quarter year-over-year we spent more money on innovation and it's paying off. That doesn't say we won't do acquisitions, but I would reiterate it's returns-based and it is focused on companies like 3PAR, like 3Com, like Aruba that are complementary technology that fit into our overall four transformation areas as we go forward. So I think we've got the right strategy here, we're thoughtful about it. But if the right acquisition comes along and we feel like the price is appropriate, we'll go ahead and do it. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : For what it's worth I think the stock is too cheap, too. Thanks. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, we appreciate that, which is why we're backing up the truck. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Thank you, Steve. Next question, please. Operator : And next we have Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you very much. Just actually following up on that comment of backing up the truck, is the new target of returning 100% or more of free cash flow this year inclusive of the proceeds from the Tsinghua sale? Or would that be on top? And then I have a question as well. Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, the Tsinghua proceeds after the transaction would be on top of that. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And that would be targeted for this year as well in terms of buyback or is that market-dependent? Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's really market dependent. I mean, it's hard to tell. I don't mean to be evasive, but it really depends on market conditions. It depends on the availability of U.S. cash. There are multiple variables in the overall equation, but we are committed to returning a vast majority of that through share repurchases. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then, Meg, on the hyper-converged product you mentioned, is that an organic product? And how meaningful do you expect it to be for revenues this year? Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So it is an organic product developed in-house in record time and we're quite excited about this. The hyper-converged market is big. It's growing fast. It's also getting pretty crowded. You've seen a lot of announcements over the last couple of months, but we very much like this product from a side-by-side comparison and features and functionality to our competitors. Feel really good about it and I think it means that we can be a leader in this quite large and fast-growing part of the market. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Thanks, Simona. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : Yes. The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. Tim, in your working cap comments, you noted headwinds from intra-quarter linearity and some opportunistic purchases, what regions \u2013 was it primarily just the U.S. that drove that linearity difference or were there other regions that drove that difference? And what components were you procuring opportunistically? And I have a follow-up. Timothy C. Stonesifer - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It was primarily the U.S., but we did see some pressures across the globe. And again, if you think about timing challenges and free cash flow and cash conversion cycle, it's both sales and purchasing linearity, so this time around it was the purchasing linearity and then we also made some strategic buys. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thanks. And, Meg, just a follow-up on the last question around hyper-converged. Where do you think those dollars in hyper-converged take away from over the next several years? And do you view it as cannibalistic to any of your converged offerings? Thanks. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There certainly is some cannibalism there, probably the converged infrastructure play, but I would say that this is part of a migration to the next generation data center. What we're seeing from customers of all size, if your company is older than five or 10 years, you are trying to figure out how you're going to take your existing infrastructure to the next generation of IT. And so this is part of the sale of \u2013 okay, you can get more out of your existing IT if you transform to a hybrid infrastructure, and this is one of the core hardware components and software-defined components that allows you to get the most out of this next generation of IT. So, listen, our business is cannibalistic. Right? I mean, new products come in to replace old products, but we think we can get an increased share of that data center spend, which we see actually growing and overall the margins on CS are accretive to servers and to the EG Group in general. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Meg. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : Yes. The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. My question is regarding the Services segment. Recently both the federal government as well as the Military has talked about some big contracts coming up for renewal as well as potentially breaking them up into smaller pieces. And we're just wondering, is there any risk there for HP about any of these contracts coming up specifically kind of midyear or second half to where they will enter another realm of some large contracts running off? Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. Actually we think it's an opportunity for us because some of the contracts, at least the ones I'm aware of, are actually owned by many of our competitors. And so those competitors \u2013 I know one in particular that's going to break from one into three, and we have a really very good opportunity to get one out of those three that's right in our sweet spot. As has been widely reported, the U.S. Navy and Marines contract comes up \u2013 I can't remember if it's in 2017 or 2018. I think it's the end of 2017, beginning of 2018 we have to start rebidding that. But we know how to do that. We've done it for years. So actually I think we're on the right side of most of these federal contracts that are breaking up. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, Jim. I think we have... James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Thanks, Jim. I think we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will come from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Thank you very much. I'll just stick with one question. So, Meg, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing on the cloud? And I know you've signed a deal with Microsoft and you've talked a lot about a hybrid cloud, but maybe you can talk a bit about what you're hearing from customers in terms of their thoughts about moving to Azure or AWS solution versus maybe using more of a hybrid one? And then also how you're thinking about server impact this year and going forward from cloud, given last year was so strong and you still have benefit I think this year from Gen9? Thanks. Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, sure. So what we're hearing from customers is there is almost universal acceptance that their environments will be hybrid. And there's almost universal acceptance that it has to start with an analysis of the apps. How many apps does the customer want to have? Is there opportunities to reduce the number of apps and consolidate? And then what instantiation do you want that app to be on? Some apps are going to stay locked down in a customer's data center, untouched by anyone's hand other than their own employees, but some apps will go to a private cloud on-prem, a virtual private cloud, a managed private cloud, and then obviously to the public cloud. And we're seeing workloads move because even going from a traditional data center to the private cloud can be a 20% to 30% savings to a customer for that workload, which is meaningful. So, as you know, we are the leader in private cloud. It is the first step that many customers take and then they think okay, what would I like, what of my apps would I like to have in a virtual private cloud and a managed private cloud. I think there is an inexorable march from data center only apps to private cloud, VPC, MPC, and ultimately to the public cloud. So one of the other things we're doing here is developing our multi-cloud management layer, or one pane of glass, our orchestration and automation of your multi-cloud environment. How do you deploy workloads to these different clouds quickly and efficiently? So I think we've got the right strategy here. I think it was smart to get out of our spending on public cloud. I think that game has moved to Azure and AWS and maybe someday Google, and we're really pleased with our Azure partnership. So that's working well. The other thing I would say is, recall that we have built our cloud operation on Helion OpenStack and our Version 2.0 of what we call HOS, Helion OpenStack 2.0 is a significant improvement from 1.1 where we had some installer challenges. So we're getting a lot of good feedback around HOS 2.0 as well as our carrier-grade OpenStack which is, of course, of interest to the telcos. We had a very good Mobile World Congress show. I was there for three days and our open NFV solution, we have 60 POCs across the globe and a couple of very big customer wins. So I feel like we're on the right strategy. The world's changing at breakneck speed, but we feel good about our strategy and I feel good actually about having chosen OpenStack. Two or three years ago, I was getting a little concerned because I wasn't sure how fast OpenStack was going to mature, but it seems like it's finally hitting the knee of the curve and the adult supervision that a number of big companies have provided is actually helping. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Great. And server thoughts? Margaret C. Whitman - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Server. Yeah, so we actually see growth in high-performance compute; growth in Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 service provider. And in some parts of the world, core server growth. But we've got to make sure that we have the best server roadmap and the best opportunity for customers to run existing applications or cloud native apps, hence, HPE Synergy, which allows a developer to basically compose the infrastructure they need for their app. So HPE Synergy isn't exactly cloud by any stretch of the imagination, but it is in fact the next generation of infrastructure for the software-defined data center. I would also say that we are gaining share in that market. There's no question about it. We did a great job I think in grabbing share from Lenovo, as I said earlier, when those servers moved from IBM. And we are all over this Dell-EMC opportunity. So in a flat to declining market, which probably core servers are, at least over the next five years, we have to gain share, but there are real pockets of growth in the market as well. And HPC, by the way, high performance compute, we're like the last man standing there and we're investing in HPC and it's a core competency for the company. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC : Thank you. Andrew Simanek - Director, Head of Investor Relations : Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. And, operator, I think we can conclude the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

My name is Annie and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andrew Simanek : Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And I\u2019d like to welcome you to our Fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and joining later Mike Lawrie, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CSC. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at www.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings and transaction materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release. With that, let me turn it over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Thanks, Andy. And thank you to everyone on the call for joining us today. Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed our second full quarter as an independent company, and I have to say that we have delivered the best performance since I joined. In Q2, we saw our first quarter of as reported year-over-year revenue growth since 2011 for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise businesses. We also saw our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth. We delivered revenue of $12.7 billion, up more than 1% as reported and 5% in constant currency, driven by excellent performance in servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure, as well as outstanding performance in enterprise services. Enterprise Group had a fabulous quarter, delivering 7% revenue growth on an as reported basis and 10% in constant currency. In fact, we grew on an as reported basis in every one of EG\u2019s hardware business units and in every region. ES grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency for the second consecutive quarter and expanded operating margins more than three points over the prior year. That\u2019s the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. Our Software business also delivered a strong quarter. When adjusted for divestitures and acquisitions, Software delivered its third consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And in Financial Services, we saw double digit volume growth over the prior year.  So, with strong performance across every one of our business segments, HPE delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.42, at the high end of our previously provided outlook. Free cash flow improved in the second quarter to $511 million due to careful management of our working capital. Tim will walk through the drivers of our cash flow and outlook shortly. And we are seeing the benefits of our increased R&D and more focused product roadmaps as we take share from our competitors. In storage, HPE is the only major vendor to gain share in external disk over the last two years, while EMC, NetApp, IBM and Dell lost share year-over-year. Revenue in our 3PAR all-flash business grew nearly triple digits, about two times faster than the market, and is once again expected to be larger and faster growing and pure. In networking, we are seeing an acceleration of our business, particularly since our acquisition of Aruba and our game changing partnership with Unisplendour, a subsidiary of Tsinghua in China. And our results are in stark contrast with the results Cisco reported last week. In switching, HPE grew 18% year-over-year versus Cisco that was down 3%. And we are getting credit from the industry for our innovation, capturing the leading position in Gartner\u2019s most recent Magic Quadrant for Wired and Wireless offsetting Cisco\u2019s long standing run in the top spot. That is an addition to our leading positions in servers, storage and integrated systems, and we are not taking our foot off the pedal. Next month at Discover Las Vegas, you\u2019ll be hearing more about some significant new innovations across our cloud, IoT and compostable infrastructure product lines as well as an update on the machine. Last but certainly not least, earlier today, we made a major announcement that we are planning a tax-free spin-off and merger of our enterprise services business with CSC, which is expected to create a pure play global IT services powerhouse with annual revenue of more than $26 billion. The new company will have more than 5,000 customers in 70 countries and employees in every region around the world. The transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.5 billion to HPE\u2019s shareholders on an after tax basis. This includes an equity stake in the newly combined company valued at more than $4.5 billion, which represents approximately 50% ownership, a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and the assumption of $2.5 billion of debt and other liabilities. We also expect the merger of the two businesses to produce first year synergies of approximately $1 billion post close with the run rate of $1.5 billion by the end of year one. There is also an opportunity for additional synergies in subsequent years. As owners earn approximately 50% of the merged company, HPE shareholders will share and value of the synergies as well as future growth in earnings. The cost to separate ES from HPE will be offset by lower cost associated with the previously announced fiscal year 2015 restructuring program. So, there will be no incremental one-time cash payments beyond what we\u2019ve already communicated. I will serve on the Board of the new company and HPE\u2019s Board of Directors will nominate half of the new company\u2019s Board. Mike Lawrie, the current Head of CSC will become Chairman and CEO of the new company and Mike Nefkens, the current EVP and General Manager of our Enterprise Services business will become a key part of the new company\u2019s executive team and partner closely with Mike Lawrie on building the new organization. Other executives and directors as well as the name of the company will be announced at a later date. The transaction is currently targeted to be completed by March 31, 2017. For the combined CSC and Enterprise Services, this will create a new company that will be a pure-play global IT services leader. For customers, this means global access to world class offerings in cloud, mobility, application development and modernization, business process services, IT services, big data and analytics, and securities. This is combined with deep industry experience in sectors that include financial services, transportation, consumer products, healthcare and insurance. HPE and this new company will be closely connected moving forward with agreements that will keep the two companies aligned for current customers and grow new business opportunities over time. For the remaining Hewlett Packard Enterprise, this transaction creates significant incremental value by unlocking a faster growing, higher margin and stronger free cash flow business. HPE will now have $33 billion in annual revenue and will focus on secure next generation software defined infrastructure that leverages a world class portfolio of servers, storage, networking, converged infrastructure as well as our Helion cloud platform and software assets. By bringing together leadership positions in these key datacenter technologies, we will help customers run their traditional IT better while building a bridge to multi-cloud environments. Beyond the datacenter, HPE is redefining IT at the edge with our next generation of Aruba and computing products for campus, branch and IoT applications. In addition, through our Technology Services division, we can deliver consulting and support to customers while HPE Financial Services offers financial flexibilities to customers to maximize their investments. Finally, we will continue to leverage our portfolio of operations, securities and big data software assets that deliver machine learning and deep analytics capabilities to customers. Mike Lawrie has joined our call today and will have much more to say about the deal in a moment. But first, Tim is going to walk us through HPE\u2019s financial performance in detail. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue as reported and in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow, and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guided range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year and grew 4.9% in constant currency, our fourth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And as Meg mentioned, HPE businesses reported absolute revenue growth for the first time in five years. We saw revenue growth in constant currency in every region and outright growth in the Americas and APJ. Our Americas performance continues to support cautious optimism for the remainder of the year, amongst an uneven macroeconomic environment. In EMEA, we were still significantly impacted by currency. However, we\u2019re seeing encouraging momentum in enterprise hardware. And in APJ, China networking drove strong performance. The top-line currency impact to revenue was 4 points year-over-year, primarily due to hedging gains from the prior year. Going forward, we expect the currency impact to significantly moderate throughout the second half of the year. And we continue to anticipate an impact to revenue of approximately 3 points for the full year, as rates are now roughly in line with where they were when we originally guided the year. Margins were largely stable in the quarter with gross margin of 28.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. And non-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. Total non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 4.7% year-over-year, primarily due to increased FSC [ph] and R&D investments. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42, at the high end of our guided range. This primarily excludes $201 million for amortization of intangible assets, a $161 million for restructuring, and $91 million of separation charges. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, a penny above our previously guided range. Now, turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group had a strong quarter with excellent top line performance. Our sales motion is hitting its stride aided by the seamless launch of the HPE brand and our marketing efforts. Revenue was up 7% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency and grew in all product groups. For the remainder of the year, revenue growth will likely moderate as we will not have the benefit of H3C and begin to face tougher compares. Profitability in the quarter was 11.7%, down 240 basis points year-on-year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange, heavier Tier 1 mix and to a lesser degree incremental R&D investments. A deal that exemplifies the strength of the Enterprise Group is the recently won project with Woolworths Limited, Australia\u2019s largest retail company. Our solution, based on the ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA provides access to real time data, enabling critical business decisions to be made immediately. This competitive win against Lenovo, Fujitsu and Dimension Data with Cisco UCS also displays as the current outsource provider with pro and further secures HPE\u2019s relationship with Woolworths. Service revenue grew 7% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong Tier 1 sales in the Americas and core servers in APJ. Based on our performance, we believe we took share in servers overall, density optimized servers and rack. From a regional perspective we took share in the Americas and EMEA. And this quarter, we started shipping our Hyper Converged HC 380 which enables midsized and remote office enterprises to easily deploy, manage and support virtual machines in a few clicks. We continue to see servers as a growth drivers, given the strength of our portfolio and anticipate healthy demand for compute through the remainder of the year. In storage, we grew revenue 2% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. Converged storage continued its strong growth trend, growing 19% year-over-year in constant currency and comprising 54% of the total portfolio. 3PAR all-flash revenue grew near triple-digits and continues to drive mid range share gains. We estimate that we gain market share in the external disk for the tenth consecutive quarter and expect storage to gain shares throughout the remainder of the year on the strength of the 3PAR portfolio and new logo wins as we take advantage of the uncertainties surrounding the Dell-EMC merger. Networking revenue grew 57% year-over-year as reported or 62% in constant currency. And when adjusted for a Aruba, networking was still up 17% in constant currency. We had strong execution with growth across all regions. While Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless share, we also expect to take share in switching and routing on the strength of H3C and Aruba campus switching pull-through. Leading up to the transaction closed with Tsinghua, H3C grew more than 50% year-over-year, validating the strategic moves we made to collaborate with a strong local partner. In Technology Services, revenue did decline 6% year-on-year or 2% in constant currency. However, it was only down 1% in constant currency when adjusted for the discontinuation of HP Inc. attach, which remains in the fiscal year 2015 results. TS support, the most profitable and largest segment of Technology Services, grew orders in constant currency. Based on this and the order growth we saw last year, we continue to expect TS revenue to return to growth in constant currency, towards the end of the year. Enterprise Services had another great quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring cost actions and improving sales motion. A great example of the deals we are winning is our recent selection from five other competitors for a 10-year $0.5 billion contract to provide IT services including infrastructure, mission critical systems, and applications to the U.S. Strategic Command. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. When adjusted for the Deutsche Bank win last year, both new business TCV and total TCV grew year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services is gaining strength in both overall revenue and mix, delivering mid double-digit growth year-on-year. ABS continues to improve with the third consecutive quarter of year-on-year constant currency revenue growth and ITO also grew in constant currency, the first time since the first quarter of 2012. Operating profit improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 6.7%, as the team continues to execute productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We\u2019re also seeing the benefits from improving location mix as well as increasing sold margins and healthy add-on sales. We continue to track well against our longer term goal of 60-40 low cost, high cost headcount mix, and completed the quarter with 47% of our headcount in low cost centers. The progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality, provides us with confidence that operating profit margins for the full year will now be towards the high-end of our original 6% to 7% outlook. Software declined 13% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency. However, was up 2% in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. Sales strength in security and big data was partially offset by declines in IT Management. On a product level, we had encouraging results in Voltage, Fortify and IDOL. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost control, decreasing OpEx dollars year-over-year and growing operating profit dollars. Operating profit margin expanded 7 points year-over-year. However, the largest contributor to OpEx and margin improvement was a one-time benefit from the TippingPoint divestiture. HPE Financial Services revenue decline 2% year-over-year, but grew 1% on constant currency. Operating profit declined 130 basis points year-over-year to 9.3% as lower residual sales pressured margin rates. Financing volume grew 15% or 19% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable movement in our cost of fund which has enabled us to price more competitively. Return on equity was down 230 basis points year-on-year to 12.7%. Cash flow was strong in the quarter due to judicious working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, up 101% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $511 million, up from negative $106 million last year, again on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sale of H3C, the cash conversion cycle was 27 days, down 4 days, quarter-over-quarter. The largest contributor to cash conversion cycle improvement was DPO, which increased five days sequentially, adjusted for H3C, as we continue to improve payment terms with our vendors. This was partly offset by DSO, which increased two days sequentially, while DOI was flat through the quarter. Given the momentum in our working capital initiatives, we now expect our cash conversion cycle will reach the low 20-day range by the year-end. Now, let\u2019s turn to capital allocation. In the quarter, we returned $109 million of cash to shareholders. Due to the ES CSC transaction, we were largely prohibited from repurchasing shares and only bought back $15 million of shares. We also paid $94 million as part of our normal dividend. We continue to see our shares as very attractively priced and will be back in the market this month. Along those lines, our Board of Directors recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $3 billion, which now stands at $4.8 billion remaining. During our Q1 earnings call, we committed approximately $2 billion of the proceeds from H3C transaction to share repurchases. We now expect to complete roughly half of those this fiscal year with the remainder to be completed in fiscal year \u201817. As you recall, share repurchases resulting from the H3C transaction are in addition to our commitment to return 100% of our original fiscal year \u201816 free cash flow outlook to shareholders. Now, I\u2019d like to provide an update on recent M&A activity. First, we announced the sale of our majority stake in Mphasis to Blackstone, as we continue to refine our capital strategy and make improvements to our go-to-market model. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition, during the quarter, we closed the sale of 51% of H3C to Tsinghua at the beginning of May. Remember that our prior guidance did not include the impact of this transaction. We now think that we can offset the EPS impact with the share repurchases we completed in the first quarter and the incremental share repurchases to be completed later this year. Going forward, we will recognize only 49% of H3C earnings and receive a corresponding cash payment. This will reduce cash flow by approximately $200 million on the second half of fiscal year \u201816. However, roughly half of that will be received as a cash payment in fiscal year \u201817. Finally, I\u2019d like to discuss the cash impact of the ES CSC transaction to HPE. There will be no incremental one-time uses of cash beyond what we\u2019ve already communicated, around $900 million with $300 million in fiscal year \u201816 and the reminder in fiscal year \u201817. As an offset, we will reduce the $2.6 billion of restructuring payments associated with our 2015 restructuring plan by roughly $1 billion as we are achieving our targeted savings more efficiently and will no longer need to fund ES actions after the transaction closes. We have gained valuable experience in HPE, HPI separation that gives us confidence in executing the spin quickly and efficiently. In total, the fiscal year 2016 free cash flow will be reduced by $300 million due to the H3C divestiture and current year ES separation payments that will be partly offset by working capital improvements. Let\u2019s go to guidance. We expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.42 to $0.46 in Q3 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.10 to $1.14 in Q3 of 2016 and now expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the new ES separation charges and gain on sale of H3C. And we now expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Thanks Tim. Now, I\u2019d like to go into more detail on the deal we announced today with CSC, which I think will be very beneficial to customers, employees and shareholders of both companies. As today\u2019s results confirm, Enterprise Services is a stronger and more robust business than has been in many years. As a result of customer diversification efforts and other improvements, ES delivered stable constant currency revenue for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016, which were the first quarters of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth since fiscal 2012. Overall, ES is on track to achieve its long-term goal of a market competitive cost structure and operating margins. So, by bringing together the best of these two organizations, we will create a pure-play services leader ready to compete and win against all the current players. The new company will have greater agility, focus, and the ability to drive faster outcome for our customers. It will also have a top notch management team, quite literally the best in the business, and that management will be a 100% focused on ensuring a smooth transition with no disruption for ES and CSC customers. With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lawrie. Mike and I\u2019ve gotten to know each other quite well, and I can tell you he is a world class CEO with incredible talent and unbridled passion for his business. Once the deal closes, I look forward to working with him to build our new company. Mike? Mike Lawrie : Thank you, Meg. I\u2019m excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners, and investors, both at CSC and HPE\u2019s Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why. Over the past few years, our two organizations have been embarked on critical turnarounds and broad-based transformations. Not everyone is aware of this but Meg and I joined our respective companies within about six months of each other. And I\u2019m pleased to be able to say that recent years, both our organizations have been on upward trajectories with significant improvements in financial performance and in client satisfaction scores, and the progress has been real and it has been measurable. Both of our companies separated last year, within a month of one another into more client-focused pure-play entities, aimed at specific markets and core industries. And today\u2019s announcement, the coming together of these two organizations is the next logical step, building on their progress to-date and significantly accelerating their transformation. The new company will be a global top three leader in IT services, one that\u2019s uniquely positioned to lead clients in their digital transformations. Our organizations are highly complementary. HPE Enterprise Services has a proud legacy and brings focus and agility and the ability to drive faster outcomes for clients, along with the first rate sales organization. The CSC brings deep industry expertise, innovation and next generation technologies and an exceptional partner network among other strengths. And together, as an agile, technology independent services pure-play, we will be better positioned to innovate and compete and win against both emerging and established players. We will have substantial scale to serve customers more efficiently and effectively worldwide. We will have a highly competitive cost structure to take advantage of our distinct growth opportunities, resulting in the capital capacity to invest and grow, both organically and inorganically. We will strengthen and grow client relationships to cover more than three quarters of the Fortune 500 with less than 50% overlap across our top accounts. We will leverage a combined portfolio that will include leading solutions in areas like managed securities, cloud IT, enterprise applications, and big data and analytics, along with combined BPO leadership in healthcare, in insurance, in banking and capital markets. But most importantly, this great leap forward in our transformation will enable our people to better innovate to compete and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Employees will become part of a very strong and focused global enterprise that is positioned for success, one that enables them to take advantage of the diverse career development and growth opportunities of a larger global enterprise. And as a pure-play services leader, our new company will be able to operate independent of any single hardware provider, establishing the right partnerships for success. And at the same time, CSC and HPE will have long-term agreements in place to ensure that current customer commitments continue to be met and our relationship will be stronger and our collaboration deeper. Now before I hand it back to Meg, I\u2019d just like to take a moment to thank the teams at both companies for their hard work and resilience in driving our respective transformations. Through your efforts, we are in a place where we can bring our two great organizations together. That includes our team at CSC and also the HPE Enterprise Services team under Mike Nefkens. And I\u2019m pleased that Mike has agreed to stay with the company in a senior position, reporting to me and that he will be playing a crucial role in helping build and grow our new company. And I\u2019m looking forward to working with Meg as a member of the new company\u2019s Board. So, let me just reiterate my excitement about our two organizations coming together to better serve clients around the world and deliver value for our shareholders. We recognize that we\u2019re just at the beginning of this process with a lot of work to do. By staying laser focused and working in the same collaborative spirit that has gotten us to this point, we can get to the finish line faster and in a great position to launch the new company. My colleagues at CSC and I look forward to working with everyone at HP Enterprise Services. So, now, let me hand it back to you, Meg. Meg Whitman : Thank you, Mike. I look forward to a close relationship and what I believe will be a game changing new company in the global IT services market. Mike will stay with us during the Q&A portion of the call. Now, I\u2019ll open it up to questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo. Maynard Um : Meg, Can you just talk about the remaining portions of your business? It seems it\u2019s definitely more transactional. Do you anticipate that we should think about more transactions happening here, whether it\u2019s accelerated M&A or spinoffs or sale; how should we think about that? And then I have a follow-up. Meg Whitman : Well, thanks, Maynard. So, we are actually very excited about what would become a standalone Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Our focus is going to be on next gen software defined infrastructure with a world class portfolio of servers, storage, networking, converged infrastructure, hyper-converged, Helion -- our Helion cloud platform and our software assets. And you probably have guessed by now that I am now a devotee [ph] of focus. And this is going to be a laser light focused company that as I think you know is higher growth, higher margin with more robust free cash flows. And it\u2019s going to be well-capitalized. So, we don\u2019t necessarily think there is a need for acquisitions. But, if we find the right companies, we certainly will move. And let me just recap the kind of acquisitions that have worked well for this company in the past. Complimentary technologies that we can put through our excellent distribution and support system, so think 3PAR; 3Com; Aruba, all three of those acquisitions have been fantastic for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And so, we will keep our eyes out for those kinds of acquisitions. Unfortunately there aren\u2019t a lot of those around, but to the extent we see them, we won\u2019t hesitate to move. And as Tim said, remember, our capital allocation strategy is returns based. Right now, we really think there is incredible value in our stock price. And Tim announced, we\u2019re going to be buying back -- using a 100% of our free cash flow, in addition to half of the H3C proceeds. And we just got an increase and authorization of share buyback from our Board. Maynard Um : And then, just on the margin outlook for ES and servers, how should we be thinking -- should we be thinking more along the lines of 7% to 9% margins now for the ES business and low teens digits on the server side? Thank you. Sorry, the EG Group. Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. I would say on ES, as we talked about, we feel much more comfortable at the 7% range for this year. Again, we have a lot of momentum in that business, a lot of the activities that the team has done through the transformation are starting to see through to the P&L. So, 7% and 9% is what we would have; it may be conservative. But again, we need to get some, continue to execute and there is more work to do there. So, we\u2019re prudent at the 7% to 9%. On the EG front, margins were down about 240 basis points. That\u2019s primarily driven by foreign exchange, some Tier 1 mix and to a lesser degree the R&D investments we\u2019ve made. We are a little bit heavy in Tier 1 right now. If you recall, we launched the cloud line, product line where we\u2019re seeing a lot of momentum; we launched that in the second half of last year. So, we\u2019re a little bit heavier weighted in Tier 1; we expect that to normalize in the second half. I think margins there will be stable in the near term. And if you look longer term, we may even see some expansion or we would expect to see some expansion, as you think about further growth in Aruba, converged storage and those types of areas. Meg Whitman : And then, Maynard, don\u2019t forget about when we get to March 31st of 2017, the combined company of CSC and our Enterprise Services division, we announced $1.5 billion of synergies in -- on an ongoing basis, and we are really confident of that. And Mike, I might just ask you to comment on what you think in terms of the synergies of the new company. Mike Lawrie : Yes. We\u2019ve taken a pretty deep look at this and have categorized this. So, we feel that we really have got a very actionable plan that we could begin to execute, once we close the transaction at the end of the March. So Meg, I think that number is a very strong number. Operator : The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I have a couple of questions related to services and transaction. I guess the first question is why now Meg. The business has a lot of momentum in terms of profit improvement. I understand the $8.5 billion consideration, but this business is going to earn over a $1 billion in net income this year, could be closer to a $1.3 billion a $1.4 billion going forward. So, you are ascribing a value of 6.5 to 8 times to that business when operating profit under your previous plan would have been growing pretty healthily. So, I guess the question is why now, when you are kind of at the cusp of improvement, and arguably could have gotten paid for that in your stock price and how did you determine the value? And I have a follow-up please. Meg Whitman : Yes, sure. So, we are actually very pleased with the turnaround that we have executed in Enterprise Services. And I would say the time is right now, because we believe this industry actually will consolidate. And it\u2019s better to be on the front end of the consolidation play than the bank end of the consolidation play. And while there is more margin expansion here, we actually think the ability to accelerate the turnaround of ES will happen in the combined entity of CSC and ES. And recall that our shareholders will own 50% of this new entity, so they will be party to that 50% of the synergies, 50% of the operational improvements, 50% of the synergy improvement. So, in some ways, the shareholders get the best of both worlds. They get to maintain a position in Hewlett Packard Enterprise in a more focused software defined data center and edge strategy, and they get to ride the upside, half the upside that they would have gotten had it stayed with us. And my view is the upside will be bigger with CSC and ES together. And I guess the other reason is why now is the business in a good position, two years ago, we were struggling in this business; we\u2019ve diversified the revenue; we\u2019ve taken cost out; revenue has stabilize; we\u2019ve developed some new product lines. And I think combined with CSC, it\u2019s going to be a powerhouse IT services company. Toni Sacconaghi : And just a follow-up along those lines, Meg. So, I\u2019m trying to understand what would really be incremental from the merger. So, you would outline 30,000-person headcount reduction as part of your original ES plan and gross savings of $2.7 billion. And so, I\u2019d like to understand when the deal is consummated, how much of that will have been captured. And then is the $1.5 billion you\u2019re talking about just the continuation of what was already in the plan or is it truly incremental? Because at least by my math, a lot of it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s incremental, because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be done with your original restructuring plan by March 31, 2017? Meg Whitman : So, we will not be done with the entire restructuring plan, but will be done with a big chunk of it, basically probably, I would say 60% of it, maybe almost 70% of it. And that $1.5 billion of synergy is incremental. And if things like -- between the two companies 95 datacenters. Okay, we definitely do not need 95 datacenters. Multiple offshore locations and delivery centers; we will be able to consolidate delivery centers and leverage our position in India and China and Costa Rica and other places. We will be able to leverage our selling teams that will be able to I think do more in the context of this combined entity. So, our estimate is this $1.5 billion of synergies is completely incremental and we\u2019re probably 60% to 70% of the way through the transformation and the cost reduction. Operator : The next question is from Sherri Scribner at Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thanks. I was hoping a little more detail on the impact of the H3C divestiture on the second half results. Primarily is it going to show up in terms of lower revenue in the networking number or should we also see an impact to servers and storage from that divestiture? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. You\u2019ll see that in the second half. It\u2019s about $0.05. We\u2019re estimating most of that is from operating profit. There is some standard costs that we need to take out now that the deal is close. You will see most of that show up in the networking and a little bit in TS as well. Sherri Scribner : Okay. But on the revenue side will mostly be on the networking? Tim Stonesifer : Correct. Sherri Scribner : And then\u2026 Meg Whitman : Will be much impact at all to servers or storage or converged infrastructure or the Helion cloud platform or our software or frankly ES. Sherri Scribner : Okay, perfect. And then thinking about the divestiture of the services business, how will you structure your private cloud solutions going forward; will they sit on the HPE side; will they sit on the new business side; and how will you offer those solutions to your customers? Meg Whitman : Yes. So, the Helion cloud platform as whole will sit on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise side. So for example, private cloud, we\u2019re the world\u2019s leader in private cloud in our Helion cloud system platform that is built on open stack. And then of course the software business around CSA and other products in terms of one point of [indiscernible] to manage a multi-cloud environment, will sit with Hewlett Packard Enterprise. However, virtual private cloud and managed private cloud is today delivered by ES and in the future will be delivered by CSC ES. And we\u2019re going to be working very closely together to make sure that there is a seamless offering in the marketplace when someone wants a private cloud plus VPC or MPC. And then obviously, we have a relationship with Azure, and CSC has relationship with AWS. So, the new company will be able to offer both to customers, which I think is going to be a real benefit. Mike, do you want add anything to that? Mike Lawrie : I think that\u2019s the real benefit as we\u2019re going to be able to provide to our clients a wide range of solutions. I\u2019m anxious to be able to get access to some of the investments that Meg, you and the Company have made over the last couple of years, because you\u2019ve got some leading solutions and that all can be brought now to our customers through the sales force and the delivery forces that we have as a result of the combined companies. Operator : The next question is from Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Tim, can you just clarify the free cash flow guidance for this year; should subtract the $300 million from the $2 billion to $2.2 billion range or do you expect to offset some of that $300 million hit? And then, what is the normalized free cash flow with all the divestitures in comparison to that $3.7 billion number that you talked about at the Analyst Day? And I have a follow-up. Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. So, we are reducing the guide from 2 to 2.2, down to 1.7 to 1.9, so that is a new guide for the year. And if you think about that, it\u2019s really three components. There is $200 million of pressure from the H3C divestiture, so that does not show up in our free cash flow. There is about $300 million that are related to the separation cost now for the ES transaction. And then those will be partially offset by working capital improvement. So, we continue to see a momentum, particularly if you look at extended payment terms, if you look at just being a little bit more disciplined around payment exceptions and things of that nature. So, net-net, we will reduce the guide by $300 million. I think about it as primarily driven by the H3C divestiture. From a normalized perspective, I would say normalized would probably be around maybe 3.5, north of 3.5, 3.8, something like that. Katy Huberty : And then, Meg, one of the reasons HP originally purchased EDS [ph] was the potential of revenue synergies as that business pulled more HP systems and software. As you look to separate those businesses, are there revenue dissynergies that we should now think about? Thanks. Meg Whitman : We don\u2019t believe that that will be the case. You are right, one of the predicates of the EDS acquisitions was pull through of our infrastructure business as well as our software business. And by the way that has been realized. So, we\u2019ve got a commercial agreement with the new company CSC ES that will keep those level of pull-through the same for three years. Now, we hope we will actually be able to do more with CSC because we haven\u2019t really had access to their book of business, and they\u2019ve got a very strong business. And as Mike said, they are interested in our products and software, and we have to go in and earn that business. But that\u2019s one of the things that we intend to do. So, at a very minimum, base line will be maintained and there is an upside in terms of earning more business with CSC. Operator : The next question is from Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Brian Alexander : Could you just clarify whether you are still expecting constant currency revenue growth for all of fiscal \u201816, adjusting for the H3C divestiture? And if so, how do you think the second half will compare to the first half? Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : Sure, yes. We do still expect to see revenue growth for the total year in constant currency. The one thing that I would say is that the growth rates will be a little bit more normalized, if you will; in the second half, there would be less FX pressure as an example. Because again, if you look at the second quarter, most of that FX pressure was driven by the hedge gains that we received in the second quarter of last year that didn\u2019t repeat this year. So that will tend to normalize. So, we expect to grow, but it would be a little bit more muted I would say versus the first half because again the compares get a little bit tougher too as well in the second half. Operator : The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : My question is for Meg. Meg, you mentioned early on that you are devotee I think of focus, and we\u2019ve seen HP go from being a $100 billion business to a $50 billion business, now a $33 billion business. My question would be then why would the remaining assets, do they really belong together, have any thought been given around optimizing the remaining portfolio further? For example, I think most people would understand that you have a reasonably sub scale software business; does that really belong with HP Enterprise. Have you thought about tuning even further going forward or do you think this is really the asset base and technology base at HP Enterprise required to thrive long-term? Meg Whitman : Yes. So, we are happy with the performance of the overall portfolio. You saw the growth in EG, Software grew in constant currency when you normalize for M&A. And when you think about the software defined datacenter, I\u2019m really quite happy with the performance of the assets. So, obviously over time, we continue to ensure that we\u2019ve got the right set of assets. Someone earlier on the call asked whether we would do M&A or some divestiture. So, we are going to continue to optimize the set of assets that we have but we are really happy with the current portfolio. Operator : The next question is from Rod Hall with J.P. Morgan. Rod Hall : I guess I have two. One, I wanted to see if you guys could walk us through that -- you said 4.5 billion of equity values, I think for 50% in the new entity. Can you just walk us through your contemplation on that; how you\u2019re getting there? And then the second question, I wanted to go back to the synergies question. And whether you think there will be any revenue dissynergy, is there overlap in revenues that would create some dissynergy there that we should be netting against the $1.5 billion incremental? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes. So, I\u2019ll get Mike Lawrie to address the revenue dissynergies. I mean, he mentioned that -- we have a very small overlap of customers, only 15%, but he might talk about that. Mike Lawrie : Yes, we just don\u2019t see that much dissynergy here with the -- when we went through the top 200 accounts with less than 15% overlap. So, it\u2019s really two different customers. And so when we think about it, it makes a lot of sense because many of our losses were HPE gains and vice versa, was mostly losses on our side. So, when you think about it, it really is truly a new market opportunity for us, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t think there will be many revenue dissynergies and why there is such an opportunity to expand the business that we\u2019re doing together. Meg Whitman : And then, let me walk you through at a high level the deal mechanics, and then I\u2019ll ask Chris Hsu who is our Chief Operating Officer, who helped negotiated this deal, to give a bit more detail. So, we started out with what is the value of the enterprise services asset. And as you saw from the release, the headline value there is $8.5 billion. Now, we wanted to make sure that we did a 50-50 merger of equals tax-free spin merge of Enterprise Services into this new entity. And so, obviously, we made some -- we negotiated some adjustments to that. So first of all, the new company, and I\u2019m sort of calling it for short hand CSCES, will pay Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the future standalone Hewlett Packard Enterprise $1.5 billion of cash, after the deal closes, and will assume $2.5 billion of liability, pension liability as well as old EDS [ph] $300 million bond. And then ES or Hewlett Packard Enterprise will actually subsidize some of that pension liability with offshore cash. So, Chris, do you want to add any more detail to that? Chris Hsu : Sure, Meg. Meg you hit the most of the high point. We started with negotiating, like Meg said, $8.5 billion. And at the time that we did the value, the equity value of CSC was about $4.6 billion, and we then developed in order to get the 50-50 merger of equals to make this tax free spin under an RMT [p] structure. We then developed a set of upfront considerations that Meg went through, with the cash dividend and then some transfer of liabilities. So that was roughly $3.9 billion. So, the two components of $3.9 billion of upfront consideration, plus $4.6 billion of equity considerations in CSC stock, essentially makes up the $8.5 billion in total valuation. Now the equity considerations that CSC will essentially issue stock at the time of the transaction and that stock will essentially result in the company being 50-50. And price or the total value at the time of the close will depend on where CSC is trading at that point in time. Operator : The next question is from Steve Milunovich at UBS. Steve Milunovich : I wanted to go back to this question about the pull-through. I\u2019d think that ES -- well some of it\u2019s very independent, would have pulled through a fair amount of your EG business, particularly as we move more to cloud. And I\u2019d like you to talk a bit more about the commitments that you have. Are you the favorite hardware supplier for the new company? And I guess part of the point of being a pure services company is that they are fairly agnostic. And so, do you lose that over time? So, it\u2019s not obvious to me that you absolutely maintain what you have and it\u2019s just a question if it gets better. I\u2019m a little worried obviously about whether it could get worse. And then, conversely, what is getting rid of the services business or half of it, do for you on the HPE side, what can you do now that you weren\u2019t able to do previously? Meg Whitman : Sure. So, actually, we\u2019re very -- this was a very important part of the deal because the last thing I wanted to do was combine CSC with ES and then lose the infrastructure pull-through. That would not have been a value to Hewlett Packard Enterprise. So, we\u2019ve negotiated a deal that I think is very fair. It allows CSC to continue to work with people they\u2019ve worked with in the past, but we\u2019ve also got a commitment from them for the next three years. Beyond that, I am very confident that the work we will do in Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn our way to that commitment. I mean think about our server lineup, our storage lineup, our networking lineup, our wired, wireless LAN lineup, our converged infrastructure, hyper converged and Helion cloud platform, but we do have, if you will, a safety net for the next three years. But, I also -- one of the benefits of a pure-play services company is to be able to work with best of breed. And I know Mike wants to continue to do that. So, I think we\u2019ve struck a good thing that protects us in the near term but gives Mike the flexibility he needs to do solutions that are right for his customers. On the other side of it is, we do business today with some of ES\u2019s competitors, think about Deloitte or Accenture or Capgemini or the Indian players, and we want to continue to grow that. And they are just like -- for Mike, there is a benefit to being a pure play that will be benefit for us in terms of being, primarily a software-defined infrastructure company and software company. So, we imagine growing the business with those players as well. And by the way, this interestingly happened with the HPE, HP Inc. split. When HP Inc. became a separate company, all of a sudden, a lot of competitors who used to think they were competitors to some degree with our company, all of a sudden were very interested in the HP Inc. offering. So, we think that could happen to us as well. Operator : The next question is from Amit Daryanani at RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess, Meg, the biggest question we\u2019re getting right now is what drove the transaction at this point for you guys. And really broadly as you look at HPE post this transaction and after March 31st, what do you think your revenue growth and EPS targets would look like relative to IT spend over time? Meg Whitman : Yes. So, listen, I mean part of the benefit of this transaction is focused on a smaller number of businesses that I think play into a sweet spot in IT spend. So, the objective of standalone HPE will be all about helping customers optimize and modernize their traditional IT spend, which by the way is still 88% of the spend in the marketplace, and transition to a multi-cloud environment and also deploy obviously the software assets. So, we are not giving revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the standalone company; I\u2019m certain we will closer to March 31st. But, we expect to go at or above the market rate, as we did this quarter. I think it\u2019s important to look at our results this quarter for Enterprise Group and Software I think they are the best indication that we\u2019ve got a winning company here. We outgrew the market, we outgrew every single competitor, gained share in every single one of our -- against our infrastructure competitors. And I think what you have now is the Enterprise Group and Software on a roll. And the investments that we have made in R&D, the investments we\u2019ve made in a fire in the belly sales force. I mean we have done a transformation of our sales force around not only our channel but also direct selling. And then, if you think about how we\u2019ve optimized marketing spend over the last couple of years, we\u2019re doing better in demand [indiscernible] digital marketing than we\u2019ve ever done. So I think you\u2019ve got a little power house in software defined infrastructure and software. Operator : The next question is from Ittai Kidron at Oppenheimer. Ittai Kidron : This is Ittai, a question for Tim. Tim, I wanted to drill down a little bit into your third quarter guidance, especially on the EPS, which is below the Street, by about $0.04. How much of this is the H3C transaction? I think you talked about a $0.05 loss and is that also the reason you\u2019re looking for very fourth quarter weighted EPS upside; can you walk us through some of the elements for that variability? Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So, if you take our third quarter guide, we\u2019re at the midpoint about $0.44. The primary delta versus consensus right now is really driven by the H3C transaction to your point. That\u2019s probably about say $0.03 or $0.04. So that implies a ramp in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s really think about it in three ways, one, it\u2019s typical seasonality. So, when you look at our ES business and our Software business, those businesses tend to be back-end loaded, so that will drive a lot of the improvement. The second component is around the H3C transaction from stranded cost perspective. So now that the deal is closed, there is some overhead costs that we need to take out of the system that generally takes a little bit of time, not too dissimilar to the dissynergy story we had around the separation. And then the third component is driven by the share repurchases. So, there is more of an impact in Q4 versus Q3 on the share repurchase front. So, those are really the key drivers to the ramp in the fourth quarter. But we\u2019ve got clear plan. For sure, we need to go out and execute, but we feel good about the total year, and that\u2019s why we held our total year guide of $1.85 to $1.95. Ittai Kidron : That\u2019s great. And as a follow-up on EG margins, for two quarters in a row now, they\u2019re down on a year-over-year basis. And I understand that FX is a part of that. But how do we think about the timeline by which we go back towards the 15% range; is that even possible given the mix of solutions? And maybe you can kind of walk us through that and when does TS start contributing for this from a growth standpoint, revenue, not just margin? Tim Stonesifer : Sure. I would say from a margin perspective, for sure, FX has had a factor, has been a factor, particularly if you look at the first half of the year. And that will tend to have less of an impact going forward. We do have a heavy mix of Tier 1 right now. Again, we launched cloud line in the second half of last year. So right now, when you look at our total mix from a Tier 1 perspective, it\u2019s a little bit heavy. Again, that will tend to normalize. So, I would expect the margins in EG to be stable. And I\u2019m not going to give margin guidance here. But again, as we continue to grow Aruba, as we continue to grow storage, that\u2019s going to help the margin front. On the TS front, that business will also stabilize. So, we had -- we were down in revenue 1% in constant currency when you adjust for HPI transaction. But we do expect revenue growth in the latter part of the year. And the way to think about that is obviously that\u2019s an annuity type business given the contracts. So, what we\u2019re going to start seeing in the second half is that those negative growth orders that we had in \u201814; that\u2019s replaced by positive growth that we saw in \u201815, that\u2019s sees our 2016 revenue. So, we do expect TS revenue to be flat on a year-over-year basis for the total year and that will also help from a margin perspective as well. Operator : The next question is from Jim Suva at Citi. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations on a lot of work and the big surprise. Regarding the divestiture of H3C, aside just from the pure mechanics of selling 51% and what goes on and what the equity transactions and how accounts and financing. From a pure sales perspective, was there an impact in this quarter and impact in the next quarter as far as transactions whether there will be accelerated or deferred or anything we should think about as far as closing the transactions around the H3C transaction? Meg Whitman : I wouldn\u2019t think so, if I\u2019m understanding your question correctly. Remember now, H3C is 51% -- in China, it\u2019s 51% owned by Unisplendour, a subsidiary of Tsinghua. So, the CEO is a great guy by the name of Tony Yu, who is running the business -- or we have the Chairman and the CFO. But, it\u2019s really going to depend on the momentum in that H3C business in the China market. And what I will tell you is the momentum is really good. We had a very good second quarter there, even though the transaction hadn\u2019t closed. And I was just in China two weeks ago, and I will tell you Tsinghua is incredibly committed to this. The management team is fired up. They feel like they control their own destiny in China. And so, I can\u2019t predict what the revenue will do there, but I\u2019m feeling really good about our 49% ownership of business that I think there is a lot of commitment on behalf of Tsinghua and the management team to make successful. Jim Suva : And as a follow-up, regarding the pull-through of the -- I think you mentioned a three-year agreements with CSC. Is that just on the HP services that goes to CSC or CSC also with their other existing businesses can have in a agreement to refer HP for their products? Meg Whitman : It\u2019s really around -- so, we sell a certain amount. The Enterprise Group and Software, mostly the Enterprise Group sells a lot of their products to Enterprise Services in an intercompany transfer today. And we want to make sure that that business stays for the next three years, and we have a chance to earn more business. So, think about it as servers, storage, networking, converged infrastructure, the Helion cloud platform and TS, as well as Software. So that is how the agreement is structured. Does that answer your question? Jim Suva : Yes, it does. Thank you very much. Mike Lawrie : The other thing I would add is they are playing in a $2.5 billion ITO market today that we do not participate in. So, it may will be a growth opportunity for HPE. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Apart from the separation cost associated with this ES transaction, can you talk about any potential cost dissynergies or stranded costs associated with this deal? And I have a follow-up. Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. So, the overall separation cost will be $900 million, again $300 million of that will be incurred in 2016 and $600 million of that will be incurred -- roughly $600 million will be incurred in 2017. Again, there is no incremental onetime cash cost associated with this. We will reduce the 2015 restructuring plan by about $1 billion and that will offset the cost for here. As far as the stranded cost number, we will work those costs out through the system. I think the good news is what we\u2019ve learned in the last separation was how to do this and do it efficiently. So, I would just say on the stranded cost piece, if I look at project planning and what have you, we have that much more clearly defined. We know who owns it and we know how that\u2019s going to come out at the system and when that comes out of the system. Meg Whitman : Yes. I\u2019ll also add, I think there is a real benefit to having done one separation. The first time you do it you get the best advice you can and you learn how to do it. This time we have this thing down to a science. And so, I think a number of the same people are going to work on this separation, and I\u2019m highly confident we are going to be able to work off the stranded cost probably faster than we did in the version 1.0. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, great. As my follow-up, Tim, on normalized free cash flow, given the higher transactional nature of the business post ES, I\u2019m a little surprised, you have a fairly tight range of 3.5 to 3.8 if I heard you right. How should we think about the volatility of that number, and then just longer term, normalized CapEx spend for HPE in a post ES world? Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : Yes, let me just clarify. The 3.5 to 3.8; that was \u201816 with ES. And so, if you are looking to pull ES out from a normalized perspective, that\u2019s not what I was talking about. I was talking about sort of our current guide with current separation, current restructuring, what have you. In general, if you strip out ES, I think about obviously ES has more CapEx than the other businesses from a normalized CapEx perspective. I think you could see our CapEx go down by $500 million or $600 million. That\u2019s what we typically use for ES. So, that\u2019s sort of how I think about it from a normalized perspective. Again, we\u2019ll give some more color when we do SAM in October, but I think CapEx is the big driver. Meg Whitman : As I said, I think what we are doing by the announcements we made today is unlocking the value of these two companies. And remember EG, plus Software, plus our Financial Services business is a faster growing higher margin more robust free cash flow business. And I think now that with a super focused mission, we\u2019re going to see some real benefits there. And then, obviously by consolidating CSC with ES, I think we are going to get real cost synergies there. Operator : The next question is from Simona Jankowski at Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : Thank you very much, maybe just the last question then on the fundamentals that you\u2019re seeing out there. It sounded like you attribute the strong performance in EG mostly to share gains, but can you also comment on the demand environment? And then, just relative to those share gains, you touched a little bit on what drove that such as retooling the sales force et cetera. Can you just comment in a little bit more detail on any other factors driving your success there, whether it\u2019s related to solution selling or pricing or products, anything of that nature? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Sure. So, listen, it is an uneven macroeconomic environment, I think Tim said that out first. And so, different countries sort of go up and down, different regions. But overall, I think we feel very comfortable with our position in the traditional IT market and then in our ability to provide solutions in a multi-cloud environment. So, I think demand can go up and down but our objective is in whatever the market is doing, we want to make sure we at least hold our gain share and we did that in the last quarter. And I don\u2019t think there is anything new to add as to why. First of all, I think the R&D investments that we\u2019ve made over the last four years are paying off. So, the development cycle in servers, storage, networking, those kind of things, hyper converge, these are long term investments. What you started three years ago actually comes to market now or even next year. So, that investment in R&D is paying off. And I would tell you, a dollar spent on internal R&D is the best dollar we spend at HP, it\u2019s fantastic. Second is, when you retool a sales force that takes some time as well. And I would say, we\u2019re much farther along that we have been, and there is more work to do. And then, as I said, marketing, we\u2019ve retooled on our entire demand generation, we\u2019ve retooled -- and by the way, the launch of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gave us a chance to tell people the story of the enterprise side of this business, because prior to that if you had asked man on the street what is HP, they\u2019d say printing and PC company. So, I think that\u2019s actually been beneficial. And then, turn around could take five years; it\u2019s that when I started and we\u2019re rounding the bend into the end of the fifth year. And so it\u2019s gratifying that we saw as reported growth for the first time in five years. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Simona. I think that wraps up today\u2019s call. Meg Whitman : Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

My name is Aaronson and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andrew Simanek : Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And I\u2019d like to welcome you to our Fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings and transaction materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions please refer to HPE\u2019s SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates presented beginning with fiscal year 2015, are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps to provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance given the significant divestitures we have recently completed including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details. With that, let me turn it over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying I am pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and technology services. Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in enterprise services and focus on profitable deals in the enterprise group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate was at the high-end of our previously guided range. Free cash flow also improved to $1 billion through diligent working capital management and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. Tim will provide further color on the quarter, but I would like to take the bulk of my time to discuss today\u2019s spin-merge announcement and put it in the context of the strategy, we\u2019ve been executing against for the past several years. Last November, we launched the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the vision to become the industry\u2019 leading provider hybrid IT with the secure next generation software defined infrastructure that will run our customer\u2019s data centers today, bridge them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and enable the emerging intelligent adds that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come. We believe this is what our customers are looking for and what we are best qualified to do. And most importantly achieving this vision will create a faster growing, higher margin, stronger free cash flow company for our shareholders. To realize our vision, we looked at our portfolio and our product roadmaps to determine gaps that we needed to fill and then evaluated how best to do so. Some we filled through increased R&D like the investment in our recently launched HC 380 Hyper Converged product in other areas we pursue innovative partnerships like the ones recently announced with Docker and Mesosphere. And in some cases acquisitions make sense like Aruba and SGI. Next, we identified areas of the business that were not aligned with our go forward strategy. There we had look at how to best maximize shareholder value with these assets. We\u2019ve already made a number of decisions including the sale of TippingPoint, the H3C deal in China and of course the spin-merge of our enterprise services business with CSC. And today, we announced plans for a spin-off and merger of our non-core software assets with Micro Focus. These assets include our application delivery management, big data, enterprise security, information management and governance and IT operations management businesses. This transaction is valued at about 8.8 billion including a 50.1% ownership of the new combined company by HPE shareholders, which is currently valued at $6.3 billion and a $2.5 billion cash payment to HPE. The combined company will be led by Kevin Loosemore, current Micro Focus Executive Chairman and Mike Phillips will serve as Chief Financial Officer. After the transaction closes, Micro Focus\u2019s Board of Directors will include an HPE Senior Executive and HP Independent Directors on the Board. The new combined company is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $4.5 billion with strong recurring revenue streams. The company will be well diversified across product lines and geographies. It'll also have a stronger go-to-market capability with nearly 4,000 sales people worldwide and deep R&D resources to deliver best-in-class solutions to customers and partners. Micro Focus's approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas like Big Data Analytics and security while maintaining a stable platform for mission critical software products that customers rely on. For employees Micro Focus's approach will mean each product line will have a clear and important role in the overall company performance and employees will have a high level of clarity on the strategy for their organization. It also means employees will get to work on long-term customer focused projects and the software technology that they love. We believe the software assets that will be a part of the spin-merge will bring better value to our customers, employees and shareholders as part of a more focused software company committed to growing these businesses on a standalone basis. With this announcement, Robert Youngjohns, the current head of our software business will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Development, reporting to me. In this new role Robert will partner with other members of the leadership team to drive strategic customer and partner initiatives focused on growing key parts of the business. With Robert taking on this new role, Chris Hsu, our Chief Operating Officer will lead the software business effective immediately in addition to his current responsibilities. Chris's track record of driving strong performance and understanding market dynamics at HPE and throughout his career making him a great fit for this role. To be clear both software and services are still key enablers of HPE's go forward strategy. Our newly created software defined and cloud business will build upon key software assets like OneView and the Helion Cloud platform to deliver software defined hybrid IT solutions like synergy. HPE's composable infrastructure offering that enables customers to operate their workloads with unprecedented speed and agility. And in services we continue to have a world class capability in our technology services group which will represent about 25% of HPE's revenue following the two spins that we've announced. ES\u2019 22,000 service professionals build solutions from the ground up with the consulting and support our customers need to transform their environments and take advantage of opportunities in emerging areas like campus, branch and IoT. Once the ES CSC and the software of Micro Focus transactions are complete HPE will be an even stronger company, well positioned for the future. With approximately $28 billion in annual revenue the future HPE will have significant scale, a diversified world class portfolio and a global footprint to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. We'll be a market leader both in the data center and on the edge with our world class portfolio of software defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure. We'll also have strong recurring revenue streams that account for approximately 60% of our operating profit and we'll have an improved free cash flow profile. Given our experience with divestitures we're confident in our ability to execute and more importantly that we're making the right choices to set both HPE and our customers up for the long term while delivering maximum shareholder value. The market is already recognizing what we're doing. With these strategic moves and our continued strong operational performance HPE's market cap has increased by over $10 billion or 40% since separation from HPI on November 01, 2015. In addition to the portfolio changes we also made important leadership and organizational changes this quarter that will make our business stronger and more efficient. For example, we started the process of rightsizing our corporate functions for the more focused standalone HPE. In addition, the enterprise group businesses have been simplified and streamlined to better address market opportunities, improve cost structure, accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitiveness. Furthermore, all business unit and corporate marketing efforts will be consolidated under our global marketing function and all sales will be under a single global leader. Finally we announced the Hewlett Packard labs would move into the enterprise group which will better align our research and go-to-market efforts. While there is more work to do, we're already seeing that our strategy is working. As a more focused organization we've been better able to allocate resources more effectively and introduce truly best-in-class solutions. For example, as I mentioned earlier, we announced plans to acquire SGI. High performance compute and big data analytics are exciting areas for us as customers are increasingly looking for ways to gain deeper, a more contextual insights from the ever expanding volumes of data. Industries like financial services, semiconductors and energy are all increasing their HPC investments. In Q3, we won several significant automotive deals where high performance compute is used for electronic prototype designs, improving fuel economy and improving crash worthiness. The SGI acquisition will further strengthen our position in the $11 billion HPC segment as well as the high growth data analytics segment. In storage, we extended our leadership in the all-flash data center with enhancements to HPE 3PAR and also introduced next generation software defined storage to enable a compassable data fabric. We also brought enterprise capabilities to the entry storage market with the introduction of StoreVirtual 3200 and in MSA 2040. We announced HPE OneView 3.0 to provide software defined intelligence across HPE\u2019s family of infrastructure solutions. To-date, we have sold over 500,000 HPE OneView licenses across a variety of key verticals such as healthcare, industrial and financial services, and we have a growing partner ecosystem including Docker, Shaft, Turbonomic and Self Tech. We unveiled the industry's first converge systems for the Internet-of-things the HPE Edgeline 1000 and 4000 which will enable real-time decision making and deliver heavy duty analytics at the edge by integrating data capture, control, compute and storage. We also announced updates to the HPE Helion cloud portfolio including HPE Helion cloud Suite, a new software suite enabling customers to manage their full spectrum of applications across infrastructure environments and HPE Hellion Cloud System 10 a hardware and software solution to build and deploy an enterprise grade private cloud environment. But most of all we're winning with our customers and partners. Aruba continues to win customers and drive growth with its industry leading technology. For example, we helped Rio's airport handle the massive surge of travelers passing through for the Olympics this summer and Home Depot and Best Buy are currently implementing Aruba wireless solutions to provide a better in-store experience for customers and employees. Keep in mind that deals like this have great TS pull through as well. As discovered in June, we announced a new partnership with GE Digital that will enable industrial analytics from the edge to the cloud. HPE will be a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's Predix Cloud technologies and the Predix platform will be a preferred software solution for HPE\u2019s industrial related used cases and opportunities. HPE was also instrumental in helping Dropbox transform to a hybrid infrastructure to help it meet the growing bands of its users. Dropbox moved the majority of its cloud storage business away from AWS to on-premise data center using HPE ProLiant and Cloudline servers all financed by HPE Financial Services. We also announced a groundbreaking strategic alliance with Docker to help customer transform and modernize their data centers to benefit from a more agile development environment. At the heart of this alliance is HPE's Docker ready server program, unique to the server industry which ensures HPE servers are bundled with the Docker engine and support. And today we announced plans for a commercial partnership with Micro Focus that will name SUSE as HPE's preferred Linux partner and will bring together HPEs' Helion OpenStack and Stackato solutions with SUSE's OpenStack expertise to provide best in class enterprise grade hybrid cloud offerings for HPE customers. So in summary, I am pleased with the progress we have made this quarter and I am just as pleased with the execution of our strategy since we separated from HPI. I am also excited about the opportunities we have created for shareholders in the spin-mergers of ES and CSC and our software assets with Micro Focus. We are setting up HPE for long term success while unlocking the kind of value we believe our shareholders appreciate. On that note, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Tim. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks Meg. Overall we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion down less than 1% was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focused on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficult compares across the portfolio in an uneven global demand environment. As we indicated last quarter, compares became more challenging as we are no longer benefitting from the large Deutsche Bank deal we signed in ES last year, and an EG, we are lapping the compares from Aruba and the ramp of Cloudline servers. From a micro perspective, we did see weakness in Europe, particularly in ES from a slowing in the UK public sector business and also in Japan in the enterprise group. The Q3 currency impact to revenue was a headwind of 210 basis points year-over-year that we expect to moderate further. We did have several areas of solid growth across the portfolio including networking up 12%, all-flash arrays up 70%, higher performance compute up 12%, and our highest margin business technology services returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. To improve growth in the overall portfolio, we are continuing to make investments in our higher growth businesses around software defined, converge and hyper converge. While we continue to enhance our go to market efforts that we expect will improve growth going forward. Overall we are still on track to deliver what we said we would do at the beginning of the year by growing total fiscal year '16 revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency. Gross margin of 29.3% was up 60 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially, this was principally due to continued improvements in enterprise services and enterprise group to a lesser extent. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.8% was up 30 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 was above our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 that was primarily the result of tax benefits realized to the recent divestitures, equating to approximately $0.04 per share. Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pre-tax amounts for the gain on divestitures of H3C of $2.2 billion, restructuring charges of $369 million, amortization of intangible assets of $210 million and separation charges of $135 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.32 above our previously provided outlook range of $1.10 to $1.14, primarily due to a higher than expecting gain on H3C divestiture, lower separation costs and the previously mentioned tax benefit. Now turning to the results by business. In enterprise group revenue was flat as we focused on profitability and delivered encouraging improvements in operating margins, which while flat year-over-year were up 90 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to lower discounting, better server option attach, favorable mix and operational cost improvements as we right size the organization ahead of the separation from enterprise services and software. Server revenue declined 2% as solid growth in Tier 1 and high performance compute was offset by pressures in core servers. Within the core we did have some market coverage issues that we are addressing through recent sales leadership and go to market changes with an emphasis on SMB. We also doubled down in the fast growing high performance compute market with the acquisition of SGI and continue to invest in workload optimized solutions like SAP HANA. From a margin standpoint, the team did a nice job prioritizing profitability over share for shares\u2019 sake expanding margins year-over-year. We also anticipate we held server share in the second calendar quarter overall and gained share in the Americas essentially optimized in Tier 1. Storage revenue declined 5% with continued declines in the legacy portfolio more than offsetting growth in converged storage of 1% that was impacted by a softer than expected market. Margins increased year-over-year driven by favorable converge mix and improved pricing in all-flash. 3PAR, plus XP, plus CVA was up 5% and all-flash 3PAR revenue continued to drive the portfolio growing 70% at record revenue levels. Despite a challenging market, we estimate we gain share in the second calendar quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of share gains. And we continue to expect storage to gain shares through the remainder of the year. Networking revenue grew 12% and encouragingly Aruba growth has accelerated growing 20% and is exceeding our internal plan. We again saw growth across all regions as we continue to see the benefits of the combined Aruba HPE portfolio. Margins improved year-over-year driven by both a better mix and higher margin rates of Aruba. TS returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. Revenue was up 1% as the strong order growth from fiscal year 2015 becomes a larger portion of the portfolio and revenue grew in both support and in consulting. And while orders were flat, we saw encouraging performance in non-attached and proactive services that are growing at double-digit rates and becoming a larger mix of the total portfolio. We continue to improve service intensity our attached dollars per unit which is helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and higher server ASPs. Enterprise services revenue declined 3% as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by weakness in EMEA resulting from a pause in UK public sector spending and a tough compare with the Deutsche Bank deal in the prior year. Operating profit improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%, the highest since the second quarter of 2011 as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements and delivery in sales. We also benefited from improving location mix and new deal profitability. Progress made on cost improvements, sale strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with continued confidence that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 7% at the high end of our original outlook. Revenue is still expected to be down 2% to flat in constant currency even with the Mphasis divestiture. We continue to track against our longer term goal of 60% headcount in low cost locations and completed the quarter with 49% of our headcount in low cost centers, a six point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. Software revenue declined 3% as strength in security and big data was offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a record quarter with 17% revenue growth. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls decreasing OpEx 16% year-over-year. However, revenue declines ultimately outpaced operating improvements causing a 270 basis point decline in operating margins to 17.8%. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered the first quarter of as reported revenue growth since the first quarter of 2013. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 9.9% as lower residual sales from weaker volume and prior year\u2019s pressured margin rates. Financing volume decline 4% year-over-year in constant currency, on a tough compare that saw Deutsche Bank sale leaseback volume in the third quarter of 2015. Return on equity was down 190 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% and was similarly pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year \u201913 and fiscal year \u201914. Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to optimize working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $971 million, up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sale of Mphasis, the cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 5 days, sequentially. Receivables where the largest contributor to working capital improvement due to favorable payment term mix and reductions to aged receivables. Going forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-teens with fiscal year \u201916 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock during an accelerated share repurchase program and we paid $91 million as part of our normal dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders. Primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. With our free cash flow generation and the recent divestitures, we are on pace to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in the year, which as a reminder is approximately three times our original commitment at the start of the year. Finally, I would like to discuss the financial impacts of the HPE software and Micro Focus transaction. As Meg mentioned, the transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.8 billion of enterprise value to HPE. This includes 50.1% of the equity in the newly formed company that will go to HPE shareholders. Valued at approximately $6.3 billion based on Micro Focus\u2019s current stock price and receipt of a $2.5 billion payment of onshore cash to HPE. HPE Micro Focus also expect to improve the margins on HPE software assets by approximately 20 points by the end of the third year following the deal close, while investing in key growth areas like big data and security. As owners of 50.1% of the equity in the new merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of these operational improvements, as well as future growth of earnings. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the second half of HPE\u2019s fiscal year 2017. To recognize this $8.8 million of enterprise value and unlock a more attractive financial profile for HPE going forward. We will incur one-time separation cash payments of approximately $700 million with the vast majority occurring in fiscal year \u201917. Following the separation from ES and Software Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a faster growing higher margin, stronger cash flow company for our shareholders. Just looking at fiscal year \u201916, revenue growth would be about 3 points greater, operating margins would be about 1 point higher at just over 10% and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue would be roughly 50% higher. It\u2019s also worth noting that we have roughly 30% of revenue recurring, but most importantly more than 60% of profitability will be recurring that comes from ES and Financial Services. HPE will also have a very healthy balance sheet that currently sits at $5.3 billion in operating net cash. On top of that we just closed the Mphasis deal receiving approximately $825 million of before tax cash proceeds. We continue to see share repurchase as an excellent use of capital and similar to the H3C transaction plan to buy back shares with the vast majority of the Mphasis proceeds. In fiscal year '17 our net cash position will also be further enhanced by over a $1 billion from the cash and debt transfers with CSC and the $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. We'll continue to deliver shareholder value with these proceeds just as we've done this year by following our returns based capital allocation approach. This approach is currently biased towards share repurchases and we'll provide more details on our fiscal year '17 capital return plan to shareholders at our upcoming Analyst Day. With all that in mind we expect to finish fiscal year 2016 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of a $1.90 to $1.95 at the high end of our original outlook for the year, we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $2.09 to $2.14. Before we open it up to questions a quick reminder that we're holding our Annual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 18th in San Francisco where we'll provide additional P&L and cash flow details on the company as it stands today as well as the go forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise excluding ES and software. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : The slowdown in storage was a bit of a surprise given that most other players in this space beat expectations, so just to begin I wonder if you could talk about what you think drove that, was it macro or execution? And then I've a follow-up. Meg Whitman : So, the storage performance was not as strong in Q3 as we saw last quarter I think because there was a weaker margin -- I mean weaker market, but we also increased margins and we expect to take about a 0.5 point of share year-over-year in the second quarter. And I want to remind you this is the 11th straight quarter in the row that we've taken market share and revenue was down 5% year-over-year, adjusted for divestitures and the currency as traditional declined 12% more than offsetting the 1% growth in converged. So, listen, we saw a softer market and but we've introduced our new StoreVirtual 3200, the MSA 2040 that brings the Enterprise capabilities at a fantastic price to the entry market and that has been a drag for us, we haven't had a great competitive offering in the entry market and what you know about the storage market, it's moving from high end to mid to entry very-very fast. So, looking forward I mean listen, we think the market is going to continue to be soft, but -- and that will keep overall market -- our growth muted, but we continue to gain share and we're very pleased with our HPE 3PAR all-flash performance that grew 70% year-over-year. So, some work to do there, but we feel good about where we are and on a go forward basis I think you'll see us return to growth, a bit more robust growth. Katy Huberty : And through the July quarter you've essentially met your objective to return the 100% of free cash flow plus half of the H3C cash to shareholders, how should we think about the balance of additional buyback versus extenuating the Remanco portfolio of products after the two spin-merge deals. Tim Stonesifer : So, we did the $1.5 billion in the ASR in the third quarter, so there will be some shares taken out in the fourth quarter as we complete that, as that was a six month program. I think looking forward we will have nice cash balances particularly as we close these transactions, so we're going to continue to execute our disclaimed ROI based approach. We think it has worked well so far. At the same time, we will consider some acquisitions right. SGI is a great example of complementary technology in the high performance compute data analytics space that we should benefit from a profitable growth perspective. So right now we\u2019ll stick with the ROI based approach and we'll obviously share more details with you on 2017 at next month's Analyst Meeting. Meg Whitman : People always asked us what kind of acquisitions work well HPE and I think we\u2019ve got the formula down which is, what is complementary technology in the HPE strategy of being leading provider of hybrid IT with secured next generation software defined infrastructure. And also at the edge. So Aruba and SGI are perfect examples, complementary technology that we can put through our distribution center that really -- our distribution mechanism that really enhances value for customers. So I think those is a two perfect examples of the kind of deals you could see us do going forward. Unfortunately there aren't that many deals like that, but when they come along we'll do them. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Meg, a year ago you were out on the road show talking about the split of HPE, what is now HPE and HPQ and at that time you talked about cash balance being an asset and that acquisitions will be an integral part of the strategy, you also talked about HPE being a solution's company and a growth company. Less than a year later, it feels like a different story. Cash return has been the absolute priority acquisitions have been extremely minimal, arguably divesting software and services which are essentially ingredients to many solutions seems different. And so I applaud the flexibility because the stock price has done extremely well and it's certainly been in the vein of value creation. But I was wondering if you could comment on what appeared to precipitous this change in thinking from, I think an impression that seemed different to most from the road show a year ago and is there a different end state for Hewlett Packard Enterprise going forward. I mean is this really a viable ongoing hardware centric company going forward or should we expect more portfolio rationalization? And believe it or not I have a follow-up. Meg Whitman : So, let me take you all the way back to November 1st of 2015, where we separated HP Inc from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And we very much laid out the strategy of beating a leading provider in hybrid IT both in the traditional data center, which by the way is still a robust market, it's 85% of the spend in IT today and we are the leader there and we need to continue to gain share. And then we wanted to focus on software defined infrastructure which is really the next generation of the infrastructure that our customers need. And then finally, build out our cloud platform and compute storage in networking at the edge. And that\u2019s exactly what we have done and as we\u2019ve laid out that strategy, we looked at our portfolio, what do we need to add to the portfolio either in acquisitions or partnerships, what do we need to divest, because those assets are non-core to the strategy, it doesn\u2019t mean they are bad assets, they are just not -- they are not core to what we are doing. So if you take the ES transaction, listen, we are still going to be in the services business in fact 25% of the revenue of HPE will be services, it just a different kind of services business than IT outsourcing, business process outsourcing and apps maintenance. If you think about software, we are still going to be in the software business, it\u2019s just not in application software like ITOM, it is system software like OneView and the software that powers synergy. So it is a portfolio matching to the strategy that we see our competitive advantage in. As far as, I think you asked about further divestitures, so enterprise group as currently configured, needs to stay together and I\u2019ll tell why. My view of the market is everything is moving to converge and we have a differentiated position because we have networking storage and compute and that is not -- our two major competitors are missing a key component of that offering. So that we think is important to keep together. And then as you think technology services, technology services is the key differentiator for our company. We can help customers support, maintain advice and consult across the globe and it would be uneconomic to simply support storage only or networking only. So TS is absolutely integral. And then finally, obviously campus, branch and edge is a new growth area for the company, there is no reason that we should not own compute with the edge, there is no reason that we shouldn\u2019t own analytics with the edge in addition to obviously a Aruba. So I think to some degree the strategy has evolved, but really quite consistent with what we laid out and a big part of what we did this past year was portfolio optimization from this strategy. So on a go forward basis, I think as Tim said well, I think you can look for more ROI based smart acquisitions like Aruba, like SJI and so I think it's entirely consistent with the strategy that we laid out a year ago. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay thank you for that. Just as a follow up. Anytime you divest or acquire particularly -- in this case you say well, could I have done what others are going to do on my own. So what I mean by that is I can't help thinking that HPE software business is going to be like 75% of Micro Focus going forward, you are far, far, far bigger than they are from a revenue perspective. And they believe as a much smaller player that they can improve operating margins 2000 basis points, 2000 basis points on your revenue basis $750 million a year an operating process, which at a 10 multiple, 7.5 billion and you haven't given up the business. So I guess the question is if the margin improvement opportunities are so huge even for a relatively small player why did you either not extract a better price or why did you not believe that you could have extracted those and created even more value for shareholders? Meg Whitman : No, I think the first answer is this is what Micro Focus does. They are pure play Software Company who is expert at managing mature software assets. And as Micro Focus will tell you, most people who work in the software business and Silicon Valley want to grow assets. And actually some of these assets should actually be maintained on a stable platform that extends the value for customers and it\u2019s actually not what we do, it is what they do. But then you come to the question of, why did we do a spin-merge as oppose to sell the whole business? And the reason is, is because our shareholders will be able to ride the upside of what Micro Focus does. Remember our shareholders will own 50% of the new company and by the way, I will be a shareholder of that new company given my vested options and my vested RSUs in HPE. And I can tell you I will be holding those shares because I think they are going to do very, very well. And so this was a much better alternative than selling the company today on a PE multiple operating income because you get cash, but you pay taxes and then our shareholders wouldn't get to ride the upside unless they went out and took new money to buy those shares. So we thought that was absolutely the right thing to do. And I have to tell you Tony in today's world where technology is changing at lightning speed I've got to tell you the value of focus, I am seeing it every single day. And so while may be back in the day it was great to be a technology supermarket like the financial supermarkets of yesterday. What I am pretty sure of is the next four or five years is going to be all about speed, agility and focus and innovation in something that is a more narrow focus. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : I wanted to get a little more detail on the software spend. Will any of the software apps that stay with HPE business or will everything be spun-off? And then as part of that question, thinking about what you talked about at the Discover event the opportunities in Big Data, Internet of Things and Analytics. How does HPE benefit from those trends without having that software business? Thanks. Meg Whitman : Sure. So what lives in our software business unit today is in fact spun and merged with Micro Focus. But we still remain in the software business, it's just a different kind of software business as I said, system software. The software defined infrastructure is all powered by software, but it's not applications software if you will like ITOM or ADM it is actually system software that powers the infrastructure of our customers. Now, you say, all right so how do we capitalize on the Big Data and Analytics? Well, first of all, we will be the leader in high performance compute with the acquisition of SGI. So, companies need to process and compute huge amounts, ever escalating amounts of data. So really the high performance compute market which is an $11 billion business growing at 6% to 8% will really be between HPE now with SGI and Cray, but many of the other competitors like Dell, Lenovo they are not in that high performance compute business. So, as people need financial services, energy, as they need compute to process all this Big Data if you will, we will be the leading player there. If you think about campus, branch and edge I think this is the next big growth area. If you think about autonomous driving vehicles, jet engines, healthcare sensors in healthcare beds and in devices, this is an area where huge amounts of data needs to be processed real time at the edge as opposed to enduring the latency of coming back to a major datacenter. So we\u2019re going to be able to capitalize in the IoT trend by analytics at the edge and be able to compute and store at the edge. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019ll play in those trends, it will be different then like Vertica, which will go to Micro Focus, which is a big common or data base that processes huge amounts of data on a data base side, but we will pick-up the ability to process on compete storage and networking at the edge. Sherri Scribner : Okay, thank you. And then just a quick clarification for Tim. On the TS, the Technology Services side, looks like there is an 8 point difference between actual revenue and the adjusted revenue. Was there something other than currency in that number, because that seems like a big delta? Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : The H3C transaction impacted that as well. Sherri Scribner : Thanks. Meg Whitman : Because H3C had TS in China that went with that deal. Sherri Scribner : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : We\u2019ve come a long way for better together here. I give you a lot of credit, because you\u2019re basically creating this very focus companies whatever Computer Sciences is called and now Micro Focus, which I think does create a lot of shareholder value. But again when all is said and done, you\u2019re becoming more and more a hardware company and I would think your competitors ultimately are going to be primarily Cisco and Dell and obviously they\u2019ll use their large size against you and claim they\u2019ve got AI capabilities and so forth. How do you see matching up against them when all is said and done? And are you going to have a relationship with Micro Focus that\u2019s kind of favorite relation like you appear to have with Computer Sciences going forward? Meg Whitman : Yes. The answer of that is absolutely yes. And actually beyond that, you saw what we announced today with SUSE, where there will be our preferred partner for Linux, as well as the OpenStack Distro. And listen a lot of the software products that are going in the spin-merge will be important to us going forward. So there will be a relationship there. So let me just give you a sense, I think we\u2019re in a great position to compete with both Cisco and Dell. So for example, actually the HPE go forward strategy will be about $28 million Company, that\u2019s only slightly smaller than HP\u2019s than Dell\u2019s enterprise business and it is more focus with better innovations. I think we should just contrast our strategy with Dell. So we are getting smaller, well they\u2019re getting bigger. And this is important, because I believe speed and agility is critical in innovation and go-to-market. The second is they\u2019re levering up and we are delivering. We have $5.3 billion of net cash on the operating company and we\u2019re going to have a lot more by the time we\u2019re done with these transactions and that gives us dry powder, it also gives us the ability to return cash to shareholders. And I think it\u2019s difficult to be levered as much as Dell is in this environment. And then secondly, we\u2019re leaning into new technology either through our own innovation, acquisitions or partnerships and we\u2019ve got major focused on our side. What they\u2019re doing is doubling down in old technology and the cost take out play and listen I think, I might be quite successful for leadership team there, from a financial perspective, I\u2019m not so sure it\u2019s good for customers. Steve Milunovich : Okay. And then on enterprise group, just want to confirm that you said you do expect storage growth in the future now that\u2019s reported or adjusted or whatever. But also can you talk about servers and what went on in the quarter and do you expect that to return to growth? Meg Whitman : Sure. And by the way I forgot to address CISCO in your last question. So listen, CISCO is a good competitor, but they are missing a key element, which is storage. And as this converges, I think as in my environment converges and we look at hyper converged and on synergies, we\u2019re innovating really nicely now, for the traditional data center as well as the software defined data center and I got to tell you a Aruba at the edge is killing it. And a 20% growth rate above our internal plan and we're just winning deals hand over fist there so, we feel really good about our ability to compete with CISCO. Okay, back to servers, so listen what's happening in servers is there's sort of core server growth, then there is Tier 1 servers which is to the big service providers and then is obviously high performance compute and the reason we did the SGI acquisition is to really stake out a great position in an $11 billion business as I said before that's growing 6% to 8%, that's very profitable for the compute itself, but also there's very high TS attached to high performance compute. Core servers around the globe are under some pressure right now, but you saw what we did in terms of increasing the margin and we're doubling down on SMB which actually is still, there's pockets of growth in that area and we're also doing workload specialization -- okay we have the best compute in the world to run SAP HANAR, it's not even close with anyone else. So, we're specializing around workloads. And then obviously there was a tough compare because of Cloudline a year ago, I mean we've just ramped up business into a multi-billion dollar business and so it's hard to compete with those compares, but we expect to continue to gain share in that market profitably. We're not in it for share-for-share stake, we don't want to take unprofitable deal, but as we continue to work on supply chain and the rationalizations we become more competitive there. And we're very mindful that ultimately there's Chinese competitors there as well and whether they're Huawei or Lenovo, it's not just Dell. So we're very aware of the cost structure we have to have to continue to compete. Steve Milunovich : Any prediction of growth? Meg Whitman : I think sort of low single-digits is probably what we'll grow, it'll depend on how much Tier 1 service provider business we want to take. But I'd say what you saw 1% to 2% is probably good estimate going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Maynard Um : I was wondering if you can help me understand the $700 million after tax separation cost, when you say it will unlocking a more attractive financial profile. I guess what exactly does that mean, those redundant employee restructuring costs and will that drive up easy margins? And I've a follow-up. Tim Stonesifer : I think it's really a combination of couple of things, when you -- when we separate the software business and you look at the remaining piece of HPE, we're going to be -- if you were to extract ES and software from our 2016 financials, in Meg's earlier comments, revenue growth would be incremental 300 basis points, margins would be up in incremental 100 basis points just north of 10% and free cash flow as a percent of revenue would be up 50%. If you look at the absolute free cash flow, it would be relatively neutral driven by the fact that software does generate some free cash flow, but that's offset by the pressure in ES. So, when we're talking about the financial profile it's really related to RemainCo. Meg Whitman : And I have to say that with our Enterprise Group really being now the anchor for RemainCo, we've been very conscious about making sure that we've got an overhead cost structure that is in line with the $28 billion business, that we're making changes to how Enterprise Group is organized internally, there will be savings around our OpenStack Distro with our new relationship with SUSE and then finally moving HP Labs, Hewlett Packard Labs to EG is going to tighten the linkage between downstream development and commercialization which I think is something that needs to be done. So, we're all about making Enterprise Group more cost effective as we drive the RemanCo strategy. Tim Stonesifer : And I would also add on RemanCo keep in mind that recurring profit will be above 60%. Maynard Um : Great and then it looks like Dell raised pricing in the UK to offset the currency impact from Brexit, I was wondering if you could just talk about what impact that had on your business both in terms of revenue and margin and how we should think about that going forward? Will the hedging offset that to the bottom line? Thanks. Meg Whitman : Let me tell you what we saw from a demand perspective and Tim can talk a little bit about our broader hedging strategy. We were not able to hedge in the quarter for the pound degradation, but what we saw was actually a pause in purchasing in the UK. Certainly the UK public sector, but the also the UK and then more broadly Europe which was, this was unexpected, a big change, let's take a pause and decide what we want to do here. And when we saw in a very market way, what I will say in the last couple of weeks we're actually seeing orders pick up again. It was almost like they took a pause and basically had to take stock of what was happening and then basically the orders have started to flow again. I mean we continue to also monitor the pricing, competitive pricing environment that we see and we adjust as necessary particularly in the channel. So the channel is where we serve SMB and that's where our ability to sort of move the pricing in response to competition, we look at that actually every single week sometime multiple times a week. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : I want to talk more about TS, it was up this quarter for the first time in a while and on a sort of net of divestitures and constant currency basis. How do we think about it as you look at the placements you've made over the last year I think you've mentioned some benefit from some of the hardware that were in place, but just as you look at the mix of hyper scale and what have you that you put out there, do you expect this to continue to grow sort of net of everything, is there an opportunity given with some quarters that it may dip. Just how should we look at it because it's obviously very important from a margin perspective? Meg Whitman : So I think a little understood element of HPE is the dramatic transformation that TS has gone through. TS as is and was a very profitable business that was largely attached to business critical systems, very profitable very high attach. I mean you didn't really sell business critical systems without a TS attach. And when business critical systems both from a market perspective as well as the Oracle Itanium situation, by all right TS should be down 25%, if you remember Shannon over the last four or five years BCS was down 25% like clockwork every single quarter for four years as growing a little bit now. But all rights TS should have shrunk with BCS and it did not. And the reason it did not was very impressive new product offering, proactive care. Other areas where we help customers maintained their datacenters state and so the fact that in as actually only been down a few percentage points over the last 12 months is a testament to the leadership team in that business. And now what you're seeing is those new productive offering are starting to get real traction. Orders have been positive for the last three or four quarters and those orders are translated into growth this quarter, not a significant amount of growth, but 1%, we\u2019ll take it all day long because it is a very-very profitable business. So we have more work to do on Technology Services, I will tell you what is the benefit of now being a small and more focused company. Antonio Neri and I are going to spend a whole lot of time now on what is the next generation of Technology Services and whether that\u2019s flexible capacity services that allows consumption based model, whether it's proactive care, data center care, we are going to spend a lot of time there because it is the key strategic enabler of RemainCo HPE. Shannon Cross : Okay and then this is a follow up, I am curious for the core company that you are going to have less, the cost structure is relatively close to where it needs to be, or are there more opportunities whether -- I think you mentioned a little bit in terms of the corporate cost but then just also within EG, where you might be able to optimize overtime to perhaps offset some pressure in or mix pricing? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure I think from a cost structure perspective, we spent probably in the last 18 months, we have done some detailed benchmarking particularly in a functional areas as to where the business needs to be basically cost as a percent of revenue. So we are getting closer to those benchmarks, we are not quite there yet, but we are close and we are there in some of the functions. So as we have done these divestures or as we are doing these divestures, we obviously incorporate that into what the new cost structure needs to look like and obviously we need to be very aggressive around what we call stranded cost. So I think the good news is when you look at the HPE-HPI separation we did have some disynergies we call them, we have worked those through the system, with the H3C divesture, we\u2019ve got much better with identifying the stranded cost and being much more proactive in managing them out, we are starting to see those come out. So we are confident that we can continue to do that to get to the bench mark we need to get to when these transactions are done. Meg Whitman : I\u2019ll just add a couple more things. When you are going to take -- we\u2019ve been streamlining the cost structure of this company for four or five years, now we are starting to do things differently. Because you can only take out so much cost, there is only so much low hanging fruit, you have to do things differently and whether that is supply chain and logistics, whether that is how we are organized internally with all R&D under one R&D leader, whether it is putting our software defined infrastructure and our cloud offering under one leader, whether it is putting all of our go-to-market under one leader, where we have consistent go to market strategy discounting across the board. Frankly, we were much better at minimizing discounting in APJ and EMEA than we were in the United States. We now have that discipline across the company. And then finally corporate overhead we got have a corporate overhead that is designed for $28 million Company. And when we started we had a corporate overhead design for $110 billon company and then $50 billion Company and now at $28 billion Company. And I have to say I am really pleased with our ability to sort of right size the corporate overhead and be lean and mean, and that includes everything from HR, Finance, Legal IT things like real estates, systems. So we have made a lot of progress, but you will see more of that benefit I think in '17 and '18. Tim Stonesifer : Thank you, Shannon I think we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Our final question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : My question is regarding the separation cost, if I remember from the press release I think it was around 700 million, is that correct? And how should we think about that the timing of that and is that all in cost? And I kind of also take it relative to say the divestures of the services was just 900 million, and while 900 million is 200 million more than 700, it seems like to me that the services was a much bigger heavier lifting divestures. So I almost whether is 700 million kind of why just so much and not much lower, or is it just so much integrated in Hewlett Packard Enterprise, that\u2019s why it cost so much to break out? Thank you. Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So yes, $700 million is the right number. Again we feel like the value that that transaction is driving is phenomenal for HPE as well as its shareholders. However, to realize that value we need to make investments and allocate resources to do the separation. So to your point, software although the activities are similar in nature to the transaction in ES they are discreet and they are not necessarily driven by revenue base or headcount levels. So when you look at software it's a global complex business, it has multiple legal entities that have been accumulated overtime through a series of transactions and because of that when you look at the tax to finance the legal the operating structure it is still very, very complicated. So, in order to separate that there are some large expense items in there, for example, separating 650 IT systems during the carve out financials translating GAAP to IFRS splitting a 150 legal entities in 60 countries, trying to figure out what we want to do with 200 real estate sites across the globe. So, there is certainly a lot of work that needs to be done there. The good news is we have done this before, so we know how to do it. The team has been very proactive and we are all over it, we have the work screens identified. So, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll get there when we go for it. Meg Whitman : The other thing, I think that's important Jim is, we have come these separations that we have done today whether it was HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, whether its ES from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We have come in on time and actually below budget. And so we're really proud of that. And we expect that to happen, I don't know how much, listen 700 is what you should have in your models. If we're on target we ought to come in a little lighter than that. Tim Stonesifer : And the other way I think about it is the benefit of the deal far outweighs the cost, right. So when we get that $2.5 billion cash dividend and that will be on shore cash that far outweighs the cost of doing the transaction. Jim Suva : Thank you for the details and congratulations to you and your team. Meg Whitman : Thank you very much. Tim Stonesifer : Appreciate it. Thank you, everyone for joining today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our call for today. Thank you. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Angie, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andrew Simanek : Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates presented beginning with fiscal year 2015, are adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps to provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance, given the significant divestitures we\u2019ve recently completed, including the sale of Mphasis 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details. With that, let me turn it over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Thanks, Andy, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. FY 2016 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a standalone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to introduce groundbreaking innovation, and began to transform the company through strategic changes designed to enable even better focus, flexibility and financial performance. Our success in FY 2016 is proof that we\u2019re on the right course. HPE today has the ability to better respond to the constantly evolving marketplace, while generating long-term value for shareholders. The leadership team can dive more deeply into products, have more time to spend with customers and partners, and can constantly develop our strategy. From an innovation perspective, we can be much more targeted in the investments we make. The results of all this focus are reflected in our performance. For the year, we delivered revenue of $50.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures and currency, and in line with the outlook we provided at our Analyst Meeting in 2015. While there is always more work to do, our go-to-market motion is strong and our increase confidence is really paying off. We saw growth this year in key areas of the portfolio, including high performance compute, Cloudline servers, all-flash storage, converged systems, mission critical systems, and networking with Aruba. Technology Services returned to growth in the last two quarters of the year and we expect that momentum to continue into FY 2017. Strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew over 30%, driven by Helion Managed Cloud, which grew over 50% and Virtual Private Cloud, which grew over 100%. And in software, we saw solid SaaS and security growth, with particular strength in Vertica and voltage solutions. In terms of profitability, we grew our non-GAAP operating profit as a percentage of revenue, due in large part to the tremendous progress the Enterprise Services team has made. ES ended the year with a non-GAAP operating profit of 7.7% above our outlook range of 6% to 7% and in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%. In the Enterprise Group, we continue to hone the balance between revenue growth and profitability. During the past two quarters, we\u2019ve seen steady margin improvement and feel confident that the ongoing cost actions we\u2019re taking and the greater mix of converged and software defined solutions, as well as networking and storage will offset the pressure in core servers going forward. And in software, the team maintained a disciplined focus on cost controls, driving margin improvement in the year. Overall, we delivered FY 2016 non-GAAP EPS of $1.92 at the high-end of our original outlook for the year. Turning to cash flow. We delivered free cash flow of $2.1 billion above our most recent guided range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This is particularly strong, given that we were able to offset the lower cash flow, resulting from the divestiture of 51% of our H3C business through careful working capital management. Given the strong cash flow and the proceeds from recent divestitures, we were able to return over $3 billion of cash to shareholders throughout the year, and still end the year with an operating company net cash position of $7.6 billion, the highest since I\u2019ve been with the company. In FY 2016, we also announced strategic changes to the company that will help strengthen our performance over the long-term. We completed the divestiture of our stake in Mphasis and our sale of 51% of our H3C business in China. In May, we announced a spin-merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. And in September, we announced the spin-merger of our software business with Micro Focus. Together, these transactions are valued at over $20 billion. They will enable us to be more nimble, provide cutting edge solutions, play in higher growth markets, and have an enhanced financial profile. The success of the separation of HPE and HP Inc. and the progress we made as an independent company have been recognized by investors. HPE\u2019s stock is up more than 50% since we launched the company on November 2, 2015. Looking forward, the HPE that emerges after the two spin mergers will have a clear vision, the right assets, and direct line of sight to significant market opportunities. Our goal is to be the industry\u2019s leading provider of hybrid IT built on the secured next generation software defined infrastructure that runs our customer\u2019s data centers today, bridges them to multi cloud environments tomorrow, and powers the emerging intelligent edge that will run campus, branch and industrial IoT applications for decades to come, all delivered through a world-class services capability. Let me spend a minute on each element of our vision. First, we believe the world is going to be hybrid and our mission is to make hybrid IT simple. To do this, we offer market leading technology across a traditional data center, software defined infrastructure, and private cloud. We\u2019re focused on winning in key growth areas in the traditional data center like big data analytics, high performance compute, all-flash storage and networking. To that end, this year we announced game changing new products with new versions of our Gen9 Servers and 3PAR StoreServ systems. We also acquired SGI, cementing our leadership position in high performance computing and strengthening our capability in data analytics. In fact, it was just announced that we now have 140 high performance computing systems on the top 500 supercomputing list, more than anyone else in the industry. In software defined infrastructure, we launched new categories with offerings like synergy, the industry\u2019s first composable infrastructure and our Hyper Converged 380 solution, which was just named the number one data center infrastructure product in CRN\u2019s Annual Tech Innovator Awards, beating out solutions from Dell, EMC, and Cisco, and we are establishing an ecosystem of partners to bring together and integrate the industry\u2019s best technologies from companies like Arista, Mesosphere, Docker, Shaft and Microsoft Azure to allow customers to seamlessly manage across an increasingly complex set of environment. Second, we will power the emerging intelligent edge. As data volumes increase in business environments outside of the data center, like factories and retail stores, customers need a new set of tools to gather, process, and analyze the critical information that will allow them to make decisions in real time. This means that they need compute storage and connectivity at the edge, integrated into their operational environments, and seamlessly connected to their hybrid IT environments. Through our Aruba offerings in security, analytics and connectivity, and our edge line converged IoT systems, we\u2019re building an ecosystem of partners and bringing unique solutions to this fast-growing market. I like to say, we are going to be the IT in IoT. Third, services is going to be more critical than ever. As customers look to deploy both hybrid IT and the intelligent edge programs, they need a partner who can help them manage through change and complexity. Our Technology Services organization delivers world-class advisory, support, and consumption models, as well as building customer solutions from the ground up. In addition to our TS Group that provides these advisory transformation and support capabilities, our financial services organization brings the financial flexibility and consumption models that our customers are increasingly looking for. With this portfolio, we estimate we have a total addressable market of over $250 billion, that\u2019s growing at 2% to 3% a year. And within that, there are areas of very high growth like high performance compute, private cloud, software defined networking, and industrial IoT. We are already well-positioned to lead in these areas and you will see us continue to invest in a targeted way. What is most exciting is that, our approach is resonating with our customers, partners, and the industry. In the fourth quarter, we continue to win customers looking for hybrid IT and intelligent edge solutions and services. For example, in hybrid IT, we recently replaced a 19-year EMC relationship with a major global healthcare company, where we will provide services and technology to deliver simplicity, operating efficiencies, and automation as the company modernizes and realigns their core storage and compute platforms. In the intelligent edge market, Nordstrom recently named Aruba as their preferred provider for their Wi-Fi services strategy in all their stores, distribution centers, and corporate sites. And we announced a significant new wireless network roll out at Penske Truck Leasing to enable greater workforce productivity and connectivity at its truck facilities. Finally, our Technology Services business continues to deliver significant value to customers and win deals. For example, in Q4, TS won a major five-year deal with its flexible capacity service for a large European auto manufacturer. It also won a five-year agreement with a large global bank based in Europe, which chose our data center care service to operate its data centers around the world. Looking ahead, next week, we kick off Discover London, where we will bring together nearly 10,000 customers and partners to demo our latest products and services. During the week, you will see exciting product announcements across hybrid IT and the intelligent edge, and hear from some of our customers about how we are helping them achieve their business outcomes. So overall, I\u2019m very pleased with the progress we made in FY 2016. We delivered the financial performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to groundbreaking innovation, and began to transform the company in ways we believe will deliver an exciting future for customers, partners, employees, and investors. I\u2019m excited about the path we see ahead and very much look forward to the journey. And now, I will hand the call over to Tim, who will provide details on the quarter. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks, Meg, and good afternoon, everyone. I agree that fiscal year 2016 was a strong first year across a number of fronts. We successfully delivered the financial outlook we laid out at the beginning of the year, while making several strategic portfolio changes. Now, I\u2019ll spend sometime providing more detail on our fourth quarter results. Overall, I\u2019d say that we performed well in a tough market and continue to make progress improving our cost structure and strengthening our go-to-market approach. Fourth quarter revenue of $12.5 billion was down approximately 2% when adjusted for divestitures and currency, as we continue to focus on profitable market share and executed well in an uneven global demand environment. From a macro perspective, we saw continued revenue softness in Europe, particularly in ES, due to a persistent slowing in the UK public sector business. On an as reported basis, performance in the Americas was encouraging with low single-digit growth in the Enterprise Group and Services. APJ performance was mixed with improved EG and ES results in both China and Japan, but weakness in the rest of Asia. Currency fluctuations were a headwind to revenue by 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by depreciation in the British pound and somewhat offset by appreciation in the Japanese yen. Turning to profitability. Gross margin of 30.4%, was up 80 basis points year-over-year due to continued improvements to deal profitability and Enterprise Services. Sequentially, gross margin was up a 110 basis points, principally due to normal seasonal uplift in both ES and software. We continue to drive cost productivity and reduce non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year with significant improvements in ES delivery costs. Also, EG. continue to execute on the cost plan we discussed at SAM, in order to further align costs with revenue. Given those actions, non-GAAP operating profit of 11.1% was up a 150 basis points year-over-year and 230 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.61 was in line with our outlook of $0.58 to $0.63. For the full-year, non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $1.92 and the center of our outlook of $1.90 to $1.95. Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes tax obligation settlements of $647 million and pre-tax amount for restructuring charges of $395 million, separation charges of $293 million, and amortization of intangible assets of $126 million, offset by tax indemnification adjustments of $311 million and the gain from the Mphasis divestiture of $253 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18 below our previously provided outlook range of $0.44 to $0.49, primarily due to the previously mentioned settlements of outstanding Hewlett-Packard Company tax obligations that we shared with HP Inc. through our separation agreement. Now, turning to results by business. In the Enterprise Group, we continue to work on improving operating margins by focusing on profitable deals, reducing discretionary spend, and delayering as we right size the organization ahead of the separation from ES and software. Operating margins were down slightly year-over-year, were up 60 basis points sequentially to 13.2%. Revenue declined 3% in Q4. However, we had several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio. Aruba was up 13%, all-flash arrays were up more than a 100%, high-performance compute was up more than 30%, and we had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in mission critical systems. And our highest margin business technology services grew for the second consecutive quarter. These results are reflection of the continued investments we\u2019ve made in our higher growth businesses like our software defined, converged, and hyper converged offerings, as well as our go-to-market efforts. Server revenue declined 6% as growth in high-performance and mission critical compute was offset by pressure in the core servers and service provider vertical. In the core we saw some incremental competitive pressure, particularly in Blade. However, our recently launched synergy line will allow us to better compete in the Blade segment and we anticipate taking back share as this product line ramps. As we previously discussed, we are prioritizing profit over market share, and as a result, saw some sales contraction in Tier 1. While this has put some pressure on revenue, we see opportunities to grow in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 space, which are growing faster and have better economics, including greater TS attach. Encouragingly the growth in high-performance compute and mission-critical systems was independent of our acquisition of SGI, which we completed just after the end of the quarter and should help drive further profitable growth. Storage revenue declined 3% with continued contraction in the legacy portfolio. However, the higher-margin converged storage portfolio was up 1% and it\u2019s now 56% of the total storage mix. Traditional storage declined by 11% particularly challenged by weakness in entry storage. However, our recently introduced MSA entry offerings should drive improvement going forward. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 2%, while all-flash 3PAR revenue grew nearly 100% and now makes up approximately 50% of total 3PAR revenue revenue. Keep in mind all-flash only makes up 10% of datacenter storage today. So we see a significant growth opportunity going forward. We also anticipate some uplift from our recently announced compression offerings, which fill a gap in our portfolio. Networking revenue was flat, but encouragingly, Aruba continue to take share and grew 13%. We should see this growth in Aruba accelerate next quarter, as we had some installations in the quarter pushed out into Q1. Also, we did see a slowdown on e-rate government infrastructure spending for education, which impacted both wireless and switching in campus. And keep in mind that we just launched our new Arista partnership, which enables us to offer highly differentiated data center networking solutions, which we expect will grow in future quarters. Technology Services grew for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue up 2%. Orders are also returned to growth in quarter and grew for the full-year. We saw encouraging performance and non-attach and proactive services and continue to improve service intensity, or attach dollars per unit, both of which are helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and lower server units. Enterprise Services revenue declined 2%, as growth in the Americas in APJ was more than offset by softness in EMEA. For the full-year, revenue declined 1.1% in line with the outlook we provided at the 2015 Analyst Day. Operating profit improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 10.7%, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009, as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements and delivery and sales. For the full-year, we delivered operating margins of 7.7%, well above original guidance of 6% to 7%. We continue to track against our longer-term goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 51% of our headcount in low-cost locations. This is an 8 point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. It\u2019s also worth highlighting that our customer satisfaction has increased from these cost structure improvements and it\u2019s spin-merge announcement. Software revenue was flat, as strength and security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. We have stabilized license revenue, which was only down 1%, as compared to down 18% in Q3. Also encouragingly, the renewal rate for high-margin support contracts improved 3 points year-over-year to over 90%. SaaS had another record quarter with a 11% revenue growth. The team also continue to focus on disciplined cost controls, and as a result, the operating margin improved 220 basis points to 32.1%. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year, as reported revenue growth. Operating profit declined 70 basis points year-over-year to 10.2% from higher operating expenses and lower residual maturities. Financing volume declined 3% in constant currency from a tough compare. Return on equity was down 200 basis points year-over-year to 14.1% and was pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2014. Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to improve working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, and free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 84% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. For the full-year, we generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion above our most recent outlook of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. And despite the H3C divestiture delivered cash flow in line with our original guidance for the year. The cash conversion cycle was six days, down 12 days sequentially. Payables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement, as we continue to make progress with vendor terms. Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we paid $92 million as part of our normal dividend. We also continue to reduce share count in the fourth quarter through our accelerated share repurchase program, which required all cash be paid when the program started in Q3. For the full-year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. This is approximately three times our original commitment at the start of the year. Lastly, as part of our continued efforts to return capital to shareholders, we increased our dividend payment by 18% to $0.065 per share effective for the January 4, 2017 payment. Now moving to the announcement spin merge transactions, both ES, CSC and software Micro Focus transactions are on schedule and on budget. We filed the initial Form 10 and S4 for the ES/CSC spin-merge earlier this month. We anticipate filing the final registration statements in late February and we\u2019re on track to complete the transaction by April 1. The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned and we continue to anticipate in transaction closing on approximately August 31. We recently gave detailed fiscal year 2017 guidance at a Securities Analyst Day and I encourage you to review our financial overview presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. However, I think it\u2019s worth reiterating a few points. We continue to expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2 to $2.10 for the combined HPE, as it stands today. $1.25 to $1.35 for the future HPE and reported EPS of $1.45 to $1.55. Normalized free cash flow for the combined HPE should be $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, while future HPE would generate $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in fiscal year 2017. And we expect reported free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion, as cash will be significantly impacted by restructuring and separation payments, the ES pension funding, and the mid-year impact of the spin-merge transactions on cash generation. As we discussed at SAM, please keep in mind that Q1 will use a significant amount of cash and cash flow will be even more back-end loaded in fiscal year 2017, as compared to normal seasonality. The key drivers include the fact that our first quarter is typically the weakest cash generating quarter, due to the seasonality of ES and software earnings. We also make our annual bonus payment in Q1, and we expect to fund the majority of the ES pension payment in the first quarter. And finally, we expect Q1 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.46, and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.03 to $0.07. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thanks. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of detail on your thoughts about the change in the administration in the U.S. I know it\u2019s early days and we don\u2019t have a lot of details. But can you maybe give us your thoughts on repatriation, if there\u2019s a repatriation holiday? And will you see any benefit if there\u2019s a tax cut for U.S. corporations? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. So it\u2019s obviously early days. But if they were to make some tax changes, I\u2019d break it down into a couple of buckets. The first one would be the U.S. statutory rate. So to your point, if they were to reduce that, we would definitely benefit from that and probably provide us a little bit more flexibility maybe the level the playing field a little bit with non-U.S. multinationals. The second bucket is around the repatriation tax. So if they were to reduce that or provide some sort of tax holiday that would be benefit to us. As you know, a majority of our cash is offshore. So that would again give us some more flexibility to bring that cash onshore and make investments in the U.S. Sherri Scribner : And if they were to \u2013 if you were to bring that cash back, would you use it for a dividend, or to raise the buyback or the dividends? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, we would continue to implement our disciplined ROI-based approach towards capital allocation. I mean, obviously, right now, we were aggressive in 2016 with our share repurchases. To Meg\u2019s point earlier, we returned $3 billion, which was three times our original commit. For 2017, obviously, we\u2019re biased toward share repurchases and 2017 we commit another $3 billion. So I think, we\u2019ll continue to work the disciplined ROI-based approach is working well for us so far and we\u2019ll continue to operate within that framework in 2017. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha. Please go ahead, from Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : Hi. Thank you for the question. One for Meg, and just on the visibility, it looks like the company returns to declining revenues after a few good quarters of growth that we saw this year. Could you speak about how visibility has changed going through 2016, whether there has been any major change? And then just one thing that\u2019s linked to that. There was a period of time when your storage business was gaining share. And on top of that your networking business is benefiting not only with Aruba, but also because Aruba was driving revenue synergy was switching, has that now fully played out, or should that growth there return at some point? Thanks. Meg Whitman : Yes. Let me talk about the decline in the growth rates in the last two quarters and particularly Q4. But I would say when you look at the full-year, the company grew 2% and Enterprise Group, obviously, which is going to be the anchor of the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, grew 3% for the year. But I think, as FY 2016 demonstrated that there are challenges balancing revenue and margins in EG, and now we are going to be focused on growing overall operating profit dollars. So as you know, in the first-half, we delivered great growth. And in the second-half, while we delivered great growth, but the margins were lower than we would have liked. In the second-half, we pivoted back more towards margins focusing on the profitable deals and improving our cost structure that resulted in a quarter-over-quarter margin improvement of 90 basis points in Q3, another 60 basis points in Q4, but revenue slowed to flat in Q3 and was down 3% in Q4. So we really have \u2013 we\u2019ve spent some time titrating, if you will, the balance between revenue growth and profitability. And so now, as I look at 2017, I think we can grow revenue and operating margins at the same time going forward. And let me tell you why I think that? First is, we need to shore up core ISS rack with improvements in the channel, improvements in quote to cash, and focus \u2013 more focused on the distributors and VARs for the volume-related ISS rack business. Second, we\u2019ve got to continue to invest in the higher growth businesses, which are doing pretty well, high-performance compute with SGI, 3PAR all flash, Aruba, Synergy, the HC 380. And those offerings are actually growing nicely and are accretive to the overall enterprise group margins. Third, and this is one of those unintended great consequences of the separation of ES from the Hewlett Packard remaining company, is that alliances with former ES competitors like Accenture, PwC, the Indian outsourcers, they no longer view us as a competitor, and we are being integrated into a lot of their offerings that we were never integrated in before, and it\u2019s been fascinating to me how much more traction, I think, we\u2019re going to get with those alliance partners. And then fourth, we\u2019re enhancing our go-to-market with a new focus on Tier 2 and Tier 3 that offer better growth at a higher margin. And then finally, as you noted in the quarter, TS has returned to growth. And this is important because of the margins in TS. Everyone knows how margin rich TS is. So even a slight return to growth in TS actually helps mitigate margin pressure in ISS rack. And then lastly, we\u2019re continuing to optimize our cost structure. A flatter and leaner organization with lower G&A spend, tighter alignment of R&D spend to the market opportunities, and then a further improvement in our go-to-market model. So listen, we sort of titrated a bit during the year. The first-half was faster growth, lower margin; second-half of the year was lower growth, higher margin; and now we\u2019ve got to drive down the middle of the highway for next year. And as I outlined, I think there\u2019s real good reasons to think that\u2019s going to be the case. With regard to networking, Aruba actually is doing really well. It was a little slower growth this quarter, because a big implementation moved into Q4. It is still driving campus switching and then, of course, now we are a reseller of Aruba, I mean, of Arista. And that \u2013 so those revenues will fall in our P&L and the margin that we make selling Arista will actually be margin accretive to the overall EG Group. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m optimistic about revenue growth and operating margin in EG in 2017. Kulbinder Garcha : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Kulbinder. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : Next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I have one for Meg and I guess, one for Tim. Meg, I appreciate your response on the last question. I suppose the Senate could say your comps were pretty easy in the first-half of 2016, and so you were able to grow EG, and your comps became more difficult in the second-half, and you weren\u2019t able to grow, and the bad news is the comps are even tougher for the next couple of quarters for EG. And I can\u2019t help noting that your characterization of the server market is much more cautious than it was a couple of quarters ago. I think you characterized it as seeing ongoing pressure in core servers. And talking about hyper converged being lower margins and lower support attach. So it feels as though, perhaps the market is getting tougher when you adjust for comps. I\u2019m not sure the performance was \u2013 and for TS, I\u2019m not really sure, the performance was much better in the second-half. So, I was wondering if you could characterize what you think the status of the server market is going forward? And what you think is a realistic market growth rate on a go-forward basis? And whether my characteristic of your having a different opinion that now versus six months ago is fair? Meg Whitman : Yes. So listen, I actually think your comp point is actually correct, because remember Q1 and Q2, we were not yet anniversarying Cloudline and Cloudline was a big grower for us. We also, Aruba was there as well. I would say, when you look at the market, I \u2013 and we did say by the way, we thought it was going to get tougher in the second-half. The main pressure we\u2019re seeing is an ISS rack. A little bit in Blade, but frankly, we\u2019re going to recover in Blades, because of synergy. But ISS rack is where the most ongoing pressure is. Hyper converged is actually growing and is higher margin than our core ISS product as is synergy, as is high-performance compute, as is mission critical systems, and of course, as is TS. So the main area that we\u2019ve got to work on is shoring up that ISS rack, and that\u2019s all volume-based and it\u2019s all through the channel. So DiSTI\u2019s, VARs, that things like our newly redone value-added reseller program and our ability to do quote the cash fast and our ability to fulfill faster than our competitors. So I would say that if we can shore up ISS rack then I\u2019m confident in the growth rates of these other businesses that we\u2019re now gaining real traction in. So there\u2019s weakness in ISS rack. I think, we are not executing as well as we could and we aim to fix that. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. If I could follow-up\u2026 Meg Whitman : Sure. Toni Sacconaghi : Meg, a question for Tim. But Meg, you didn\u2019t give me your sense of what you think the market growth in servers going forward. But Tim just quickly on cash conversion cycle, I think, you\u2019ve talked about a sustainable level being in the mid-teens, you were down at six days this quarter, is that sustainable and if it\u2019s not then isn\u2019t that a cash headwind for next year? And are your cash flow assumptions still doable, i.e., did you kind of pull forward on cash conversion have better cash flow this year at the expense of next year? Do you really think, we can take six days to the bank for next year? And Meg, if you could follow-up on that run rate? Meg Whitman : Yes, okay. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. So on the CCC to your point, we did come in a little bit hot in Q4. It was primarily driven through working capital improvements. And to your point about sustainability, we do think it\u2019s sustainable, because when you look at the improvements we\u2019ve made in 2016, in general, it\u2019s really around three areas. So if you look at AP, for example, we went out in 2016 and we hit up all of our suppliers and extended our payment terms. So those terms should hold through 2017, and they just came in fourth quarter a little bit better, the improvement came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. If you look at AR, we really spent a lot of time this year, improving our processes, improving our line of sight around past dues, as an example. So we cut our past dues from call it 10%, down to 5%. And again, those are sustainable as you think about going into 2017, assuming we execute. And then even in inventory, inventory levels were lower than we had anticipated in Q4. Again, similar to AR, we put in some higher report \u2013 reporting, improved accountability, particularly around buffer stocking in our key commodity. So you we have plans in place, and more important, I think, we have better visibility and accountability to execute. So we would anticipate those to hold in 2017. The only thing I would say about 2017 is, we don\u2019t guide cash flow on a quarterly basis. But just keep in mind, if you are looking at CCC, there tends to be a seasonal uplift from Q4 to Q1 and that\u2019s primarily driven by purchasing linearity. But overall, we feel comfortable with our guidance, 2017. Meg Whitman : On market growth, Toni, we\u2019ve got sort of dialed in about 1% to 2% growth rate in servers. And remember that includes things like high-performance compute, which is an $11 billion to $12 billion market growing 6% to 8%, mission critical systems actually now growing again for us, hyper converged and converged growing as a market with the core ISS declining. So but overall to answer your question directly 1% to 2%. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kathryn Huberty : Yes, thank you. At the beginning of the call, you talked about networking and storage offsetting weakness in core servers. But when you look at the storage business, it declined 3,% converged up only 1%. So what is your outlook for storage? How quickly can it return to growth? And are you happy with the storage portfolio or their gaps that could help, if you fill those gaps helped return to growth sustainably in that segment? Then I have a quick follow-up? Meg Whitman : Sure. Well, let me take the first part of that and then Tim you can lay in. So, listen, storage, as we said, it continues to be challenged by declines in traditional storage. But we\u2019re seeing very solid growth in pre-PAR, overall it was up 5% and all-flash was up 100% year-over-year and it\u2019s now $750 million annualized run rate and that excludes services. And all-flash now makes up 50% of our pre-PAR portfolio and interestingly still only comprises 10% of the data center. So we see more running room in our all-flash business. And the introduction we\u2019re introducing new deduplication technology that should provide some further uplift in all-flash array, because there has been a gap in our portfolio. Traditional storage this quarter declined 11% and that was particularly challenged in entry storage. And I think, we introduced a new MSA offering to address the entry market that I think should benefit us going forward. So I think, you\u2019ll see storage continued to be a strong point for us, where we\u2019ve got that old, you\u2019ve got traditional storage declining and the new stuff growing, but feeling pretty good about the 2017 outlook, given the strength of the portfolio and the momentum we have in all-flash. Kathryn Huberty : Meg, is there opportunity to add to the portfolio and get the converged mix even higher, so that it can offset the weakness in traditional longer-term? Meg Whitman : Yes, listen, if you think about our growth strategy, honestly, it\u2019s got four different pieces to it. And we talked about this at the Security Analyst Meeting. But obviously, it\u2019s organic investment. Look at our 380 \u2013 HP 380, our Edge line product 3PAR all-flash, our synergy offering. The second is partnership. And actually, we\u2019re very excited about our Microsoft Azure partnership is getting real traction, as well as our Arista partnership which is new, but actually often running, we\u2019ve got very nice pipeline building there. And then the ones that are obviously Shaft, Docker, Mesosphere things like that. And then M&A, so it\u2019s \u2013 I mean, Tim said it well as the return base M&A strategy. And the M&A that\u2019s worked for us is 3Com, 3PAR, Aruba, SGI, what do they have in common? Reasonable and understandable valuations, enhancing the current portfolio, leveraging our distribution capabilities, and driving profitable growth. But we are very focused on a returns-based look at this. And as Tim said, we still think that the stock price has embedded in Hewlett Packard Enterprise today around remain go, if you can sort of pull out what you think as software is worth, what you think ES is worth. We still think there\u2019s tremendous value in the remaining company that\u2019s still embedded in overall HPE. So stock repurchase, and as I said, stock repurchase share buyback is \u2013 that\u2019s where we lean towards. Kathryn Huberty : And finally, did you see any impact of the U.S. election? You talked a couple of times about installations being pushed out in the quarter, obviously, there were some areas of weakness maybe HP execution-related. But curious if you think there was any delay in spending ahead of election that would then come back in the January quarter? Meg Whitman : We did not see that, not at all in the U.S. Actually, we saw a bigger impact of Brexit when the UK decided to leave European Union, because it actually froze purchasing quite broadly across Europe for a bit. We didn\u2019t see that in the U.S. Kathryn Huberty : Thank you. Tim Stonesifer : Great. Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : Next question comes from Steve Milunovich from UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Milunovich : Thank you. Back on servers, Antonio, at the Analyst Day talked about ASPs going up and don\u2019t necessarily follow microprocessors, because there\u2019s more storage and so forth. Is that occurring and do you expect that to continue to occur? And kind of the flipside of that is, you talked about backing off maybe some of the Tier 1 hyper scalars. I know Cloudline has been fairly material to you particular the first-half of last year. Are you anticipating Cloudline is going to be significantly less than it\u2019s been and do you still believe you didn\u2019t get revenue growth? Meg Whitman : Yes. So ASPs are going up, as exactly as Antonio suggested that at the Security Analyst Meeting and we expect that to continue. So Cloudline, listen, Cloudline is a pretty big business for us. And when done correctly, we actually make money on Cloudline. But we just have to be sure every deal has to be looked at on a one-off basis, which is what\u2019s the forward pricing going to look like? Can we imagine making money at a forward pricing? And I basically said to the team, listen, we do not want to be doing negative deals here for the most part. What\u2019s the point in telling things at loss? And so we really want to make sure that we make money on these deals and profitable deals in Cloudline is more important than market share. That said, Cloudline particularly relevant not only in Tier 1, but Tier 2 and Tier 3. The profit margins are better in Tier 2 and Tier 3. So I think Cloudline has a bright future in 2017, especially as we do a better job of penetrating Tier 2 and Tier 3, which is the sales forces all focused on. But frankly, there\u2019s not a big sales force component to those deals. The sales force gets the leads and then it\u2019s turned over to an engineering sale, so it has lower FSC associated with it. But Cloudline has been absolutely the right thing for us to do. We just need to continue to leverage into profit \u2013 profitable deals. Steven Milunovich : If I can sneak one in on industrial Internet of Things. I thought it was interesting at the Analyst Day that the edge became kind of a third pillar. And I understand that you defined that as anything out of the data center, so Aruba is most of that today. Meg Whitman : Yes. Steven Milunovich : But what about the more true Internet of Things you talked about maybe some edge servers. Most of us have heard this for five-plus years. Are we closer to something happening and what particular role does HP play? Meg Whitman : Yes. Well, I don\u2019t, you probably haven\u2019t heard it from us in the past five years, because really, I think, we\u2019ve begun to understand the opportunity for compute and storage at the edge with intelligence built in in the last year-and-a-half since we owned Aruba. And our first product there, the edge line converged systems, we\u2019re pretty excited about that, and you can start to see some real momentum in the field. But it\u2019s early days for us. It\u2019s early days for us. And the way I would think about it is, IoT is largely very industry vertical focus, which is why we\u2019ve focused on industrial IoT with probably four verticals that we want to go after. And then become known for being the IT in IoT, so that you can compute and store at the edge with Vertica built in. So that\u2019s the strategy. It\u2019s early days. I think it is another growth leg for the company. But remember, this is early days. We were excited about it, but we\u2019ve got some work to do to prove it out over the next year to 18 months. Steven Milunovich : Thanks. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : Next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to talk about what you\u2019ve been doing in response to the shifts in foreign exchange rates? In particular, I have the impression you\u2019ve had to raise some prices in Europe, just want to understand whether that\u2019s some of the issue you experienced with a little bit softness in Europe? And then in terms of the outlook, if there is inflation in the United States and what your assumptions are for foreign exchange rates, as we go into 2017? Thank you. Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. So, as far as Q4, we did see a little bit of that pressure, but not significant. But to your point, as you look, I mean, the currency environment has definitely been volatile in the last few weeks. And to your point, when you look at sort of where the rates are to-date versus where we guided, call it, mid-October, some of the rates are unfavorable. For example, if you look at the euro, the euro was at 110, and now it\u2019s probably at 106, 107 something like that. So, given our global footprint that does put some pressure on the operations now. Having said that, it\u2019s very early in the year and we do have some hedging programs in place. So we didn\u2019t feel it was prudent at this stage to adjust our guide. And then in addition to that, the teams are being very proactive and very aggressive around the cost structure. There are also to your point in EMEA, we\u2019re looking at opportunities to improve pricing to offset some of that pressure. So, I would just say this to wrap it up is, we\u2019re keeping a close eye on the currencies. And at the same time we\u2019re also implementing operational actions to help mitigate any pressure. Meg Whitman : One of the things, I think, that we sort of figured out probably three or four years ago is, we were probably in a strengthening dollar environment for the foreseeable future. And that was after 10 years, where currency was the wind that most businesses back. And three or four years ago that changed and it changed hard. So we have completely internalized that we have to have a cost structure that allows us to win in a challenging foreign exchange environment. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken the cost out of the company that we have. That is why we\u2019re making sure that there are virtually no stranded costs left at Hewlett Packard Enterprise after software goes and ES goes. I mean, we basically by the end of this fiscal year, we\u2019ll have no stranded costs at all relative to these two big divestitures, which for a company our size and scale is a pretty big achievement, because one of the things, I think, we\u2019ve come to realize is the overhead structure that was required to knit together the old HP. And then Hewlett Packard Enterprise is with a pretty high overhead structure, because the diversity of the businesses we ought to be able to run much leaner and meaner and we anticipate exiting the year at a much lower overhead as a percentage of revenue than we have in the past. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. Andrew Simanek : Thank you, Simon. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Maynard Um : Hi, thanks. You talked more about focusing more on profits versus revenues in the back-half. But as I look at your EG margins, it\u2019s lower than I think would be normal sequential growth. So can you just walk us through the factors there and whether this should be the base to use for op margins going forward pretty much from here bottoming Q1 and then rising going forward? And then I have a follow up. Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. I mean, if you look at sequentially, I mean, EG margins were up about 90 basis points in Q3 and then in Q4 up another 60 basis points. So we are seeing some improvement. If you look at total year, or if you look at year-over-year, there\u2019s a negative 40 basis points. So one thing that you do need to keep in mind is the H3C divestiture. So that was profit. That was flowing through our profit in last year and this year, it\u2019s flowing through OY need. So I think that could be part of the discrepancy as well. Maynard Um : Got it. And then can you help us understand your thought process around the timing of share repurchases this fiscal year. Do you think you\u2019ll wait until the spins to get more aggressive in the buybacks, or because if you wait until the spin-off of ES, for example, you\u2019d be able to buy back shares presumably in the teens versus where your stock is now in the low 20s. So I\u2019m just curious if you can give us a sense about how you think about timing on share repurchases? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, the stock price will go down, or will be adjusted, if you will, once we do the divestitures. But we try to take a balanced approach. So we will be buying stock back throughout the course of the year. So we just want to make sure we keep a balanced perspective on the share buybacks. Maynard Um : Great. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : All right. Thank you, Maynard. Next question please. Operator : The next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you. I was curious, Meg, can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re seeing on the competitive landscape? Obviously Dell/EMC is closed, Lenovo just announced a deal with nimble. I\u2019m just kind of curious as to what you\u2019re seeing from your competitors? And I have a follow-up. Meg Whitman : Yes. So, listen, as always it\u2019s a very competitive environment out there. And I can just sort of start at the top. I think, Cisco is aggressive, but we\u2019ve seen some weakening in ECS and BCE. They are not as aggressive as they were probably two \u2013 18 months to two years ago. Dell/EMC, it\u2019s hard for us to tell how well Dell/EMC is doing, because of course, they\u2019re not a public company anymore. But we like our win rate. We like the \u2013 we like our strategy of getting smaller and more focused, while they\u2019re still integrating a very large acquisition. And Lenovo, we intercepted a huge amount of server volume in the move from IBM to Lenovo, and we haven\u2019t seen them pop back yet. I don\u2019t ever count Lenovo out, okay. So they may be just about ready to get up off the math here, but we\u2019ll see in the next 6 to 18 months. And then we\u2019re actually seeing some Huawei pressure in Latin America and a little bit in Europe, not in the United States, a little bit in Europe, quite a bit in Latin America, and we\u2019re trying to basically make sure that, in my view, it\u2019s easier to hold share than to gain it back. And so we\u2019re making some investments in areas that they\u2019re trying to make inroads into. So that they don\u2019t create a profit pool from which they can leap to another country. I think, one of the advantage is, Shannon, of the separation is, people used to ask me, who is my list of competitors, and there would be 20 people on that list. This is a much smaller group of competitors, including the public cloud competitors to some degree, and we can be much more laser like focused, and in the volume business, we act very quickly from a pricing perspective, from of our broad perspective, probably much more quickly than we could have before, and that actually helps us, as we think about pricing in a particular region or a particular product line. Shannon Cross : Thanks. And then if you can talk a little bit more about China in terms of what you\u2019re seeing there, obviously, it\u2019s the [Beijing large] [ph] joint venture, but I\u2019m curious there at least in delay deals that we\u2019re waiting for the \u2013 for it to close, now it is closed and you\u2019ve gotten through it. I\u2019m curious as to what you\u2019ve heard from them? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Well, I\u2019ll start off and let Tim weigh in. So first of all we are thrilled that we have done this deal with Tsinghua University. It is much better to 49% of a leading player in China then owned a 100% of an American-owned subsidiary. And I think you\u2019ve seen a lot of our competitors try to figure out how they can replicate that deal. I also think depending on what happens with the trade relations between the U.S. and China, we\u2019re going to be thrilled to death that we are in a partnership with Tsinghua University. They are running the company as a very local Chinese company. We like their CEO. Their networking business is doing really well, and they\u2019re integrating now our storage and server business. So we\u2019re optimistic. They\u2019re sort of early kinks in some ways, they\u2019re working out running this very big company that they\u2019ve absorbed and they\u2019ve got some integration issues. But overall, we\u2019re really pleased with the joint venture. Tim Stonesifer : I would just say from a financial perspective, if you look at the Q4 equity interest, it was about $31 million. So if you recall in the third quarter that number was a little bit lower as we were running through some one-time accounting items. So we\u2019re much more at a normalized run rate now. So we expect that to continue to improve, as we get into 2017. Meg Whitman : And we\u2019re still involved in the company. I mean, there\u2019s a Board meeting once every quarter. In Hong Kong, where we go over the plan and how we can help them be successful and learnings from the rest of the globe, and how they make that their own in a local Chinese market. So I think, it\u2019s working as well as we possibly could have expected. And again, I got to tell you, I think, we may be very, very glad that we\u2019re in a Chinese joint venture, as the dynamics change across the globe here. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Shannon. I think, we have time for one more question, please? Operator : Certainly. Our last question comes from Rod Hall from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start off, Meg, to just ask you to characterize the economic environment that you\u2019re operating in the quarter you just reported in the fourth quarter, we saw a lot of weakness from other enterprise exposed companies like Cisco and Intel so on. So there are a lot of people calling on enterprise spending weakness. I know you\u2019ve talked about comps and some of the other puts and takes around the numbers. But I\u2019d just be curious to know what you\u2019ve hearing back from your counterparts and your discussions with your customers about their spending thinking at this point in the game? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up? Meg Whitman : Sure. So, listen, I would characterize this quarter as uneven global demand. But I have to say, I\u2019ve been characterizing the last three or four years the uneven global demand. This feels like the new normal to me. There will be spots that do better, spots that are not as good as last quarter. And my view is, our performance is entirely in our own hands, yes, we\u2019re influenced by the global demand. But I wouldn\u2019t use that as a \u2013 as an excuse for performance or even a buttress performance. We need to deliver the innovation, continued to deliver on our go-to-market, and gain share as we have for virtually every single quarter. And so, I wouldn\u2019t take our guidance for next year to be influenced one way or the other about the global demand. This is what we think we can do, given the environment that we\u2019ve been into last four or five years. Rod Hall : Okay. I guess what I was looking forward there is whether you saw any deterioration in overall demand in the quarter, because obviously numbers are a little bit disappointing. And then the follow-up question I had for you is the server unit numbers, at least, preliminary numbers for Q3 are down. So there\u2019s a deterioration in the overall server market and yet you guys are thinking 1% to 2% growth next year. And I just wonder how optimistic you have to be about the overall market next year considering the demand situation seems to deteriorate here? Meg Whitman : Yes. So, listen, as I said before what we\u2019re saying is in the core ISS business, there is some deterioration. What I would characterize is core ISS rack for us, other parts of the server business are doing really well. And I think that core ISS rack deterioration has a number of different things. One is in part our execution in the channel and pricing and things like that. And the second is to move to the public cloud. I mean, we\u2019re definitely seeing some impact there offset by growth in other areas. From a 1% to 2% range, my view is from our perspective, that\u2019s a revenue number and longer-term. And remember our revenues are holding up better than the units because of our high attach. And then also the features and functionality that we add on to those servers, whether that\u2019s storage or whatever happens to be. So again, we look at \u2013 when we look at unit share, we look at revenue share and we also look at share profits and we are gaining share profits in this business, which is actually really important. So that\u2019s kind of the way we think about it. So I think actually 1% to 2% feels pretty reasonable to me. We\u2019ve got some work to shore up that ISS rack. But I think well offset by some of the other things that are really going well from an innovation perspective. Rod Hall : Great. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thank you, Rod, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

My name is Denise, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andy Simanek : Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fiscal 2017 first quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s quarter report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2017. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and beginning with fiscal year 2016 are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance, given the significant divestitures we\u2019ve recently completed, including the sale of MphasiS, 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on the website for details. With that, let me turn it over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Let\u2019s start right in. Overall, as I look back on Q1, I\u2019d say our performance was mixed. I was very pleased with our non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $0.45, at the high end of our previously guided range. We delivered normalized free cash flow of $200 million, a $500 million improvement year-over-year. And we saw strong performance across key growth areas of the portfolio. However, we also encountered some unexpected headwinds during the quarter. We saw several external factors impacting our performance that will become more challenging through the remainder of fiscal 2017, and we came up against some execution related problems that we are now fixing. Let me talk a little bit more about the challenges we saw in the quarter and how we think about them. First, we faced a significant challenge on both the top and bottom lines from foreign exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and the yen. We were able to largely address the impact on our profitability in Q1 with our hedging strategy. However, we expect the continued strength of the dollar as these hedges roll off to present a significant headwind for the remainder of the year. Second, we saw an impact from a challenging industry wide commodities market, particularly tight NAND supply which impacted sales in our storage and compute businesses and elevated DRAM pricing. We were able to mitigate a portion of the impact in Q1 through procurement strategies. However, we expect that the increase in DRAM pricing will accelerate and create near-term challenges to our profitability. Third, revenue was impacted by a tough market environment, particularly in core servers and storage. We saw a significantly lower demand from one customer and major tier 1 service provider facing a very competitive environment. Finally, we experienced some execution issues in the Enterprise Group business. So, let me say a little bit more about that. As you know, during the past few months, we\u2019ve been preparing HPE to compete aggressively following the spin mergers of ES and software. To that end, we\u2019ve been making significant changes to our organization, all during the final intense months before the ES separation and as the software separation done underway. In just the last quarter, we\u2019ve reshaped the entire Enterprise Group business to better drive the three pillars of our strategy, hybrid IT; the intelligent edge; and services. We appointed a new Global Head of Sales and new sales leads in each of our geographical regions. We hired a new leader for the Technology Services business, and we hired a new leader for our channel program. These are the some of the more significant changes we\u2019ve made to set the Company up for long-term success. While these changes were the right changes to make, it was a lot for the organization to take in. Frankly, as we headed into Q1, we overloaded many of our top people and disrupted the day-to-day cadence of our business more than we should have. The good news is that we\u2019ve indentified the problem and are fixing it. More importantly, once the dust settles, the changes we\u2019ve made will leave HPE in a much better position to compete and win. Now, while we faced a number of headwinds in the quarter, we also continued to see positive momentum across a number of fronts. In the Enterprise Group, I was very pleased with our focus on the critical, higher margin, higher market growth areas of the portfolio that will be the foundation of our futures success. We delivered strong results in technology, services support and consulting, Aruba, high-performance compute, and all-flash storage. And this focus drove improved year-over-year operating margins in EG when adjusted for currency and divestitures. We also made strong progress in Enterprise Services where we continued to shift headcount to lower cost locations, and the operating margin came in at a solid 7% within our long-term target range. And software continued to stabilize revenue and improved operating margins by 400 basis points. At the same time, throughout Q1, we continued to execute strategic acquisitions, invested in innovation and developed important partnerships. All of these actions were directly aligned to the three pillars of our strategy, hybrid IT; the intelligent edge; and services. In our mission to make hybrid IT simple for our customers, we completed the acquisition of SimpliVity, a leading provider of software defined hyperconverged infrastructure. Our hyperconverged market is approximately $2.4 billion and is growing around 25% annually. So, we see this as a significant opportunity. By bringing together HPE\u2019s simple user interface developed for our HC 380 solution with SimpliVity\u2019s enterprise class data fabric, HPE will deliver the industry\u2019s best and most comprehensive hyperconverged offering on the market. This world-class technology combined with HPE\u2019s unmatched global go-to-market is a game-changer in the hyperconverged space. We just closed the deal on Friday, and I\u2019m pleased that we received our first order on the same day. Customers can clearly see the promise. In high-performance compute, we accelerated our momentum since closing the SPI deal late last year. Overall, the high-performance compute segment is an $11 billion market and is expected to grow around 6% to 8% annually over the next three years. And with the explosion of data across industries and sectors, the data analytic segment is growing at over twice that rate. Over the past several weeks, I\u2019ve been meeting with customers and it\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that SPI and our existing high performance computing business make a very powerful combination. Just this quarter, we announced a number of new offerings for sectors including life sciences and financial services as well as significant new supercomputer installations that are driving advances in space exploration, biology and artificial intelligence. We\u2019ll continue to lean into this space, as HPC becomes an essential component in today\u2019s data-driven world. And earlier this month, we introduced one of our most significant 3PAR flash storage innovations to-date, the next gen 3PAR operating system, which provides a foundation for hybrid IT as all-flash becomes the new norm. In December, we announced HPE Synergy with HPE Helion CloudSystem 10, the industry\u2019s first private cloud running on composable infrastructure. This new solution gives organizations the ability to operate a single IT environment on-prem that supports both traditional applications and product clouds on shared infrastructure. It gives customers the security and control of an on-prem at public cloud economics. That is a game-changing combination. Finally, we continued to deepen relationships with existing partners like Arista and introduced new ones as well. For example, in Q1, we announced a new reseller agreement with Mesosphere. HPE will build and deliver infrastructure solutions specifically designed for the Mesosphere data center operating system. For HPE, the agreement with Mesosphere shows how committed we\u2019re to helping enterprise customers fully embrace the benefits they want from hybrid IT including optimized performance and faster service time to market. Turning to the next pillar of our strategy, we believe the intelligent edge and the industrial Internet of Things represents a significant opportunity for our business going forward. We\u2019re very well-positioned with Aruba today and continue to make investments to strengthen our portfolio for the future. In late November, Aruba announced several new security solutions, ecosystem partnerships and switching products designed to accelerate the move to the digital workspace while addressing the security concerns associated with the adoption of IoT. For example, the new Aruba ClearPass Universal Profiler gives IT organizations unparalleled multi-device management and security options across multi-vendor wired and wireless networks. And Aruba\u2019s latest switches and switch operating system are specifically designed to power and security intelligent edge optimized for mobile and IoT devices. And in Q1, we acquired Niara to help our customers detect and protect themselves against advanced cyber attacks that have penetrated their network parameter defenses. Niara is a leader in a new category of products that employ machine learning and big data analytics on enterprise packet and log streams to discover advanced attacks. By integrating Niara\u2019s behavioral analytics technology with Aruba\u2019s ClearPass policy manager, we can now offer our customers the industry\u2019s most advanced threat detection and prevention solutions for networks and IoT devices. Finally, today more than ever, our customers are looking for a trusted advisor to help them define and implement an IT roadmap specific to their business needs. Services is at the core of our ability to be that strategic partner to our clients and its role in our business is crucial. In Q1, we announced the acquisition of Cloud Cruiser, a leading provider of cloud consumption analytic software that provides clear insight into IT usage and spend, and helps customers more effectively plan and manage their IT systems. This acquisition will further differentiate our Flexible Capacity offering, which as you know is the unique consumption model that enables our customers to manage IT infrastructure in their own data center but pay for it as a service. This approach reduces the risk of organizations investing too much or too little in IT, eliminates unused capacity and frees up valuable IT resources for new value-adding projects. In the coming months, we will be speaking more to our customers about our services strategy, leading that charge will be Ana Pinczuk, who joined HPE just last week from Veritas, where she most recently held the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer and for many years and Cisco prior to that. As a seasoned leader with 30 plus years of experience, Ana brings a wealth of services expertise combined with a versatile background in engineering, sales and IT. The best way to judge our strategy is through our customers. And our customer wins in Q1 gave us great confidence that we\u2019re on the right path. In January, the Tokyo Institute of Technology awarded HPE for the significant supercomputer win to address increasing demand for big data and artificial intelligence capabilities in research communities. Suncor Energy has signed a five-year Flexible Capacity service agreement. Flexible Capacity provides Suncor with benefits of a cloud-like consumption model and the performance and security afforded by having these resources on-perm.  We are working with Giant Tiger, Canada\u2019s leading discount retailer who is implementing HPE Synergy to help consolidate and power their next generation 600,000 square foot state-of-the-art distribution center. Distribution and warehousing are core functions of the Giant Tiger business model and HPE Synergy will transform distribution operations with HPE Aruba wireless and 3PAR storage technology to run warehouse robotics. And next week at Mobile World Congress, we plan to announce a major smart cities project in India, involving the world\u2019s largest long range low-power wireless IoT platform deployment. Overall, I would love to have seen better top line results in the quarter and we could have done without the market and execution headwinds I described earlier. But I remain very confident in our strategy. Nothing has changed my fundamental belief that HPE is on the right track. In fact, I believe we are ahead of many of our competitors in reorganizing to deal with the market challenges we all face. The steps we are taking to strengthen our portfolio, streamline our organization and build the right leadership team are setting us up to win long into the future. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks, Meg. As is said earlier, our overall performance in the quarter was somewhat mixed. We did drive solid growth in our higher margin businesses and continued to align our cost structure, which enabled us to deliver better operating profit versus the prior year. However, we also faced increasing pressures from currency, commodities pricing and soft markets in addition to the execution issues Meg discussed. In total, revenue of $11.4 billion was down 4% when adjusted for currency and divestitures. From a macro perspective, we continue to see an uneven global demand environment. Performance in the U.S. was impacted by tough markets, particularly in servers and storage. Revenue in Europe continues to be weak, driven by the UK public sector. APJ was mixed with good performance in Japan, more than offset by broad softness in the rest of Asia. Currency movements were unfavorable throughout the quarter, which resulted in a year-over-year impact of revenue of 140 basis points. Gross margin of 28.9% was up 50 basis points year-over-year but down 150 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to continued progress on the offshore labor mix of Enterprise Services. The sequential margin drop was driven by normal Q1 seasonality in ES and software. Non-GAAP operating profit of 9.2% was up 110 basis points year-over-year but down a 190 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.45 was at the high end of our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS primarily excludes pretax amounts for separation charges of $276 million, restructuring charges of $177 million and amortization of intangible assets of $111 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.16, above our previously provided outlook of $0.03 to $0.07, primarily due to lower than expected separation and restructuring charges. Now, turning to results by business. In the Enterprise Group, revenue was down 6% as we continue to focus on profitability and align the organization for future stay. Operating margins were down 70 basis points year-over-year and 60 basis points sequentially to 12.7%. However, operating margins were up year-over-year, adjusted for currency and the H3C divestiture. We had several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio including Aruba, up 20%; 3PAR all-flash arrays, up 29%; high-performance compute, up more than 30% including the acquisition of SGI and almost 10% organically, and 4% growth in our highest operating margin business, Technology Services. Server revenue declined 11% due to a softer than expected core server market combined with some execution challenges. And as Meg said, we saw lower demand from our largest tier 1 customer. We already have several actions in place to help sure up our core business. First, we\u2019re making improvements in the channel with some process reengineering, and focusing more on SMBs through distributors and value-added resellers. Second, we\u2019re continuing to make investments in products like Synergy that will revitalize our competitiveness and belief. In addition to organic investments, we\u2019ve also augmented our portfolio with the recent acquisitions of SGI and SimpliVity, which will strengthen our position in two high growth markets. Lastly, we continue to focus on cost takeout by flattening new organization, better aligning R&D to the market opportunities and improving the go-to-market model. Storage revenue declined 12% in a market that remains challenged, and we faced sales execution issues similar to our core server business. Results were also meaningful impacted by NAND supply constraints that we\u2019re expecting to lessen as the year progresses. We also recently announced a simplified pricing model and bundled compression offerings with 3PAR that should help to improve win rates and stabilize revenue going forward. Networking revenue grew 6%, driven by Aruba hardware that continues to take share and was especially strong in EMEA with several large new logo wins. We also saw growth in campus and branch switching, but data center networking revenue continues to be pressured. We\u2019re in the process of transitioning from our legacy portfolio to the new Arista partnership that is starting ramp. Technology Services continues to be a bright spot with revenue up 4%. Orders also grew year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, giving us strong confidence that TS will grow throughout fiscal year 2017. We saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services as well as Aruba services which was up more than 10%. We also continue to improve service intensity, or attach dollars per unit, which helps to offset pressure from challenged hardware performance. We\u2019re very pleased to see TS grow, given its relatively high degree of profitability and recurring revenue stream. Enterprise Services revenue declined 6%, with continued challenges in the UK public sector and normal account runoff. Operating profit improved 220 basis points year-over-year to 7%, as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements, and delivery and sales. We continue to track against our longer term goal of 60% headcount in low cost locations and completed the quarter with 52% of our headcount in low cost centers, a year-over-year improvement of seven points. Software revenue was down 1% as strength in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. SaaS had another good quarter with 6% revenue growth, driven by solid performance in Fortify on Demand and Digital Safe. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, leading to a 400 basis-point improvement in operating margins to 21.4%. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 7%, its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth driven by strong volume from last year and an increase in operating lease mix. Operating profit declined 340 basis points year-over-year to 9.5%, primarily due to a bad debt reserve release in the prior year. Financing volume declined 9% in constant currency on a tough compare from a onetime item associated with the split form HPI. Return on equity was down 490 basis points year-over-year to 13.1%. Free cash flow, which is seasonally weakest in the first quarter, was negative $2.3 billion. However, when adjusted for the $1.9 billion of ES pension funding, roughly $300 million of restructuring and $300 million of separation payments, normalized free cash flow was approximately positive $200 million. This improvement of approximately $500 million from the prior year is due primarily to less drag from working capital as we continue to see the benefit from structural changes we implemented in cash flow management. Within the quarter, we also benefitted from movements in other assets and liabilities, which is expected to reverse in the second quarter. The cash conversion cycle was 12 days, up 6 days sequentially, in line with normal seasonality. Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we paid $109 million in dividend payments, which includes an 18% increase to $0.065 per share and repurchased $641 million of outstanding shares, aligned to our commitments at our Securities Analyst Day. Now, moving to our two spin-merge transactions. Both the ES, CSC and software Micro Focus transactions are on schedule and on budget. We filed an updated Form 10 and S4 for the ES, CSC transaction and anticipate filing final version shortly with the expected close still on or around April 1st. The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on September 1st. We\u2019ve also made good progress removing stranded costs and continue to anticipate a $0.06 diluted EPS impact in fiscal year 2017 with all costs eliminated on a run-rate basis by the end of the year. Now turning to our outlook, when we look back to original outlook provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October of 2016, there have been three significant developing headwinds, currency; commodity pricing; and some execution issues. In regards to currency, the euro is currently hovering at a $1.06 versus a $1.10 when we originally guided fiscal year 2017 and we now expect FX to be roughly a two-point impact to revenue year-over-year. And as Meg discussed, while profitability was hedged through the first quarter, we will face a headwind for the remainder of the year. We\u2019re managing the challenge as much as possible through pricing actions but it often takes many quarters to recoup the full impact. From a memory standpoint, prices increased roughly 50% last month, putting significant margin pressure on the Enterprise Group. We can mitigate some of this movement through pricing actions but similar to currency, the extent of the mitigation is dependent on many factors, including competition and demand. So, it will take some time for us to work through the challenge. Lastly, the EG execution issues will have some near-term impact, which should alleviate throughout the year as we move quickly to resolution. Consequently, we feel it\u2019s prudent to reduce our fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.12 in order to continue making the appropriate investments to secure the long-term success of the business. I view these headwinds as more temporary in nature and expect to recapture much of their impact through pricing actions. With that, we expect Q2 2017 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41 to $0.45, and we expect fiscal year 2017 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to now be $1.88 to $1.98 from the prior outlook of $2 to $2.10. From a GAAP perspective, we expect Q2 2017 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.03 to $0.01, and we expect fiscal year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share to now be $0.60 to $0.70 from the prior outlook of $0.72 to $0.82. Keep in mind that this EPS outlook reflects the combined Company as it stands today with full year contributions from ES and software since we haven\u2019t yet closed the transactions. As is our typical practice, we\u2019ll update our outlook when we close each transaction. However, I do want to give you some information on how to think about the ES impact since the close is quickly approaching. We expect the ES transaction to impact fiscal year 2017 EPS by approximately $0.42 including ES related stranded costs. We also want to highlight that ES only earns roughly one-third of its operating profit in the first two months of the given quarter as most customer milestones are in the last months. Consequently, we expect the ES transaction will impact Q2 2017 EPS by approximately $0.08 including ES related stranded costs. Also, similar to the separation of HPE and HPI, the spinoff of ES will likely cause a one-time non-cash GAAP-only charge in the second quarter from certain changes to our legal structure. The details of these changes are still being finalized. So, we\u2019ve not incorporated the impact to our GAAP outlook, but we expect them to result in a material write-down of deferred tax assets. Finally, turning to cash flow. While this reduction in earnings outlook does put some pressure on cash flow, we\u2019re now expecting reduced ES pension funding payments and we\u2019ll maintain our full year fiscal year 2017 free cash flow outlook of negative $1.8 billion. As mentioned earlier, we do expect some of the timing benefits we saw in Q1 to reverse next quarter, so our Q2 free cash flow will likely be below seasonal norms. Overall, while we\u2019re working through some near-term challenges, like Meg, I\u2019m confident that we have an effective near-term action plan as well as the right long-term strategy in place to position the future HPE for success. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Thank you. If I look at the server and storage performance this quarter, the numbers were pretty disappointing, and there seem to be a pretty significant deceleration. I think the bears would say that the cloud model is taking more share and that\u2019s pressuring your core business. Can you maybe comment on your view about how much the cloud is impacting your server and storage business? Meg Whitman : Sure. So, listen, I think the cloud is impacting our server and storage business, but no more than we thought at the beginning of the year. And really, if you look at the server business per se and our results, within tier 1, we had a much lower demand from a single large customer that I discussed on the call. And we were also more selective around focusing on profitable deals. And the good news is that helped server margins year-over-year but it did depress the revenue a bit. I think we did deliver strong growth in a number of our higher margin, better attach areas like high-performance compute, mission critical systems and the addition of SGI. And the good news is we also have some things coming up that I think will mitigate that decline. We\u2019re ramping our Synergy offering, we\u2019ve got the power of SGI and our high-performance compute that was part of HPE. We are also pursuing alliances very aggressively. When we owned ES, yes, we did some business with Accenture and Capgemini and the Indian firms, but they were always quite vary of us because they viewed us as owning a competitor. As ES gets spun off, there is a lot more opportunity for us to do business with those partners. And I think that will help mitigate the decline. So, listen, I mean, I\u2019m optimistic that these actions will enable us to stabilize servers in FY17. I\u2019ll also say that Synergy is important because Synergy allows us to provide on-perm private cloud alternatives at public cloud economics, both the total cost of ownership as well as the consumption based pricing model. And we\u2019ve seen a number now of customers move workloads off the public cloud back into an on-perm datacenter because it\u2019s more cost effective. So that\u2019s the server apart. Storage was challenged, I think by a continued contraction in traditional portfolio. Remember, we still have tape and some very old storage products that are in decline. And we also were impacted by SSD supply constraints. But on the positive side, all-flash grew almost 30% and would have been considerably higher than that without the SSD supply constraints. And then, we also announced a simplified pricing model and bundled compression offerings with 3PAR that was previously actually a competitive hole in our product. So, I think we\u2019ve got -- one last thing is of course with the SimpliVity acquisition, we got now a whole new group of storage sellers where we can have broader market coverage, and we\u2019d become a more scale in that area. So, listen, there are real pressures, no question about it, but I don\u2019t think particularly more than we thought there was going to be in the quarter. Sherri Scribner : And then, just as my follow-up. You took the full-year guidance down by about $0.12, but if you look at the first half, it doesn\u2019t seem like there was that much impact to the first half whereas most of the impact will be in the second half. Can you talk about the linearity of the FX impact and the commodity impact that you guys mention as being part of the takedown in guidance. Thank you. Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So, if you look at FX as an example, we have a rolling hedge program, we do that by country; we do that by product. So, what you are seeing is the hedges that we put in place, call it six to nine months ago, which were favorable as they were all rolled up in Q1. So, there was no real impact from an EPS perspective driven by foreign exchange. And then when you look at DRAM pricing as an example that increased about 50% in the month of January. So, again, we had some supply built up or it\u2019s an inventory built up, so you don\u2019t see the full effect of that. So, you will see both, the FX and the commodity pricing flow through the rest of the year. Now we\u2019re going to try to price for some of that; we\u2019ve gone out with price increases; and it\u2019s really a question of what would the impact be to demand and what would be the competitive response. So, you will sort of see a flow through I would say, and sort of typical seasonality. Meg Whitman : Sherri, let me add one thing about EPS takedown of about $0.12. So, when you think about commodities and you think about foreign exchange that was about -- we estimate about $0.12 of degradation. And the decision we had to make is did we want to cut $0.12 more of cost out of our cost structure. And as you all know, we\u2019ve been taking a lot of cost out of this Company over the last four and a half years. And my view was, we\u2019ve got very good investments in field selling costs, in innovation, in automation, in IT, that it\u2019s going to put us in very good stead for the long term. And I did not think it was the right thing to do to absorb all of that commodities and foreign exchange degradation by cutting more costs into what I think are going to be very high return on -- return on investment projects. So, we decided actually that the best long-term thing for the Company was to not cut into bone and meat. Operator : The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. At your Analyst Day and also on your earnings call at the end of the year, you provided three sets of the guidance, one for HPE as is which quite frankly is completely irrelevant at this point, given that you\u2019re going to be spinning off services, and you also provided guidance of $1.45 to $1.55 for the current year and $1.25 to $1.35 in EPS for Remain Co. Can you provide updated guidance for Remain Co go forward and current year? And I guess the question is, given that the erosion appears to be all in the Enterprise Group, in fact software and services were better than my numbers, should we be thinking about lowering the current year $1.45 to $1.55 by $0.12 and thinking of Remain Co earnings thereafter as being notably lower than the $1.25 to $1.35, and why not? Tim Stonesifer : So, let me take a cut at that. So, we did guide the $2 to $2.10 as a combined company, because again similar to prior practices, until we actually separate, we will provide that outlook and then we\u2019ll adjust that outlook once the transactions have closed. So, to your -- to one of your questions around the as reported guide, the takedown would apply to that, so the $1.45 to $1.55 would go down by $0.12 on both ends -- in terms of the range. And again, that\u2019s primarily driven by the FX, commodity pricing and some execution challenges. When you look at the $1.25 to $1.35 number, from an ongoing perspective, because obviously we\u2019re not going to report that guide on a quarterly basis, it does have the 2017 assumptions in there. I think you\u2019ll still get within that range longer term. It really depends on how those price increases that we\u2019ve executed, how those take. So, the more that they take, you\u2019d be up at the higher end of that range; if they don\u2019t take given demand or competitive response, you\u2019d be at the lower end of that range. Toni Sacconaghi : And then, just to follow-up, if I go back to when you last reported earnings in late November, the currency bundle really hasn\u2019t changed much. And I appreciate that DRAM pricing has changed in the month of January. But, I think most people were aware of a much-tougher commodity environment in November, in fact your sister company HPQ had been calling that out before November and it made provisions to adjust for that, both in pricing and in building inventory. So, I guess the question is, the only thing that really seems new or that you shouldn\u2019t have known about, was either the market changing or execution. Did you -- were you aware of this? I\u2019m sure you were aware in November; did you just think you could overcome them and that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t update your guidance at the end of November or should we really be thinking that the market and your execution are really what the material differentiators are in terms of your choosing to lower the guidance now as opposed to in November when at least two of the forces were very apparent? Tim Stonesifer : Yes. So, I\u2019ll address that one and Meg, you can jump in here if you would like. So, let\u2019s start with FX. I think to your point, we guided in October for the full year 2017 outlook at SAM. So, at that point in time, the euro was trading at call at 1.10; and the yen, which has another significant impact was trading at about 103. When we came out on the fourth quarter earnings call, we did highlight that there was some pressure. So, we got a question, I can\u2019t remember who asked it. And we said yes, rates are less favorable than they were. I think at that point in time, the euro was about 1.06 and the yen as was at about 110, 111. But given the fact that we were three weeks into the year, given the fact that we were rolling into a new administration in the U.S. and we weren\u2019t quite sure how that was going to play out, as well as the fact that we had hedges in place that protected the first quarter, we decided to continue to monitor the currency environment, we would make some operational changes that we thought were appropriate. And that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t change the guide down. As we sit here today, we\u2019re now five months into the year, and that euro is still sitting at about 1.06; the yen is still sitting at about 112. So, we felt it was prudent to adjust our guide now. And it\u2019s really -- it was a cognitive choice that Meg alluded to, is we had choices that we evaluated and we decided this was a prudent thing to do, so we could continue to drive the strategy, we continue to make the strategic investments that will drive long-term value. So, that\u2019s the foreign exchange piece. And then, on the DRAM piece, those prices spiked in January, about 50% in January. We did do some advanced purchases in the fourth quarter but there was only so much you could buy because everybody sort of was facing the same thing, and there is only a limited amount of capacity. So again that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t see a lot of that pressure in our Q1 EPS because we were using inventory that we bought at lower pricing. And that\u2019s something that will continue to play out in Q2, Q3 and Q4. I mean, it depends on how the capacity comes on line. And we really don\u2019t see the foreign exchange changing drastically as we go forward as well. So, hopefully, that answers your question. Operator : The next question will be from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder Garcha : Just a couple of clarifications really, maybe for Meg. I think you\u2019ve talked about your TAM growing to 2% to 3% and at constant currency, backing out acquisitions et cetera, I think you\u2019ve hit a growth rate in that range or above that range about half the time since separation and half the time that hasn\u2019t been possible, since you\u2019ve separated. And that\u2019s a reasonable amount of time now. I\u2019m just wondering, do you still believe in that growth that the industry participants, do you think HPE can consistently hit those numbers? Does something maybe have to change on the M&A front to accelerate that growth in the revenue side? That\u2019s kind of my first question. And then, the second one on restructuring and cost savings, the fact that you\u2019re choosing not to take more cost out given the current challenges that you\u2019re seeing, is this -- does that also tell us that the efficiency drive and the inefficiency that HPE may have had in its cost now and it\u2019s going to be much more difficult balancing act between projects you want to keep and eliminating this redundant cost? Meg Whitman : Yes. Okay. So, let me address the growth question. I think you\u2019re probably right that we\u2019ve grown about the half the quarter since we separated. And you\u2019ve got to look at first what is going to be the go forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise as opposed to also the whole company because in much of the last year, obviously Enterprise Services was more of a drag than EG was. But, let me answer the question about go forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise 2017, which is EG plus HPE Financial Services. I would say, yes. I think we can return to growth but there is one caveat that I would make and that is a single tier 1 service provider who was a big customer of our, slowing down orders dramatically. But for the rest of the business, ex that large single tier 1 service provider, I think we\u2019ve set ourselves up well to be prepared to tackle the future. I like our portfolio. We\u2019ve really reshaped this portfolio both inorganically as well as organically. I think you should feel very good about TS. Remember, over the last three or four years, there was a lot of question, could we return TS to growth? And orders precursors revenue we\u2019ve seen orders grow and the last couple of quarters you\u2019ve seen revenue grow and orders grew again this quarter. So, we\u2019re very confident about the TS growth rate, and of course that happens to carry a much higher margin than our infrastructure products. Aruba continues to do very well and as I said, some of our other high growth areas. So, I\u2019m going to say yes, with the possible exception of the tier 1, the single tier 1 service provider and that could throw us into slightly negative growth for 2017. On the cost out, so, listen, we have taken a lot of cost out of this Company. We\u2019ve improved the efficiencies, the business process reengineering. And by the way, embedded in our forecast for 2017 is all the reshaping that we did around Remain Co; costs are coming out. We\u2019ve totally reshaped how that business is run with far fewer layers and much more efficiency. So that will continue. I do think after we\u2019re separated, there\u2019s going to be potentially some more cost to come out. Right now, we\u2019re carrying almost the full IT load because the IT team is doing all the separations. We\u2019ll skinny down IT. Obviously some of IT will go to software, some will obviously go to CSC. So, I think that will help us. And then there\u2019s some other things that we can go after, but I have to say, quite honestly, the low-hanging fruit is gone. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. Just to elaborate on that a little bit, if you look at our OpEx for Q1, we were down year-over-year about $340 million. Now, granted, we have the TippingPoint divestiture, so I\u2019ll call it from an operational basis, it\u2019s roughly $220 million. So, we do have a lot of cost takeout in the plan; we\u2019re executing upon that. I think when we get to -- when we talk a little bit about this at some point, when you get to the Q4 of 2017, we do this benchmarking as an example on all of our functions. From a run rate perspective, we\u2019ll be at that benchmark, except for the IT and the real estate component. So, again, it takes us a little bit of time to get through these separations and then we can really zero in on the IT and the real estate front to continue to capitalize on those savings. But, I think our view is there\u2019s always opportunity for cost, it\u2019s just a question of how much and how quickly can you take that out. And right now, we feel like we\u2019re taking out quite a bit of cost. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Hey, Meg, could you talk a bit more about these management changes? You mentioned the Head of Sales -- the Head of TS, who I thought was supposedly doing a great job; you\u2019ve always spoken very highly of him, and all these GEOs. I mean, it seems to kind of coincide with the spins-offs but I don\u2019t know why that would affect a lot movement around EG. So, maybe you could talk about some of the individuals involved and why all the changes? Meg Whitman : Sure. So, remember, as we go forward as Remain Co, if you will, which is EG plus HPE FS, we need to set up EG to be a very lean and cost effective competitor because this way in Europe we compete against the Chinese, obviously this is a very, very competitive market. So, we wanted to reorganize ourselves in a way that we thought would be much more cost effective and more efficient. And the first was, we appointed Peter Ryan to be the new Head of Global Sales. We\u2019ve actually never had a Head of Global Sales. He is now the Head of Global Sales and he has got three new regions heads, Jim Merritt, who used to be in Asia and did a fantastic job for us in Asia, has come back to the United States; and then we promoted Andy Isherwood to be the Head of Europe, who filled in behind Peter Ryan because he had been Head of Europe. So, I\u2019ve got three new region heads plus a new -- Peter being a new Head of Global Sales. They are not new to HP, but they are new in their roles. Secondarily, we have now real plans to grow TSS, which is our Technology Services Support business as well as TS Consulting. So, Scott Weller still runs TSS; Rafael Brugnini still runs TSC, but we have hired someone to take both of those businesses and really drive growth overall in the services business because we\u2019ve got to grow our advisory and transform service; we have to grow our support services business as we have in the past, and there is a lot of opportunity in some of the new products, particularly around Flexible Capacity Services. So, we hired a new executive named Ana Pinczuk, who is going to be in charge of all services, Scott Weller\u2019s still in place and we think very highly of Scott, and Rafael Brugnini is still in place. We also hired a new leader for our channel program. We had a fellow who was hired in a number of years ago, who actually did a very good job for us but was really focused on selling cloud services. And so, we actually hired a fellow by the name of Denzil Samuels, who has a long history with the channel. He most recently was at GE. And so, he has come in, in the last month or two months to run all the channel worldwide. Yes, Scott Dunsire is still in place in the United States. And so, we\u2019ve got consistency there but we do have a new head of the channel. So, I think all these folks to some degree were also doing double duty. We were making divestitures; we were doing M&A we were doing separations; and Antonio was doing a lot of double duty as well. So, I think the good news is largely that is through the pipeline or to the python, if you will. And I\u2019m feeling pretty good about people settling into to their new roles. But quite frankly, I probably put more change into this organization in Q1 then I probably should have. Tim Stonesifer : And I wouldn\u2019t, I mean, this doesn\u2019t go under the org change category, but I wouldn\u2019t underestimate at the local level the impact on the country leaders which obviously do a lot of selling for us. I mean, when you do a separation like this, you have to go out and speak with customers, you have to explain to them the ES separation from HPE; you have to deal with workers\u2019 councils that they are going to be any organizational changes. So, there is quite a bit of work that kind of ripples through the organization. Meg Whitman : And we\u2019ve got two separations going on now at once. And I\u2019ll add one more thing. When we separated HPI from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, it was one family; there was one adult that was supervising both the separation of the siblings. Now, we\u2019re doing separations, that is a merger with the third-party and that actually adds the complexity that we knew about, but has created some complexity. And by the way the most intense time for the ES separation was in Q1, no question about it. And now, we\u2019re on sort of nice glide path to March 31st. Steve Milunovich : You talked about market\u2019s being difficult, but can you talk a bit about competition, particularly against folks like Cisco, Lenovo? And do you feel like you\u2019re missing a window a bit to take advantage of whatever disruption is happening at Dell EMC? Meg Whitman : No, I think we actually did quite a good job of intercepting that merger, and we\u2019ve recruited a lot of new channel partners, they\u2019re beginning to ramp, a much as we did a good job intercepting the server move from IBM to Lenovo, that we did a very good job intercepting a lot of that business. So, I think we\u2019ve taken advantage of that to some degree. Lenovo is around -- they\u2019ve got their hands full on a couple of other things, the server business and Motorola. But, Dell is being very aggressive, particularly in the server side of things. And we\u2019re countering that. When we think it makes the right sense, we\u2019re not doing share for share sake here but we\u2019re being smart about it. And then in Europe, we actually are seeing the Chinese. We\u2019re seeing Huawei being more aggressive. And we\u2019re trying to avoid what we learnt in the PC business, which is they do the land and expand. If you can keep them from landing, then that is a much better long-term strategy. So, we\u2019re working hard on that too. I\u2019d also say that joint venture in China is actually working quite well. There\u2019s been some growing pains there but actually we\u2019re quite optimistic about that and optimistic about the Shingwa team that is now in charge of that business. And listen, given the trade situation and what may or may not happen with the administration, I\u2019m very glad I\u2019m part of a joint venture in China. Operator : The next question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : When I look at the storage business, a number of the headwinds you\u2019re discussing including the clients in the legacy business and higher commodity prices or dynamics that some of your big competitors also face. And yet when I look at NetApp, the closest public peer, they grew their business 5% sequentially; your storage business declined 12% sequentially. So, that\u2019s a huge gap. And I just wonder if you can talk a little bit more about what changed your momentum so quickly relative to peers, and then what needs to be done to get back on track? Meg Whitman : So, I\u2019d say, listen, the bright spot in the storage portfolio continues to be the all-flash growth, which was almost 30% and it would have been considerably higher if we\u2019d had more SSD supply. So, we\u2019re feeling really good about our all-flash display -- I mean, our all-flash product. Some of the other parts of the business were weaker than probably they should have been. I think I\u2019ll attribute some of that to execution and some of that to market. So, we\u2019re not happy with the storage performance this quarter. I\u2019m quite happy with the all-flash situation but there\u2019s other things that we\u2019re going to buck up as we go forward. So, I think that\u2019s the way I would characterize the quarter. Katy Huberty : And then the weakness at a major tier 1 service provider, can you talk about that little bit more, it\u2019s got a HP year-on-year comp issue or is there just a change in the momentum of buying at that particular customer? Meg Whitman : It\u2019s actually both, it\u2019s a year-over-year comp issue and it is a different buying pattern than have been anticipated. And so, we will see if that corrects over the next two or three, four quarters. Built into our forecast is that it does not correct. So, if it does, that would be an upside. And again, remember, these tier 1 deals, we do make money on them but they are not as profitable as the core ISS. So that doesn\u2019t translate as dynamically into operating profit as it does to revenue. So, they are facing a very competitive business; the tier 1 business is very competitive, and we\u2019ll see what happens there. Operator : The next question will be from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Maynard Um : Within TS, if I exclude the SGI services business, which I presume is in there, I\u2019m calculating that the core TS was maybe down on 2% year-over-year. And I\u2019m just wondering if this is purely a function of slowing hardware or is there slowing in that re-classed ES revenue that you moved in there? And I guess, what I\u2019m really trying to figure out is whether the larger hardware declines that are happening now, will have an adverse impact on TS or if the new services are now growing significantly more? And then, I have a follow-up. Meg Whitman : So, Maynard, the organic TS result was 2.5% in constant currency, 2.5% growth in constant currency. So, we\u2019re actually feeling pretty good about that. And it is driven by the new product acceleration, data center care, proactive care, FSC. And if you go back three or four years on TS, in all rights for a while there that business should have been down 25% a year because it was so driven by our mission critical business. The TS team deserves a huge amount of credit for diversifying the product and actually having that business down only single-digits. Now with the new products coming on line and being actually quite successful, orders are up and we anticipate that business will grow organically, forget adding the SGI services on top of that. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about that business and anticipate we\u2019re going to see growth. Tim Stonesifer : Keep in mind that business -- about 85% of those revenue streams are recurring. So that\u2019s why we are confident in the growth throughout the course of the year. Meg Whitman : Yes. And so, listen, of the lot of the server business that was weak, didn\u2019t have high attach to it anyway. Okay, so, tier 1 service provider has no service attached to it. So, it\u2019s not a drag on our services business. Maynard Um : Great. And then, with the incremental cash you\u2019ll be getting from the divestitures, any guidance on how you intend to use that cash, particularly against the backdrop of the Company being more acquisitive lately, and the possibility for a tax repatriation holiday? Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. So, I think that we are going to continue to execute the returns based capital allocation strategy. We feel like that that\u2019s been working well for us. So, in Q1, as an example, we will return $750 million in cash in the form of share repurchases and dividends. So, we\u2019re still committed to that $3 billion that we\u2019ve talked about at SAM, again in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Now, I will say, we are biased toward share repurchases. But we feel like that framework is working well with us, and we are going to continue to operate within that framework. As far as the repatriation, we haven\u2019t incorporated any of that into our plans because we are not sure what is going to happen, to be quite honest with you. But if there was a onetime holiday as the majority of our cash is offshore, we would certainly benefit from that, like many other companies. But, I would just balance it with, even if we were to see some sort of holiday, I\u2019m not so sure that it would change our returns based approach; I\u2019m not so sure it would change our approach or strategy towards M&A as we go forward. Meg Whitman : I agree with that. I mean, remember what we\u2019ve said is the kind of acquisitions that have worked well for this Company are 3Com, 3PAR, Aruba; SGI is actually going to be very successful and SimpliVity, we\u2019re excited about it; it\u2019s too new to declare a victory, we just closed on Friday. But what do they have in common? They\u2019ve got reasonable valuations; they leverage our distribution channels, they\u2019re complementary technologies and they drive profitable growth. So, I think the best indication of the future is the past. Andy Simanek : Thanks, Maynard. I think we have time for one more question, please. Operator : And that will be Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Just can we go back to the tier 1 service provider? I\u2019m just curious as to whether or not the changes you saw there were basically a slowdown from a capacity need for them or was it a competitive decision, so you\u2019re just facing more competition, maybe from white box? I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out if this is sort of just a one-timer or if there is something fundamentally changing in the business model? Meg Whitman : Yes. I mean, I\u2019m not entirely sure; what I will tell you is that they have dramatically decreased their purchasing below commitments that they had made to us. Shannon Cross : And then, Tim, just a quick clarification, and maybe talk a little bit about cash flow during the year. You gave us few comments on how we should think about it from a linearity standpoint for fiscal second quarter. But, I just wanted to confirm it, so we\u2019re down to $1.9 billion, then what should be the pension funding? And then is there anything -- so, that\u2019s all done now; there won\u2019t be any more coming out I guess in this quarter. And then just how should we think about the opportunity to drive more working capital out of the model? Maybe you\u2019re not going to be cutting costs as much in the P&L but is there more room from a working capital standpoint, as we look forward? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. I\u2019ll just give you a total year perspective. So, our guide, we\u2019re still comfortable with the negative $1.8 billion. We have, to your point, we\u2019ve paid out the $1.9 billion in pension. Now, there\u2019re some more payments to be made because we don\u2019t finalize everything until we close the transaction. But, we do expect that those payments will be less than the $2.5 billion that we\u2019ve communicated at SAM. So, we\u2019ll see some favorability there. The reason why we\u2019re sticking with our guide is because obviously with the $0.12 takedown, that drives some earnings pressure. So, net-net, we still feel very comfortable with the free cash flow guide. As far as working capital, again, we have some timing elements here and there. But I would say overall assumptions over the course of the year have not changed since the guidance we gave at SAM. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Shannon. So, I think with that, thank you everyone for joining today. And we\u2019ll wrap up the call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending.

My name is Lawson, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andy Simanek : Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and beginning with fiscal year 2016 are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance, given the significant divestitures we\u2019ve recently completed, including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details. With that, let me turn it over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. As you know, during the past year and half, we've made significant progress in strengthening HPE to compete and win well into the future. We've been marching towards becoming a smaller, nimbler and financially stronger company that is more committed to customers and partners than ever before. With this call in mind, we separated from HPI in November of 2015 and last month, we spun our enterprise services business and merged it with CSC to form DXC Technology. Completing this transaction was a major milestone in our strategy and I'm proud that we were able to execute such a significant change within the tight schedule we laid out and on budget. Later this summer, we'll complete the spin merger of our software business. The two spin merger transactions will deliver more than $20 billion in value based on the current stock prices of the DXC and Micro Focus. We've also made a number of strategic acquisitions in key growth segments of the market that are directly aligned with the three pillars of our strategy. In November, we acquired SGI, which has cemented our leadership position in the high-performance computing market, which is growing 6% to 8% per year. Earlier this year, we acquired SimpliVity, a leader in hyperconverged, a market growing 25% per year. Niara, a leader in network security that uses machine learning and big data to discover network attacks. We'll make Aruba even stronger. Cloud Cruiser brings IT consumption analytic to our flexible capacity services offering, giving customers clear insight into IT usage and spend and the ability to effectively plan and manage their IT systems and with the addition of Nimble, we now have a complete world-class flash storage portfolio from entry-level to the high end in a market growing around 17% per year. Nimble also brings a simple user experience platform based on predictive analytics that we plan to roll out across our storage portfolio. These were all the right strategic moves for HPE's long-term success, but they were not done in a vacuum. In fact, we've been reengineering our company while facing challenging market conditions, including stiff competition, unfavorable foreign exchange movements and industry-wide commodities constraints. All these challenges have only made us fight harder. In fiscal Q2, we delivered results in line with our outlook, but just as important, we also have shown growth in key areas that portend well for HPE's future. Total Q2 revenue was $9.9 billion, which includes revenue from both continuing operations e.g. financial services and software, as well as two months of enterprise services, which has now accounted for in discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures and currency, driven mainly by reduced server demand from a single tier 1 customer and lower license and professional services sales in software, but absent tier 1 server sales, the future HPE, which excludes enterprise services and software, delivered revenue growth of approximately 1% driven by continued strength in key growth areas. For example, we saw a 20% organic growth in high-performance compute where we are well positioned. All flash storage revenue grew 33% as enterprises move more workloads to flash in order to take advantage of its performance and low latency benefits. Aruba continued to perform well driven by 32% growth in wireless solutions and technology services, which includes our new services brand, Pointnext grew for the fourth consecutive quarter up 3% year-over-year, driven by strong customer demand for our advisory and transformation services as well as data center care. And we overcame most of the execution challenges we discussed on the Q1 call, in particular core servers stabilized with revenue down only 1% globally. Finally, I'm excited about our rapidly growing partnerships with system integrators. While DXC remains a very strong partner to us, we are seeing accelerating demand from other system integrators following the spin of ES. In fact, our overall revenue through these alliance partners saw strong growth in the quarter, up double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific and with certain partners in North America. Our Indian SI partners grew by more than 20% year-over-year, driven by strength in the financial sector, strong demand for our flexible capacity offering as well as the first placements of synergy. Turning to margins, as we discussed on the Q1 call, margins in EG continue to be pressured by DRAM pricing, currency and short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. We also experienced a very competitive pricing environment, which we expect to continue. Tim will talk more about margins in the quarter and going forward; however, let me say that we believe we experienced the worst of the margin pressure in Q2. We believe the situation will improve as we move through the end of the year as we work to mitigate the increased commodity prices and we eliminate stranded costs from the spin mergers and acquisitions. And now that we've completed the ES spin merger, we're taking a fresh look at the cost structure for the new HPE. As a smaller company, it should be much easier to spot opportunities to optimize the business, streamline processes and reduce costs. We believe we can take out another $200 million to $300 million in cost in just the second half of this year. Tim will talk more about this in a minute. With all of that, we delivered non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $0.35 at the midpoint of our previously provided outlook. Looking forward, I remain confident in our strategy for the go-forward HPE. We remain focused on creating a nimbler, faster moving company, committed to the three strategic pillars that are aligned with where the market is moving. First, we make hybrid IT sample. We help customers and partners build the right mix of intelligent software-defined infrastructure that provides speed and agility for business innovation while also reducing cost. For example, high-performance compute is increasingly the answer to managing the expanding amounts of data being created every day. We are seeing strong demand from companies like global chemical company BASF, which recently selected HPE to build one of the world's largest supercomputers based on HPE's Apollo Systems. We also announced an extended partnership with Nvidia to create a portfolio of solutions and services, purpose built for artificial intelligence and deep learning and we continue to be the leading SAP HANA infrastructure and services provider with two times the market share of our next closest rival. Our continued investment in HANA Solutions coupled with our 28-year alliance with SAP, is helping us break into new accounts and drive incremental revenue. On the storage front, we are seeing a rapid shift to all-flash. We're extremely well-positioned here given our leading three-part portfolio and the recent Nimble and SimpliVity acquisition. Just last week, we announced a full refresh of our storage portfolio, designed to give our customers even more options at a variety of price points to help aid their transition to flash storage and we continue to gain momentum with synergy, the industry's first composable infrastructure platform. We now have nearly 400 customers like DreamWorks, Redbox and HudsonAlpha, who have installed Synergy and we expect that to continue to ramp into the end of the year. The second pillar of our strategy is to power the intelligent edge that will run campus branch and industrial IOT applications. Aruba is at the core of this pillar and we've seen accelerating momentum as Aruba leverages HPE's go-to-market. In Q2, Aruba's wireless business grew at three times the market rate with strong demand across industry segments. For example, we had a significant win with the leading global fast-food company as well as major wins in retail, healthcare and education and remember that these Aruba installations pull through high-margin services, often up to twice the value of the hardware and software. As industrial IOT takes off, we're also seeing strong demand for our Edgeline converged systems, which offer compute, storage and analytics at the edge, fully integrated with traditional, operational, technologies such as control and data capture system and industrial networks. Given its small form factor and low energy consumption, Edgeline has been in high demand for the distributed applications that will drive industrial IOT, well of a small base, Edgeline saw significant growth in Q2 and we are seeing a number of promising proof-of-concept programs with major institutions across retail, manufacturing, transportation and smart cities in particular. Finally, we are focused on providing world-class expertise and flexible consumption models to help customers transform their IT environment. HPE Pointnext draws on the expertise of more than 25,000 specialists in 80 countries covering 30 languages and spanning a range of disciplines from cloud consulting to operational services experts. These teams collaborate with businesses worldwide to speed their adoption of emerging technologies, including cloud computing and hybrid IT, big data and analytics, the intelligent edge and Internet of things. We're also seeing strong demand for our datacenter care as customers look to consolidate their datacenter footprints and flexible capacity, which delivers cloudlike consumption models with on premises solutions. During the quarter, we continue to invest in each of these three key areas. As you know, one of the projects we are most excited about is the Machine, which is an entirely new computing architecture that puts memory at the core and in May, we announced the latest milestone in our machine research projects, a powerful prototype that connects 160 terabytes of memory to 1,280 processor cores. In other words, an amount of memory that would hold 80,000 human genomes and simultaneously run anomaly detection algorithms on every core and while this is impressive, the most exciting thing about this milestone is that it demonstrates the ability to scale the architecture to a potentially limitless pool of memory, which is the secret to delivering scientific breakthroughs, industry-changing innovation or life altering technology for the mountains of data we create every day. So overall, despite some current headwinds, I remain very confident in our strategy. We will continue to invest in our three strategic pillars; hybrid IT, the intelligent edge and our Pointnext services model and we will continue to find efficiencies and productivity in the new HPE that will allow us to run the company more profitably with each passing quarter. Next week you'll see some exciting product announcements during our Annual Discover Conference in Las Vegas with thousands of customers and partners join us from around the world for three days of inspiration, learning and networking. I hope to see many of you there. With that, let me turn it over to Tim. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks Meg. As discussed, while our overall performance in Q2 was impacted by tough markets and the external factors I discussed last quarter, we continue to drive growth in our higher margin businesses and align our cost structure with the future HPE operating structure. Total revenue for the quarter was $9.9 billion. This includes $2.5 billion for two months of enterprise services, which is not reported in discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5% adjusted for divestitures and currency driven by declines in software and tier 1 server sales. If you exclude software and tier 1 and consider just the future HPE, revenue was actually up 1%. I'll dive into the business segment performance in a minute. From a macro perspective, we continue to see competitive pricing and a challenging commodities environment. Currency remained unfavorable and was an 80-basis point year-over-year headwind to revenue. HPE's performance in the U.S. was stable excluding tier 1 servers as core servers improved and strong growth and networking was offset by a challenging storage market. Revenue in Europe continue to be weak driven by the U.K. although strong results in Germany helped the region. APJ was mixed with good performance in Japan and India, more than offset by broad softness in the rest of Asia. Turning to margins, gross margin of 33.8% was down 200 basis points year-over-year and down 240 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 7.8% was down 130 basis points year-over-year and down 270 basis points sequentially. As Meg discussed EG margins were negatively impacted by increased DRAM pricing, currency, stranded costs and short-term dilution from the recent acquisitions, as well as a very competitive pricing environment. I'll discuss these in further detail in context of the enterprise group. Combined non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.35 was at the midpoint of our outlook of $0.33 to $0.37. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.25 and $0.10 was from discontinued operations. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations primarily excludes pretax amounts for separation charges of $141 million, restructuring charges of $118 million and amortization of intangible assets of $107 million. GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was negative $0.37 below our previously provided outlook range of negative $0.03 to negative $0.07, primarily due to a one-time non-cash GAAP-only valuation allowance of our U.S. state domestic deferred tax assets resulting from the changes were legal structure related to the spinoff of enterprise services. As a reminder, this was similar in nature to the HPE-HPI separation and discussed as part of our first quarter earnings announcements, but not integrated in our GAAP EPS outlook. Now turning to the results by business. In the enterprise group, revenue was down 7% in a tough market with continued commodities pricing pressure. However, EG revenue grew slightly year-over-year when adjusted for tier 1 sales, driven by several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio. Aruba was up 27%. Three part all-flash arrays were up 33%. High-performance compute grew more than 40% with SGI in over 20% organically and technology services was up 3%. These are some of the areas of the business that we expect to drive profit expansion and topline growth for the future of HPE. That said, operating margins were down 300 basis points year-over-year and 390 basis points sequentially to 8.8%. The margin declines can be broken out into three categories. First, we had structural changes including the year-over-year impact from our H3C divestiture. We now report our remaining stake in equity interests below the operating profit statement line. Q2 will be the last quarter we have a significant compare issue for EG margins related to H3C. Also, we now have stranded costs of our previously allocated to enterprise services, which are now hitting the enterprise group results. These stranded costs are most acute immediately following the spinoff and we will quickly work them down to zero on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal year. Second, we have the short-term dilution impact from our recent acquisitions of SGI, Nimble and SimpliVity. We're moving quickly to reduce their costs. So, all of these acquisitions are accretive in fiscal year '18 and third and most significantly, we continue to be impacted by elevated commodities cost in DRAM and a year-over-year headwind from currency. The pricing environment was also increasingly difficult and hindered our ability to raise prices as an offset. We anticipate the impact from commodities will remain significant in the near-term, but we believe we can begin to mitigate it as we move towards the end of the year. Given these margin pressures, we're taking significant steps to optimize the cost structure of the future HPE and believe we can drive an incremental $200 million to $300 million in cost savings in just the second half of this year. These savings will be a combination of tight control over spending and simplifying the organization through delayering and spend control actions as we become a smaller, more nimble company. Server revenue declined 14% primarily due to tier 1 as we deemphasize the category to focus on more profitable areas. While we'll continue to focus on strengthening our go-to-market, integrating the recent acquisitions into your portfolio and driving targeted organic R&D, we are making solid progress since our stabilization in more profitable core servers, which declined less than 1%. Storage revenue declined 13% driven by continued challenging markets and tight SSD supplies. However, we do expect to maintain share in the high-growth all-flash portion of the market. Our all-flash array growth accelerated this quarter and was up 33% year-over-year and results were still meaningfully impacted by SSD supply constraints. The supply constraints will likely linger in the near-term, which we expect to loosen towards the end of the year. Also, encouragingly, all-flash still has a relatively low penetration rate in the data center and with the recent acquisition of Nimble and the portfolio refresh announced last week, we believe we are very well-positioned to accelerate our customer's journeys to an all-flash datacenter. Networking revenue grew 14% driven by Aruba Wireless Solution, which was up over 30%. Aruba was especially strong in North America with over 100 new logo wins and is expected to take more than two point of share worldwide adjusted for H3C. HPE's campus and branch switching business delivered mid-single digit growth demonstrating that it's combination with Aruba is working. We've also stabilized the datacenter networking business, which grew slightly. Technology services, which includes our newly launched the Pointnext business as well as Aruba Services and CMS, remains a bright spot with revenue up 3%. Orders also grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter giving us strong confidence that TS will grow through the current fiscal year. We saw a strong order performance in consulting with particular strength in network and data center as well as commercial media solutions. We again improved service intensity or attach dollars per unit, which helps offset pressure from declining hardware unit sales. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 11%, its fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, driven primarily by one-time lease conversions and an increase in operating lease mix. We've been pleased with the performance of financial services as it has become strategically more important to our customers as they increasingly value flexible consumption models. Operating profit declined 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.9%, reflecting the increased operating lease mix. Financing volume declined 7% due to the indirect business and return on equity was up 60 basis points year-over-year to 13.5%. Software revenue was down 9% as declines in license and professional services more than offset growth in SaaS as the team works through a transition to Micro Focus. The team continue to focus on disciplined cost controls, leading to an operating margin of 26.4%. This is a 160-basis point improvement year-over-year as reported and their improvement is over 10 points when adjusted for one-time items last year, including the TippingPoint divestiture gain. And now to cash flow; free cash flow was better than expected at negative $64 million. However, this was artificially high since we accrued approximately $300 million for enterprise services payroll ending March 31 that was paid by DXC and we expect to repay that in the second half. The cash conversion cycle now reflects the removal of enterprise services and was negative 12 days down one day sequentially. Turning to capital allocation, during the quarter we paid $107 million in dividend payments and repurchased $670 million of outstanding shares. We've now returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the first-half of fiscal year '17, aligned to our $3 billion full year commitment. Moving to our two spin merge transactions, we completed our ES CSC spin merge transactions on April 1 on schedule and on budget. The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on September 1. We are making progress removing stranded costs and continue to anticipate a $0.06 diluted EPS impact in fiscal year '17 with all costs eliminated on a run rate basis by the end of the year. Turning to our outlook, the seasonality of EPS will be more backend loaded given the stranded costs and M&A dilution will be worked down over time. Also, the majority of the $200 million to $300 million of incremental cost savings will come in Q4. Also keep in mind that our outlook reflects the company as it stands today, with a partial year contributions from ES and a full year contributions from software, since we haven't yet closed that transaction. As is our typical practice, we will update our outlook when we close the software transaction. With that we expect Q3 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.28. From a GAAP perspective, we expect Q3 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.02 to positive $0.02. For the full-year, we are holding to our prior fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook of $1.46 to $1.56. From a GAAP perspective, we expect fiscal year '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of negative $0.03 to $0.07. Finally, turning to cash flow outlook, as previously mentioned, we anticipate paying DXC approximately $300 million in the second half for the ES payroll ending March 31. Also, we expect to pay DXC an incremental $300 million in the second half for agreed-upon balance sheet adjustments, primarily related to working capital. This incremental payment will not reduce our overall cash balances as our ES pension funding requirements were less than expected by roughly the same amount. In total, we continue to expect full year fiscal year '17 free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion. Overall while this quarter presented some challenges, like Meg, I'm confident that our plan is the right long-term strategy to position the future HPE for success. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Thank you. If we look at the midpoint of your 3Q guidance and the midpoint of your full-year guidance, it suggests an EPS for 4Q of somewhere around $0.45 which is a pretty significant acceleration versus the 3Q guidance. Can you give a little bit of detail on how you get to that number? Is that primarily the cost cutting that you're seeing and some of that accelerated cost that you can take out or maybe give us a little detail on why you're confident you can hit that number? Tim Stonesifer : Sure Sherri. So first of all, just to remind everybody, the full-year guide includes a partial year for ES and a full year for software. So, it may be easiest to start with Q2. So Q2 we ended up with an EPS of $0.35, now $0.10 of that was related to ES, which was in discontinued operations. So, when you move from Q2 to Q3, that's relatively flat and basically what you're seeing there is the impact and the pressure from the stranded costs, from the short-term dilution of the acquisitions and some of the commodity cost pressures. Those are being offset by the second-half cost actions okay. And then to your point, when you go from through 3Q to 4Q, you'd see that would imply about a $0.19 improvement quarter-over-quarter and there is really three elements to that. The first one is just typical seasonality. So, if you were to go look at last year's results, we saw a similar uplift in Q3 to Q4. Same thing in 2015, we would anticipate that same type of lift due to seasonality in Q4 of this year. If you just think about the software business as an example, Q4 is typically much higher than Q3. The second component of it is as we eliminate the stranded costs and as we get right size the cost envelopes around the acquisitions, that will be favorable in Q4 and then thirdly, is a $200 million to $300 million of cost out. So, the way I would think about that is roughly a third of that will come in Q3 and then two thirds of that will come in Q4 and that's what's going to drive the remainder of the lift. So that's why you see that ramp up in Q4. Sherri Scribner : Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful and then looking at the operating margin in EG, it's a little disappointing. Can you give us a little more detail on which segment that came from? Is it related to the weakness in the server market? I would assume it would not be that much related to servers given that a lot of that is tier 1 which doesn't have a lot of margin. So, is it more a result of the weakness in the storage market? Thank you. Tim Stonesifer : Yeah. We don't really give BU specific guidance on the margins, but yeah, I would say servers is driving a component of that and again the way I think about it as we talked about in the prepared remarks is there's a component of that that's structural. There's a component of that that's one-time cost and then you have the operational headwinds, which is primarily the commodities cost increases. Again, most of that is memory. So that has a heavy impact on the server margin. Meg Whitman : I think the other thing I would add to that is we believe that the worst is over from a margin pressure perspective in Q2 and we expect year-ago levels by Q4 as the structured -- the structural challenges that Tim mentioned roll-off as does the one-time acquisition dilution that goes away. So, what you're left with is the more normal business challenges that we all have where it's commodity price increases or whatever and then of course obviously the $200 million to $300 million of cost reduction also helps the margin. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have -- go to the next question please? Operator : Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. I wanted to revisit that operating margin question. My understanding from the conference call last quarter was that you expected the enterprise group to be pretty similar in Q2 to Q1 both from a revenue and from a profitability perspective and there was a dramatic downturn in profitability sequentially 390 basis points. And I understood your bridge Tim, but many of the things you noted like H3C divestiture you had in Q1 or the acquisition impact you had most of that in Q1 the stranded costs I think were very visible to you. And so, I guess my question is was this simply incremental competition that didn't allow you to raise prices in the way that you thought or what changed and as I think about like a reality check if TS is 30% your business in EG and has 30% margins, that means everything else is zero profitability today, pre-overhead allocations and with overhead allocations, it's negative and how do we reconcile such dramatically weak levels of profitability? Tim Stonesifer : Okay. I think there are a few questions in there. So, let me see what I can do. So, I think to your point, we did on the Q1 call, we did think that revenues would stabilize. We did not say that margins would stabilize and again if you're going through a quarter-over-quarter walk, to your point, stranded cost is a big element of that. We did not see that in Q1 obviously because we just separated the ES business in March. So, all the overhead that we were allocating to ES in Q1, a lot of that was being allocated to EG. There is some FX impact. Again, we were hedged from an FX perspective in Q1 from the prior hedges that we put on in Q4. So, there was some pressure driven by that. There was also some dilution in the acquisitions which we really didn't -- we didn't talk about in Q1, nor did we have that pressure. That gave us some pressure from an overall margin perspective. DRAM is causing a pressure point. We did know about that in Q1. To your point, we talked about that. Obviously, that's why we took our guide down, but if you look at memory costs in 2Q, they're actually up another 10%. So, we saw a big increase in Q1 that was when we got the 40% and 50% lift, but those have continued to go up in Q2. So that drives some incremental pressure. And then from a pricing point, we did go out with global price increases, but to be honest with you, the results were mixed. We saw some traction in APJ and those came in in line with what we thought they would. When you look at the Americas, we did not gain as much traction as we had anticipated, particularly in the U.S. and that's driven by some very difficult competitive behaviors and challenges. We saw those same types of competitive dynamics in EMEA as well. So, the overall pricing mitigation that we had talked about I'd say came in lighter than we had expected. And then lastly you have typical seasonality from Q2 to Q1 or from Q1 to Q2. So that's driving a lot of the variation from quarter to quarter. Now to get to your question on product margins, yes if you look at TS, the good news with TS is it's been very stable over the years not only from a revenue perspective but also for a margin perspective. So, we expect that stabilization to continue as we go forward. Given the pressures that I just walked through between stranded costs, short-term dilution, DRAM pricing, yes, margins were pressured in Q2 and product margins would be negative. Now as I think about how do we progress going forward and to Meg's point earlier, we think 2Q is going to be a low point and basically that's driven by the fact that one, we're going to work out the stranded costs. Again, those will be that zero on a run rate basis. By the time we exit Q4, we will have time to right size the cost envelopes to the appropriate levels on the Nimble and SimpliVity acquisitions and then lastly, we've got the $200 million to $300 million of cost that we've targeted to come out in the second half. Again, I think a third of that will come out in Q3 and two thirds of that will come out in Q4. So, as we take those cost out and the other thing that we should get is we should get a mix lift. As we continue to grow the higher margin businesses, HPC up 20% organically, all-flash array up 33%, Aruba up 27%. Obviously, those parts of the portfolio carry a higher margin. So, we should get a margin lift going forward. So hopefully that gives you a little bit more color. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. In the press release as well as the prepared remarks, you mentioned several times the excluding the tier 1 server sales, can you just help us understand strategically is that just you guys at Hewlett Packard Enterprise have strategically decided to shift away from that? Is it permanent share loss, timing, absorption. Is this something we should expect to have you call out many times in the future quarters to come or one-time in nature because last quarter it came up and now hear it again? How should we just think about this huge issue of excluding tier 1 server sales, thank you? Meg Whitman : Yeah, so tier 1 service provider is a segment that we entered I think maybe 18 months ago, two years ago and we are heavily dependent on one customer. So, we're doing a couple of things. We anticipate that one customer to continue to - purchases to decline and so this tier 1 rationale or the way we talk about is going to continue for the next couple of quarters because it's a pretty big number. We're doing a couple things, one is we're really thinking hard about what the future strategy is for tier 1. We continue to get new tier 1 customers, but this is low calorie business actually and so we need to think through does it make sense to continue that business on a go-forward basis or are we better off actually putting our selling resources and our R&D resources against more margin-rich sustainable profitability. But the answer is yes, there will be I think for another at least a couple of quarters, there will be the explanation of what does our server business look like ex tier 1, which we think is a better -- gives you all a better understanding of what's happening with that one customer and then what's happening with the rest of the core industry-standard server business. Jim Suva : Are there other tier 1 server customers besides that one that we should think about? Meg Whitman : It's the vast majority is with one, there is a few others and we're building out some more tier 1 customers, but fundamentally the strategic question is, is this a business we really want to be in because we're not in the business for share, for share's sake. We're in it to get a return on our investment dollars and right now that doesn't look like a particularly productive segment for us. Jim Suva : Thanks for the details, much appreciated. Andy Simanek : Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. I appreciate that in the original guidance, but have you contemplated the ideal of removing $200 million to $300 million post the ES transaction or is that incremental work to offset the memory cost that surprised you this year and then just as a follow-on to that. How should we think about incremental cost takeout as we -- how did the next year post the software divestiture is that $200 million to $300 million run rate or more like $400 million tto $600 million for the full-year the right run rate to think about for next year? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure Katy. So, I'll answer the first piece and then Meg you can jump in here. From a cost perspective, the $200 million to $300 million is incremental and it is all in the second half. So, as you know, we're always looking at cost. Now we're trying to be and we continue to be very sensitive to protecting our R&D, protecting our sales costs. But net-net, particularly given the spinoff and now the fact that we have 110,000 fewer people and we've had a little bit of time under our belt to operate in the new model if you will, we do think there are opportunities and there are going to be opportunities in the usual suspects. So, if you think about just tighter spending around travel, around optimizing programs spend, around tighter policy enforcement, we think there's more work to do there and we can continue to do that, but there's also an opportunity to simplify. So, if you think about now as a standalone or as a remain co. if you will, you have the global structural versus the regional, versus the country. You have spanning control, you have all those types of things. Those are the things that we're having better line of sight on and that's some of the cost that we will address in the second half the year and Meg do you have anything else to put on it? Meg Whitman : Yeah, I think Katy, if you cast all the way back up, we have just gone through one of the largest transformations may be in American business history. We've created four industry-leading companies that I think are poised to do very well in their given segments and so now we are very focused on the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise financial architecture. And I think there's a couple things Tim said it well, we now need to look at that cost structure and say what is the process reengineering we need to do? What are some of the policy decisions we need to make upstream to be a much more efficient, leaner company that we can really see the productivity benefits and Tim mentioned simplification. There's lots we can do here. So, I am -- we are now in a different stage. I can see this very clearly now that ES is gone, software is on its way and of course HPI has been on its own for 18 months. So, we're at that next stage that I think we can have a major impact in how we run this company more efficiently and leanly. So were super excited about it. It's going to be a lot of work because whenever you restructure a company, it's a lot of work, but I can see it very clearly. Now I want to say one thing is that we will not be adding to the restructuring dollars that we had already laid out for you. So, remember there are $700 million of restructuring in cash payment in this year, another $200 million in '18. We may pull that $200 million in depending we're still working on that, but any incremental cost savings will be funded through the P&L. There will be no more restructuring dollars, which I think is an important point to make because I remember many of you especially when we owned ES and said this is sort of the perennial restructuring that actually is not going to be the case going forward. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Maynard Um : Hi thanks. On the server business, can you just help us with the expectations over the next couple quarters. You'll have SimpliVity for another full quarter, you'll have synergy ramping and the alliances look like they're growing. Do you think that gets you back to flattish type growth in Q3 and Q4 and then I have a follow-up? Tim Stonesifer : Sure. As synergy comes online, as we continue to grow particularly if you think about high-performance compute and some of the areas of the portfolio, again excluding tier 1, from a year-over-year component, we would expect to return back to growth in the latter part of the year. Maynard Um : Great. And then on the storage side, how long do you think it will take to fully integrated the Nimble storage to be ready from a go-to-market and channel perspective and when do you think we start to see the ramp in storage from Nimble, thanks? Meg Whitman : So, we're working hard to integrate Nimble into our data center storage sales teams. SimpliVity is all the way in both from an R&D perspective and as a sales perspective. Nimble R&D is going to merge with three par R&D to be a more powerful storage R&D team. And then we're just about now ramping Nimble into our data center storage business. What's interesting about Nimble is there are some markets where Nimble actually had quite a good position. There are some markets where Nimble is not at all. So, we're actually building from scratch in a number of those markets, which is great actually. But I'd say certainly by the end of this quarter, Nimble will be firmly integrated into our go-to-market motion and I think you'll start to see the ramp. Interestingly, what we saw with Aruba, what we saw with SimpliVity and what we believe we will see with Nimble is actually being part of the HP family helps accelerate those wins. There's many customers who said, we would not have considered Nimble as a standalone independent company without being part of HPE. Actually, I think Aruba would tell you the same thing. We're winning deals there because they're part of the family. SimpliVity, we're winning deals there because they recognize that it actually holds into our overall offering and you're not purchasing an island. In other words, a completely new technology that's unconnected to the rest of your data center. There is actually it's part of the family of HPE infrastructure. So that's worked really well for us and I think you're going to see Nimble ramp through the end of the year nicely. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Maynard. Can we -- let's go the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Can you talk a bit about your cash usage strategy? Obviously, you made several acquisitions over the last few quarters and you've had cash come in from both sometimes operating cash flow as well as what you've got from the divestitures. So how are you thinking about cash as you sort of normalize it out? Has there been any change and how are you thinking about acquisitions given all the ones that you have that you're now integrating and then I have a follow-up? Thank you. Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So, I'll give it a shot and Meg you can jump in here. So again, I think our strategy is still the same. We are going to continue to focus on organic investments because where we do that well and we do it right, it's good for customers, it's good for shareholders, it's good for partners, it's good for employees. We always continue to look at share buybacks. Obviously, we're bias toward share buybacks right now. And then we're going to continue to look at M&A as long as it fulfills gaps in our strategy. So, the way we think about M&A again as being very consistent and it's all around complementary IP, where we can leverage our distribution and drive profitable growth. So, it's all returns based. That a framework that's worked well for us in the last 12 to 18 months and I would expect us to continue to operate within that framework going forward. Meg Whitman : No. I don't have much to add to that. The only think I would say is as we think about innovation, as Tim said, our first choice is organic innovation, think synergy. We will also look at innovation coming from M&A, but as Tim said, it's return based. We have to buy it right. It has to be complementary technology that can leverage our distribution channels and then the third area is actually our Pathfinder program where we make small investments in new generation companies that we're not to be a venture capital company. I'm not looking for venture returns there. I'm looking for companies that further our strategy powering hybrid IT, powering the intelligent edge and the services that we can weave into our solution. So, for example Docker, Mesosphere, Chef are all woven now into HPE one view. That makes HPE one view much more valuable to our customers, actually creates beginnings of a new stack as a control plane for hybrid IT and is actually good for those small companies and doesn't require us to outlay $300 billion, $500 billion, $600 billion for relatively unproven technology. So that's the way we think of it and it's been a cultural change for the company because we're used to selling only what we own, but actually this Pathfinder programs has been great success. I think it's a differentiator for Hewlett Packard Enterprise because in some ways what we do is we curate Silicon Valley for our enterprise customers. Shannon Cross : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then my second question is just as we think about Remain Co given all of the moving parts, then you talked about EPS ranges in the past and that, is there any shifting around given the accelerated restructuring versus maybe the pressure from component or from a server standpoint that we should take into account as we look forward past '17? Tim Stonesifer : So, if you look at Remain Co. and again I'll take you back to Sam, we guided a $1.25 to $1.35 from an EPS perspective and we had normalized free cash flow of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. Now obviously we took that number down or we took our number down in total by $0.12 that was in Q1 that was driven by some of the FX pressures we saw, some of the commodity cost pressures we saw as well some execution issues that we were working through. So, as I look at those three categories, those were all primarily EG related. So, I would adjust the $1.25 to $1.35 by that $0.12 and then I would also adjust your $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion of normalized free cash flow. I would take that down to roughly $2 billion of normalized free cash flow to reflect the earnings pressure. So that will give you sort of a baseline as we exit '17 of about $1.13 to $1.23 and I think there are two or three areas that are going to impact that you need to think about as we move forward. The first one is commodity cost movements and the corresponding pricing mitigation. Again, as we talked about earlier we are making traction in that we anticipate an APJ, but we're finding it very difficult in the Americas and EMEA. So, depending on how that equation plays out, that would have an impact on your baseline. From the second-half cost actions, the $200 million to $300 million that we talked about, to the extent that a piece of that is recurring, which we would expect, that would also impact your baseline going forward and then when you look at the rightsizing, the cost envelopes particularly around the acquisitions, that should provide a little bit of accretion going forward. So that's how I would think about the baseline for Remain Co. from both a cash and EPS perspective and we will give much more guidance and clarity and visibility at SAM in October. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you Andy Simanek : Perfect. Thank you, Shannon. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Thank you very much. Regarding the storage business, first of all, I didn't see the converged traditional breakout? Are you still giving that and you did say that you're supply constrained in the quarter on storage and that that would continue, is that correct? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure. So, from a converged perspective, I think the converged part of the portfolio was down roughly 8% and traditional was down roughly 20% and then from a material perspective, really the supply constraints are much more around SSD and again as that market is very tight right now, we're getting our fair share of supplies, but given the complexity of our broad product portfolio, we're finding it challenging to what we call demand shift. But we would expect that to loosen up in the second half of the year particularly as 3D yields improve as well as more factories come online. So that should loosen up in the second half of the year. Steve Milunovich : Okay. And then Meg internally last quarter you talked about execution issues, could you bring us up date in terms of if those are alleviated and externally, what are you hearing from your customers in terms of the split? I've heard a few customers wonder if you may be pruned too far relative to having full solutions capability. Meg Whitman : Yes, so let me talk a little bit about the execution issues. I would say we have largely overcome most of the execution issues that we discussed in Q1 and the biggest hurdle was getting through the ES separation that in many ways was far more complex than the HPE HPI separation because we had to spin and then merge into a third-party. So, a third party actually had to be managed and worked with here. So, the first time it was separating the siblings, now we had to merge with the cousin. I would say -- and by the way that took a chunk of our leadership time in every country around workforce councils and things like that. The other thing that we talked about last time was we had three new heads of all of our regions plus a new head of worldwide sales and that as I said last time might've been a little bit too much change at once, but now I'm firmly convinced we got the right people in the right job. They've now been in place six months and you're starting to see their impact. For example, the server business in the US ex tier 1, actually had a pretty good quarter and that's thanks to Jim Merritt and his team. So, I feel like execution-wise we're back on track and I think you saw that in terms of the growth areas that we talked about on the call. The feedback from customers that I'm getting is actually they are amazed at how smoothly the separation of these companies has gone, whether it was HPI or CSC. I think if customers are saying have we shrunk back too far, we still need to educate them about the services capability that we still have at HPE and it's not only our TS business, our services and support business, it's our TS consulting business, it's Aruba Services and that's very important, that advice and transform capability I think we need to do a better job of if you will advertising that. But customers who know us well, I think are super excited about the focus. They know the services capability that we have. They really resonated to the strategy. This strategy of we make hybrid IT simple, we power the intelligent edge and we have the services to make it happen totally resonate and so we're excited about that. So, I have no doubt about the strategy. I have no doubt about the validity of the spins. We are going to end up as a much stronger set of companies than we would have before and I think you all recognize the value creation for shareholders that has occurred here. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Steve. I think we have time for one last question please? Operator : And our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Tim, you mentioned bulk tightening on travel, other discretionary spend items that sound obviously transitory in nature. How much of that $200 million, 300 million of incremental cost saves would you view as transitory versus elements that could be more structural like the span of control initiatives. And my follow-up Meg just to clarify, did you say that the worst of the pricing environment in servers is behind you and if yes what do you think that's the case? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, I actually said that I thought the margin pressure was the worse that we're going to see in Q2 and it should return to last year's level by Q4 and I can't say necessarily that the pricing is going to alleviate but we've got the $200 million to $300 million of cost structure we've got both structural things and we've got obviously the one timer like stranded costs and acquisition dilution. So that's why I say it's going to come back to last year's level by Q4. Tim Stonesifer : And then from a cost structure perspective ballpark, I think roughly half of that $200 million to $300 million is more of the discretionary type stuff like policies, like travel and then the other half is labor related and within that labor piece, I'd break it out into two components. I think half of that is really around lowering our rehire rates, taking a look at contractor. So, when you think about the cost to do those things, there really is no cost to do that and then there's the remaining 25% that would be more structural and that's why we're evaluating the restructuring that we have in 2018 employing forward. Meg Whitman : Yes, I would say the other thing I would add here is I think of that $200 million to $300 million as a down payment on the cost structure and reengineering that we need to do on the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise. As I said to the answer to one of the earlier questions, I am now laser-like focused on what is the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise financial architecture? How do we simplify? How we reengineer the processes and how we take out overhead given that we are now a $28 billion company down from $110 billion company just five years ago. So, I have a much clearer view of how this company needs to be re-architected from a financial perspective and reengineered from a process and complexity standpoint. So, I'd say listen, the way I think about that is the down payment on what we could do in 2018 and beyond. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Wamsi. I think with that we can wrap up today's call, thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you and you may disconnect your lines.",

My name is Austin, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andy Simanek : Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fiscal 2017 third quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HPE\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2017. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and beginning with fiscal year 2016 are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details. With that, let me turn it over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. Today I would like to cover a couple of things. First, I\u2019ll review the results for the quarter, then I\u2019d like to talk about what we see ahead, how we are redesigning this company to be fit for purpose and how we are driving the innovation needed to win in the market. So let\u2019s dive right in. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q3 performance. We saw strong momentum across key segments of the portfolio. Execution continued to improve and our profitability increased over last quarter as we reduced costs across the organization and we successfully closed the spin merge of our software business late last week. With that milestone behind us, we are off and running.  In Q3, we delivered total revenue of $8.2 billion which includes a final full quarter of revenue contribution from software. Future HPE, which now consists of Enterprise Group and Financial Services was $7.5 billion, up 6% year-over-year and if you remove tier-1 revenue was up 10%. From a profitability perspective, we made good progress on improving our operating margins as we began executing the cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter.  Tim will provide more detail, but our EG margin improved sequentially to 9.3% as we work to mitigate increased commodity prices, stranded costs from divestitures and dilution from acquisitions. We expect to see even greater improvement next quarter. With the strong revenue performance and improved profitability we were able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.30 above our previously provided outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 per share. Free cash flow was also strong at over $400 million in the quarter putting us in a good position to achieve our full year outlook. Turning to the business performance, while we have seen some improvement in the market overall, our strong Q3 performance was driven primarily by better execution and a compelling portfolio resulting in solid growth across key businesses. For example, core server revenue was up 13% year-over-year and we expect to gain share in calendar Q2. Since its launch, late last year, Synergy is experiencing very strong momentum with over 600 customers to-date. As a side benefit we are also seeing an uptick in blade sales as customers move on to the path to become Synergy ready. We are also experiencing continued strength in High Performance Compute with our combined HPE and SGI portfolio. And early this summer we launched the first fully integrated HPE SimpliVity hyper converged offering. Hyper converged is core to our strategy of making hybrid IT simple for our customers and we saw over 200% growth in Q3 although off a small base. All-Flash storage grew 30% year-over-year driven by Nimble, which exceeded both revenue and profit plans for the quarter. With Nimble and our marketing-leading 3PAR portfolio, HPE delivers a full range of superior flash storage solutions for customers across every segment. We are already seeing the benefits of the combination of Nimble and HPE and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about the potential. Aruba continues to perform exceptionally well. Wireless LAN solutions grew over 30% in the quarter and Aruba won approximately 70 new logos. Aruba continues to take share from competitors like CISCO by introducing truly breakthrough solutions for the intelligent edge. For example, in June, Aruba announced a fundamentally new core aggregation switch called Aruba 8400.  This differentiated solution has a completely redesigned operating system to support the new requirements of modern networks. It enables simplified operations for the network operator, a more powerful and scalable core to support the influx of data, faster time to remediate issues and granular visibility into what\u2019s in the network.  We estimate the market for this technology is nearly $4 billion and technology services which includes Pointnext continued to perform well with Q3 revenue up 2% over last year. We\u2019ve now seen five consecutive quarters of order and revenue growth in consulting as we put more emphasis on advisory and transformed services post the ES split. To further strengthen our consulting capabilities, just this morning we announced our intent to acquire Cloud Technology Partners, a leading cloud consulting company that helps its Fortune 500 customers move to a cloud, build new cloud-based solutions and manage their cloud environment. CTP\u2019s consulting, design and operational advisory services for cloud environments will strengthen our hybrid IT consulting expertise in a fast-growing market. As I mentioned earlier, while executing our business plan for the quarter, we also completed a major milestone. On Friday, we officially closed the spin-off and merger of our software business with Micro Focus on time and below budget. This deal delivered approximately $9 billion in value and I am confident that this was a great move for the new Micro Focus and for HPE. With that transaction now behind us, we have the right strategy and the right portfolio to succeed in today\u2019s environment. Our strategy is clear, to make hybrid IT simple, to power the intelligent edge and to provide the services to make it all happen. It is based on what customers are asking for today and where we see the market moving.  Now as a smaller organization with fewer lines of business and clear strategic priorities, we have the opportunity to create an internal structure and operating model that is simpler, nimbler and faster. To that end, this quarter we announced a program we are calling HPE Next. The goal of HPE Next is to produce an organization that is precisely built to compete and win in the marketplace. To do so, we are clean sheeting the operating model and organization structure to simplify how we work. We are improving core business processes to clarify accountabilities and make the company more efficient and effective. We are rightsizing the end-to-end cost structure to ensure we deliver on our financial architecture.  All of this will be done with a continued commitment to operational excellence and to our customers. These efforts will simplify everything from how we engage with customers to how we process orders and compensate sales. For example we are reducing the layers in our customer-facing organizations and shifting resources to the geographic markets that will drive the vast majority of our business. These changes will be better for HPE and for our customers. We will have much more detail on this program and the associated financial impact at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. But as discussed on previous calls, we do expect to accelerate most of the $200 million of cash payments originally planned for fiscal year 2018 into Q4 2017 to help quickly enable this program.  Looking forward, we aim to offset a portion of the funding requirements associated with HPE Next through lower than expected separation costs and real estate sales enabled by the spin merge transactions completed this year. For example, we recently sold our Roseville site for approximately $100 million and are now leasing back smaller offices there. Ultimately, HPE Next will produce the long-term operating and financial blueprint for our company with cost discipline built into the system. While we work to create the strong internal structure, we cannot lose sight of innovation. Innovation is our life blood and the investments we make now will drive HPE in the future. Our innovation is at the core of some of the most significant technology trends in the market today like cyber security, internet of things and artificial intelligence. And today, more than ever, we are able to make focused investments in the areas where we see the most opportunity for growth in the future. For example, security has become a board level issue for customers across industries and market segments. In June, we announced the world\u2019s most secured industry standard server. HPE is the only company that embeds proprietary silicon-based security into its industry standard servers.  This approach addresses firmware attacks, which are one of the biggest threats facing enterprises and governments today. We are also integrating the behavioral analytics based security software from our recent acquisition Niara, across Aruba\u2019s networking portfolio. In the internet of things and in particularly the industrial internet of things, we see a tremendous opportunity as customers are looking to transform everything from retail environments to manufacturing floors. Our solutions and services capabilities are allowing customers to connect, monitor and analyze these environments, enable new customer experiences, new revenue streams and reduced cost structures. We are already seeing growth in our Aruba Wireless Connectivity business driven by IOT and we are seeing significant emerging interest in our highly differentiated edge compute business known as Edgeline driven by these same trends. Another example is artificial intelligence, which is transforming industries from retail to manufacturing. We help our customers use AI to simplify operations and drive business outcomes in a number of ways. For example, we are incorporating Nimble\u2019s predictive analytics technology that uses machine learning to predict and resolve performance issues across our storage portfolio. Also our High Performance Compute systems provide the power that is required to crunch the massive amount of data used for AI applications. As the amount of data grows, we have a strong roadmap to memory-driven computing based on our machine research project that will exponentially extend these capabilities in the future.  Finally, there is one commonality our customers have, it\u2019s that they live in a hybrid IT world. They run a mix of workloads in their datacenter as well as private, managed and public clouds. Our top priority is to help them succeed in this environment and that requires a single data management plan across different environments.  At Discover we unveiled our vision for our new hybrid IT stack which brings together our industry-leading one view platform with a new multi-cloud management capability as well as key software assets like Cloud Cruiser to create a truly unique, software-defined approach to hybrid IT management. This new platform will allow customers to simply manage assets across traditional IT, private cloud, managed and public clouds and optimize their right mix of hybrid IT. We already have a number of beta customers and this platform will be widely available by the end of the year. So, overall, I am very pleased with the quarter and we now have achieved most of our significant milestones for the year. While we have more work to do, I continue to be excited about the future of HPE. The markets where we play today offer tremendous opportunity and with laser focus and a world-class portfolio we are positioned to win.  We will have a lot more to tell you at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco. Before I turn it over to Tim, I want to quickly touch on the devastation we are seeing in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey. HPE has been part of the Houston community for decades and our nearly 3400 employees are deeply rooted in that community. The well-being of our employees and their families has been our top concern over the past week and we are providing support to many of them. From a business perspective, we are continuing to assess the impact. But Tim will provide a bit more color on that. I want to thank our amazing team in Houston who has been working around the clock to get our office back up at running, answer customer enquiries and make sure their colleagues have the support they need. So thank you to them. And with that, I will turn it over to Tim. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks Meg. Performance in Q3 was strong with solid revenue growth and sequential operating margin improvement in line with our expectations. We achieved better than expected cost savings from the plan we described last quarter with more improvement expected to come next quarter.  Total revenue for the quarter was $8.2 billion. This includes a full quarter of software which going forward will be accounted for in discontinued operations. Revenue from Future HPE was $7.5 billion, up 6% adjusted for divestitures and currency and up over 10% excluding Tier-1 server sales. I\u2019ll dive into the business segment performance in a minute. From a macro perspective, we are seeing some overall improvement in the market, but continue to see competitive pricing in a challenging commodities environment. Currency remained unfavorable, but to a lesser extent than prior quarters with a 70 basis point year-over-year headwind to revenue in Q3. HPE\u2019s performance in the U.S. excluding Tier-1 improved as core servers returned to growth and networking performance accelerated but storage remain challenged. Revenue in Europe has also returned to growth with strong results in Germany and broad stabilization across Western Europe. Asia Pacific similarly improved with double-digit growth in Japan, China and India.  Turning to margins, gross margin of 33% was down 340 basis points year-over-year and down 80 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.4% was down 150 basis points year-over-year but up 60 basis points sequentially.  As mentioned, we are seeing the initial results of our second half cost savings plan with sequential improvement in EG margins. However, we continue to be negatively impacted by a challenging pricing environment, commodities costs, and to a lesser extent currency. We also had a full quarter impact from strategy costs and short-term dilution from recent acquisitions but we are making good progress and still expect both to be eliminated by year end. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.30 is above our previous outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 primarily due to cost savings, software performance and favorable other income and expense. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes pretax amounts for our separation charges of $190 million, restructuring charges of $165 million, and amortization of intangible assets of $132 million. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.10 above our previously provided outlook range of negative $0.02 to $0.02 primarily due to an enterprise services spin merger-related non-cash income tax benefit.  Now turning to the results by business. In the Enterprise Group, revenue was up 3% as the go to market changes we made at the beginning of the year combined with recent product rollouts more than offset pressure from a competitive market. EG revenue grew over 9% year-over-year excluding tier-1 server sales with strong growth in ISS Core, Aruba, and All-Flash storage. Operating margins were down 350 basis points year-over-year. However they improved 50 basis points sequentially to 9.3%. The sequential margin improvement is in line with the cost savings plan we outlined on the Q2 earnings call, which call for savings of $200 million to $300 million in the second half of the year. Server revenue was flat and grew 12% excluding tier-1, thanks to better execution, easier comparison of the prior year and some improvement in the overall market. We also have strong portfolio in the growing and more profitable areas of the market. High Performance Compute grew more than 40% with SGI and over 10% organically. And synergies momentum is generating strong pull through for blades that were up double-digits.  We are also seeing good traction in hyper converge that grew triple digits. Storage revenue was up 11% driven by the Nimble acquisition, offset by continued challenging markets. All-Flash arrays grew 30% year-over-year primarily driven by the Nimble acquisition, which is performing ahead of expectations. We continue to expect NAND supply constraints through the end of the year but they have started to moderate.  3PAR revenue declined 9% due to a more competitive market in the U.S. Networking revenue grew 16% driven by Aruba Wireless Solutions which grew over 30%. We are also seeing Aruba lead to strong pull through of wired switching that grew mid single-digits demonstrating the combined strength of Aruba and HPE. Networking is now seeing growth across all product groups and geographies. Technology services grew revenue for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 2% year-over-year.  While overall orders were down slightly, we continue to improve service intensity or attach dollars per unit which help offset pressure from declining hardware unit sales. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 10%, its fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth driven by lease conversions and an increase in operating lease mix. Financing volume however declined 8% due to lower indirect business. Operating profit declined 210 basis points year-over-year to 7.8% reflecting one-time items and the increased operating lease mix. We continue to see the strategic importance of financial services to our customers as flexible consumption pricing models gain momentum. Software revenue was down 1% as growth in licenses and SaaS was offset by declines in professional services with more emphasis on higher margin products. The operating margin was 24.9%, a 710 basis point improvement year-over-year.  Looking back at the quarter, I am pleased with the business performance and believe we have a strong portfolio of solutions and services that\u2019s clearly gaining traction with customers. Increasingly, we are seeing customers turn to us for a comprehensive IT strategy from hybrid IT to the campus to services. For example, last month, we announced a new project with NASA focused on developing a supercomputer that can withstand the harsh conditions of space.  We also recently announced that HPE has been selected as the official IT networking and wireless infrastructure partner for the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club\u2019s new state-of-the-art stadium being built in London. And Point Next continues to add logos from around the world including Siemens, Travelers and Saudi Telecom Company in Q3. Overall, we feel good about the momentum we are seeing and the opportunity ahead.  Now to cash flow. Free cash flow was better than expected at $428 million benefiting from continued improvement and working capital management and favorable CapEx. The cash conversion cycle was down five days sequentially to negative 17 days. Capital allocation during the quarter included $107 million in dividend payments and $625 million of share repurchases.  We\u2019ve now returned $2.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date and are on track to fulfill our full year commitment of $3 billion.  Moving to our software spin merge transaction, we completed the software spin on September 1 on schedule and under budget. We continue to make progress moving stranded costs and remain confident will eliminate all costs on a run rate basis by the end of the fiscal year.  Turning to our outlook, as the software transaction is now complete, consistent with prior divestitures, the fiscal 2017 earnings outlook will no longer include software for the last two months of the year. As a reminder, the impact of removing two months of software from the full year fiscal year 2017 earnings outlook is $0.13 including $0.12 of earnings contribution and $0.01 of stranded costs. With that, we expect to finish fiscal year 2017 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.40. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be negative $0.11 to negative $0.07. Please note that our outlook does not include a likely material, non-cash tax benefit associated with potential corporate tax reform. We expect to undertake tax planning actions next quarter and are still working through the details, but we expect them to result in a material benefit to our Q4 2017 and fiscal 2017 tax rate.  Also, as Meg mentioned, Hurricane Harvey has had a substantial impact to our Houston operations. Our top priority has been ensuring the well-being of our employees during this challenging time. From a business perspective, we are continuing to assess the impact. Fortunately, we have a limited amount of production in Houston which we\u2019ve been able mostly shift to other locations. So we don\u2019t expect the disruption to our customer deliveries.  Of course, we will bear uninsured cost associated with lost inventory or repairs to our campus, but have not incorporated anything into our outlook at this time.  Finally, turning to the cash flow outlook. Year-to-date free cash flow was almost equal to our full year target. However, Q4 cash flow will likely be lower than in prior years due to less seasonal earnings uplift following the software and ES divestitures and the additional restructuring charges were accelerating from fiscal year 2018.  As a result, we are maintaining our full year fiscal year 2017 free cash flow outlook of negative $1.8 billion, but do acknowledge there could be some upside. Additionally, we\u2019ll need to make payments for previously agreed upon balance sheet adjustments to DXE and Micro Focus that are still being finalized but still expect to end the year with an operating company net cash balance of approximately $6.5 billion. Before we turn to questions, I wanted to briefly address a few topics which may provide helpful context going into our October 18th Analyst Day. First, we gave a view of fiscal year 2017 Future HPE earnings during our last Analyst Day of $1.25 to $1.35. However this did not account for $0.06 of stranded costs and the first quarter earnings takedown for currency and DRAM pricing of $0.12. Those two items will bring the fiscal year 2017 outlook midpoint down to $1.12. We\u2019ve also seen further commodity pressure, a more competitive pricing environment and some dilution from M&A that reduced of fiscal year 2017 outlook for Future HPE closer to just over $1.  Second, we are in the process of settling outstanding tax disputes that have already been reserved against but will result in approximately $300 million of cash payments in fiscal year 2018 that we think can be partially recovered through foreign tax credits and future years.  And lastly, with regard to the HPE Next program Meg discussed, I want to provide some additional color on high level expected savings before we provide the full details at our Analyst Day. Based on our current assessment, we are committed to $1.5 billion of gross savings over the next three years. Keep in mind that this is a gross savings number and the net savings could be impacted by incremental investments, ongoing commodity pressure and a continued competitive pricing environment. We are still working out the funding requirements for HPE Next, but we expect to partially offset any cash cost with real estate sales including the Roseville site completed this quarter and lower than expected separation costs. While we\u2019ll provide more details about the HPE Next initiative at our upcoming Analyst Day, it\u2019s absolutely the right thing to do and we\u2019ll achieve a very attractive return on the required investment. Overall, like Meg, I am very pleased with the progress made this quarter and I am confident that our plan is the right long-term strategy to position us for success. I look forward to discussing the future of HPE at our upcoming Analyst Day.  Now let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to start with a clarification, Tim and make sure I understand your commentary around fiscal 2017 [indiscernible] earnings. So the way I read it is $1 of earnings in fiscal 2017. If you back out software and services, and so we should think about growing off of that base by some amount in fiscal 2018, is that right? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, that\u2019s correct. I mean, if you take into account the stranded cost, the $0.12 take down, obviously we have some short-term dilution that we\u2019ve been talking about these recent acquisitions and then we continue to see commodity pressure in a very competitive pricing environment, the combination of those four things takes it down to about $1 by the end of the year. Katy Huberty : Okay, great. And then, just a question as well, how much of the $200 million to $300 million of savings were you able to capture in the third quarter? And on the same lines, have you been able to pass through some of the higher component costs in the third quarter versus what you saw in the second quarter? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, let me start with the $200 million to $300 million, so last quarter, when we announced that we thought roughly a third of that would happen in Q3 and two-thirds of that would happen in Q4. I just say we are tracking ahead of schedule. I mean, when I look at all the metrics, whether it be travel as an example is down 21%, if I look at contractor headcount, down 14%, rehire rates so how many jobs we fill, which is typically something very difficult for our leadership team to do because obviously there is a lot of work that needs to be done, that\u2019s roughly half of what it was last year. So, we are seeing very good progress there. Like I said, I\u2019d say more than a third is hitting in Q3 and we are confident that we\u2019ll get the rest in Q4.  As far as the pricing components, we still see a very competitive environment out there, particularly in the U.S. So that is something we are not passing though as much as we like. Again, longer term, we think that we\u2019ll be able to pass this pricing, the commodity cost pressure through, because as an industry, I think folks are going to need to make money. But we are not gaining the traction that we had anticipated and that\u2019s why you are seeing the pressure. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Andy Simanek : Great, thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I have a question and a follow-up. I think your guidance for fiscal Q4 implies enterprise group operating margins at around 11%. I think at Discover, Meg you had commented on EG margins rebounding to similar levels as last year or 12% or 13%. Has your outlook for the recovery in Q4 changed over the last three months? And can you help address that apparent disparity? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, sure, I mean, first of all, let me start with Q3 and we were pleased to see that margins were up 50 basis points sequentially. Again, a lot of that was driven by the cost savings that we had laid out on the 2Q call offsetting the pressure that we\u2019re sitting from a full quarter of stranded cost as an example in ES along with the short-term dilution. So, as I look into Q4, I would expect those margins to improve. As we get more cost savings in Q4, as compared to Q3 although not as much as we had expected that\u2019s certainly going to be helpful from a margin perspective.  As you will know, Toni, if you just look at seasonality in EG if you look at the last couple of years, we do see a - fourth quarter is our most profitable quarter. So we should expect to see that same type of lift in Q4 of this year and again as we continue to eliminate the stranded costs and the short-term dilution as we right-size the cost envelopes of those acquisitions that will drive some margin improvement as well.  But, to your question, I would expect to see those margins at the end of Q4 to be closer to 11% and the primary reason is we continue to see commodity cost pressure. I mean, if you just look at memory as an example, we are still up another 5% or 10% versus last quarter. And again, we are not getting the pricing traction that we had anticipated and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing the incremental pressure. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Meg Whitman : And adding to that Toni, I think we can return to historic levels in 2018 but we are going to be probably a quarter or so delayed and we\u2019ll see what happens in commodity pricing and those other things, but I also think HPE Next will certainly help. Toni Sacconaghi : And then, just to follow-up, Meg, I was wondering if you could maybe clear the air on your commitment to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. There is obviously a lot of press, speculation about you are potentially accepting a role at Uber as CEO you had made statements saying that you are remaining at HPE. I was wondering if you could just clear the air on the apparent reporting discrepancies in your statements and where do you stand in terms of your commitment to HPE? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, sure. There has been some press. So, listen, I thought, I was called in very late in the Uber search and I thought it was a very interesting business model to me. It\u2019s actually quite similar to Ebay in many ways. It\u2019s very disruptive, that relies on a community of drivers just like Ebay relies on a community of sellers and the growth prospects reminded me of Ebay in its early days and as you know, I am also an investor in Uber and \u2013 but, in the end that wasn\u2019t the right thing.  And but I would say, that has really nothing to do with HPE which is quite special in its own right and we have a very focused strategy and a path forward to build a very big business on what I think is a quite compelling strategy, hybrid IT, edge computing, IOT and much more. And we also have a remarkable customer base and partner base.  So, the other thing is I have dedicated the last six years of my life to this company and there is more work to do and I am here to help make this company successful and I am excited about the new strategy. So, lots more work to do and I actually am not going anywhere. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question please? Operator : And our next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thank you. I am sure you will talk about this at the Analyst Day, but when we think about potential fiscal 2018 earnings through the business now, clearly we\u2019ve got somewhere around $1 in earnings this year for the remaining business. And when we think about things like stranded costs and higher commodity costs it seems like those things probably should abate to some extent next year.  So I guess, I am trying to understand how much of that are you expecting to abate, I think Meg just said, DRAM and commodity cost probably improve in fiscal 2018 but maybe it takes a quarter longer. Stranded costs should go away, should we be able to add at least some of that to that dollar number in fiscal 2018? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, fair question and we will certainly give you plenty of detail and the security analysts meeting. But just to help you frame it up, we should see some significant uplift from an EPS perspective in 2018 and let me just start with the tailwinds that we should see. So to your point, stranded costs and also the short-term dilution from those, the recent M&A deals that should come back and provide some tailwind for us in 2018 and you guys can quantify that based off of the color we have given.  The other thing that we should see some headwinds, although I am a little bit hesitant is foreign exchange. I mean, if rates stay where they are today and hold, then that would certainly provide some tailwinds for us. Now we\u2019ll have to see what happens at the beginning of the year, but as I said, if they hold where they are today, that should provide some uplift.  Obviously, we are excited about HPE Next. We think that\u2019s going to yield some significant savings. Now we\u2019ll have to figure out the difference between the gross and the net, but overall, that should be positive. And then we should see some benefit from the lower share count. So those are all the positives we have going into the year.  As far as some of the pressure points that we\u2019ll continue to see, although DRAM may soften a little bit, just keep in mind, we are going to have a full year impact of that versus what we had this year. So we do expect that to be a significant pressure point going into 2018, when you compare year-over-year, I mean, DRAM cost will be roughly double.  We are expecting and we will see what happens but we continue to expect to see a very difficult pricing environment. We are not anticipating that easing up in the near term. So that would provide some pressure and then we are obviously going to continue to invest in the business. But, net-net, hopefully that helps you frame it up, but given the positives and the negatives, we would certainly expect to see a significant uplift in 2018. Sherri Scribner : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then just a follow-up. Can you maybe provide some additional detail on the strength that you saw in the server business? It seems that was much better than expected and it sounded like from your commentary that that was more specific to HP and that you gained share. But maybe some additional detail would be helpful. Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, I\u2019ll take that and Tim can follow on. So, the results were quite a bit better in servers. Flat overall, but grew 12% to 13% excluding tier-1. And I\u2019d say there is a couple of things going on. One is better execution, particularly in Americas, but actually across the board. And I think that execution will continue and we expect as we said to gain a bit of share in the second quarter.  There was also some improvement frankly in the overall market and in all \u2013 or easy compares in Q3 than they were in Q1 and Q2. But I also have to say the portfolio that we have worked hard to create that we have pivoted over the last couple of years, that is in faster growing more profitable areas in the markets is starting to kick in and you can see that in High Performance Compute, you can see it in synergies momentum that is not only, the actual product of Synergy, but it\u2019s actually accelerating the core blade business.  We are also seeing good traction in hyper converge that grew triple digits, albeit off a small base. And then across Aruba continues to do very well. And interestingly on Aruba in the U.S. it reignited the wired networking business which was part of the thesis of the acquisition, but it\u2019s actually playing out very nicely in the United States. So, listen, I mean, I think the market is going to continue to be competitive. We are going to continue to face some headwinds from Tier-1s that was down versus Q3. But we are feeling much better about that core business and you really need to think about this as stabilizing the core transactional rack and tower business while we pivot the portfolio to higher margin and higher growth segments in the marketplace and that\u2019s working.  The only thing I will say is what I\u2019ve learnt over the last six years in this business, there is always something that could happen here, whether it\u2019s floods in Thailand, floods in Houston, I mean, this is a remarkable situation that we face in Houston I have to say. And so, I feel good about our execution. I feel good about what we can control. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. First question on CTP acquisition. It\u2019s quite interesting and I think a very, very good company, their primary business that I believe is trying to move on-premise customers to the cloud and particularly the AWS which is a kind of threat to your core business, but I guess you feel that having that as part of a services offering, helping customers with hybrid cloud is more important. Meg Whitman : So, listen a core part of our strategy is we make hybrid IT simple. And what CTP does very well is very consistent with our strategy which is what customers think to do is they just with their applications and their workloads. First, make sure that they\u2019ve got, they\u2019ve rationalized those workloads as fast as they \u2013 and as much as they can and then decide where each of those workloads should go based on a total cost of ownership and how they want to pay for it, whether it be on a consumption based pricing model or CapEx.  So, that\u2019s what this team does and we will add our expertise on on-prem private cloud. We\u2019ll add our expertise in \u2013 because we do some of this today and it\u2019s an opportunity to scale that practice. But listen, there are some workloads that customers probably should move to a public cloud and you know Azure is our public cloud partner.  We are excited about Azure\u2019s stack on-prem. We aim to be the leader in infrastructure behind Azure stack on-prem. And so we want to make sure that we help customers find their right mix of hybrid IT and this is a nice way to scale that business for us. Steve Milunovich : Thank you and then on the storage side, could you give us a sense of how much Nimble contributed to that revenue? I think you said 3PAR it was down, was it 9% year-over-year? Is that an effective Nimble at all? Because I think you separated where those two are going into the market. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to see too much effect from Nimble on to 3PAR? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, I would just say, All-Flash in general was up about 30% and roughly 6% organically. We did see some pressure on 3PAR to your point, that\u2019s primarily, again, we are seeing a very competitive pricing environment particularly in the U.S. in storage in 3PAR. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, listen, we are excited now about our storage portfolio. 3PAR plus Nimble, we get incremental scale, we get InfoSight which is obviously AI for the datacenter in the context of Nimble and I think one plus one here is going to equal more than two and we are really pleased, we are going to combine the R&D.  We are combining the sales specialist teams. We are leveraging, I think the strengths of both companies to give us more scale particularly in the All-Flash segment in the market which is growing. And you will recall that only about 10% of datacenters have moved to All-Flash. So there is a lot of running room there and we are a leader in that marketplace and we aim to continue that trend. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I am sure you will get into in more detail at the Analyst Day. But can you talk a bit about your thoughts on cash and use of cash? Clearly, some will be used to fund the restructuring, but what are you thinking about in terms of acquisition strategy going forward and other ways to return cash to shareholders? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, Meg you can jump in here afterwards. I think we are going to continue to operate within the framework that we have and we are going to be very disciplined. It\u2019s going to be returns based and it\u2019s going to be sort of a three-legged stool. So we are going to continue to focus on organic investments, because when we do that well, and we do it right, it\u2019s good for customers, it\u2019s good for partners, it\u2019s good for shareholders.  Think about All-Flash, think about Synergy and those types of things. Obviously, we are biased toward share repurchases right now. And then we\u2019ll also look at M&A. Again, M&A that\u2019s complementary IT that helps leverage our distribution where we can then blow out some profitable growth. So, I would expect this to continue to operate within that framework and like I said, we\u2019ll give some more color as we get into the Analyst Meeting in October. Shannon Cross : Great. And then, I am just curious when I look at the cost reductions that you are talking about travel down 21%, contract is down 14%, how much of this is sort of recurring or can be continued and how much of it is just sort of a near term reduction in your spend? And I am just trying to figure out, does it make sense to travel down 21% to support the ongoing business or is this just sort of in the interim while you are getting HP Next in place? Meg Whitman : Let me give you a little context on that. So listen, there is obviously some short-term cost reduction that we are doing. But I have to say what we have done to the $200 million to $300 million in Q3 and Q4, I do not think it\u2019s actually hurting the business. I think we are executing better than we were before and you can see that in our results.  But as we move into HPE Next, it is a much broader initiative than sort of normal cost reduction. We are essentially rearchitecting the company to be precisely built to compete and win in our markets and we are actually clean sheeting both the operating model and the organizational structure to simplify how we work and we want to take actions that optimize business processes and operations. And let me just give you a couple of examples of that and this has all become very obvious as ES has moved out. When ES went to DXE on March 31, a $28 billion business on 110,000 people left this organization and it was in some way is like the tide going out. You could see where there were real opportunities to improve and I\u2019ll give you a perfect example.  Think about platforms and SKUs and options. So we have about 50,000 live configs, live configurations in our server business. The old 80-20 rule applies. And so, as we are to really focus on the configurations that make the most difference. This will \u2013 think about it, inventory, nodes, purchasing, supply chain, everything gets simpler and easier.  Think about decreasing the layers in our customer-facing organization, so there is more accountability and decision-making closer to the customers. Reducing the number of markets that we operate in to prioritize the customers and the countries that are driving the vast majority of the business today and we\u2019ll drive almost all the growth. So this is the kind of thing we are doing. So, yes, I think the travel and the contractors are interesting and have not hurt the business, but the fundamental rearchitecture and reengineering of this business is I think very, very exciting. I think it\u2019s going to be good for customers and it\u2019s going to be good for our speed and nimbleness and agility as a company. Tim Stonesifer : And the only thing I would add to that is to Meg\u2019s point, a lot of the HPE Next stuff is very structural. So that will obviously be more run rate related. But keep in mind that savings \u2013 the $1.5 billion savings is a gross savings number.  So, again, we are going to continue to see commodity cost pressure, one of the things you\u2019ll see that we did very effectively with ES is we are going to hire people as we shift rules from high cost countries to low cost countries, we are going to be out hiring people and then we are going to continue to invest in the business. But net-net, it should drive some significant savings for the business going forward. Andy Simanek : Great. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Thinking back from looking at a bigger picture of things, is Brexit now still a headwind for the company? Are we turning the corner on Brexit? Can you talk a bit about kind of your overall demand trends? As I know for a while there is a little bit of a pause or hesitation there. Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, so, listen, I think when Brexit was first announced, we did see a pause in the demand in the UK market. No question about it because customers were trying to decide do they want to build their next datacenter in the UK or should they be building that datacenter someplace else in Europe. I think we are still feeling some after-effects from Brexit, because it\u2019s not clear exactly how this is all going to work. So I would say, the UK market is a bit challenged for us.  It\u2019s not only Brexit, it\u2019s also the public sector that is cutting back spending quite dramatically. So the UK is not one of our stronger markets. It\u2019s a very important market for us. But I wouldn\u2019t say it is doing as well as the rest of Western Europe and frankly the United States, Canada, Latin America and Asia are all outperforming the UK right now. Jim Suva : Great. Thanks so much for the details. Andy Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from James Kisner with Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead. James Kisner : Thank you. So, very nice work on servers. It\u2019s nice to see that business doing better. I was hoping you can dig into the success there. I mean, how much of that is really attributable to just product cycle with Synergy.  I was just kind of curious how you might extract the year-over-year growth rates in servers would trend over the next couple quarters as the comps get a lot easier here in a couple quarters from now? And just separately and relatedly on Cloudline, are you still committed to that product line and tell us how much of the business is coming from Cloudline? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, so, listen, I\u2019d say we are cautiously optimistic about our server business. So you are right. Synergy has made a difference, High Performance Compute has made a difference, SimpliVity has made a difference and so there is \u2013 and we talk about Synergy is also really helping our blade business. It\u2019s interesting people are buying more C-7000s because there is a roadmap to a future state.  So we are excited about that. I would also say Gen-10 is a real opportunity for us. I mentioned in my opening remarks that Gen-10 is now the industry\u2019s most secure server. This is a big issue now for everybody and we are the only server company that has built security into the silicon in our servers. So we are cautiously optimistic.  I think, I would add commodity pressure, currency, it\u2019s a very competitive pricing environment still. So, the only reason I am not even more enthusiastic is just there is challenges that remain in the market. We are executing a lot better here. Thanks to the U.S. team. Thanks to EMEA and APJ and Latin America. We are executing a lot better here than we have in the past with the stronger portfolio. Cloudline, you had a question about Cloudline.  So, listen, Tier-1 continues to be a headwind for us. It\u2019s a very lumpy business with not much profit attached to it. And so, we need to figure out what the long-term answer is on Cloudline. And so we are evaluating that right now. We will, I think have an answer by the Security Analysts Meeting about what we want to do about Cloudline on a go forward basis. And Tim you might talk a little bit about how much \u2013 I think he asked a question about\u2026 Tim Stonesifer : That\u2019s roughly, call it 10% to 15% of our Tier-1 revenue. James Kisner : Thank you very much. Andy Simanek : Great. Thanks, James. Next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Ittai Kidron : Thanks. Sorry to beat the dead horse. But I am going to think it\u2019s the servers yet again. Can you perhaps give us the year-over-year growth rate actually excluding your acquisitions as well, because there are two of them in the numbers which you did not exclude? Meg Whitman : Okay, let\u2019s see. So, you\u2019d like to know the number. So, I can tell you, High Performance Compute with 40% with SGI and 10% organically. Ittai Kidron : I am talking servers in total. You gave the number of 10% assuming Tier-1 and divestitures, but can you give it also excluding M&A and I guess, the second point Tim, how much of the growth here is \u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve managed to roll some of the price increases in DRAM into customers. I understand not all of it, clearly absorbing some of it. But, how much of the growth here is price driven versus units driven? Tim Stonesifer : So, on the organic piece, the M&A activity is roughly three points call it. And I am sorry, what was the second question about price? Ittai Kidron : Yes, how much of the growth is driven by units growth versus ASP growth? Because you have managed to increase some prices. I understand not to the full extent of the DRAM increases but prices have come up to a certain degree. I am just trying to gauge how much of the growth here is really unit driven versus ASP driven? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, I would say, it\u2019s ASP driven. But again, as we \u2013 it depends on what product line you are talking about. If you are talking servers it\u2019s ASP driven, so I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Ittai Kidron : Got it. Okay, and then for you Meg, on storage, I mean, good results there. At the same time, when you get compared on the All-Flash progress compared to a net app or pure you are still well behind from a growth standpoint. I guess, I am trying to gauge relative to the size of the business you have there, what in your opinion should the All-Flash array business grow at as we think about next year? Meg Whitman : Yes, so, I think actually, I think did a very good job of getting to All-Flash early with 3PAR and then of course Nimble and then the two competitors that you mentioned actually showed up with an All-Flash product quite recently and they\u2019ve been able to mine their installed base which we understood would happen.  So our objective is we got to go mine our installed base and then when a customer is thinking about upgrading to All-Flash, we got to make sure that we are in a competitive position there. I can\u2019t give you an estimated growth rate of All-Flash. What I can tell you is, it\u2019s faster, better, cheaper. And that is usually a winning formula for CIOs and we are seeing a huge amount of interest in All-Flash as CIOs continue to be under cost pressure and performance pressure, All-Flash is a natural opportunity for them. So, I don\u2019t know whether this will continue at a 30% growth rate, but it will be at least double-digits, I think for the foreseeable future, this is a fundamental trend in the datacenter. Ittai Kidron : All right, good luck. Meg Whitman : Thank you. Andy Simanek : Thanks, Ittai. Next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking my questions. I\u2019ve got one question and a follow-up. First, I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the federal vertical and help us understand the sizing and what assumptions you\u2019ve made or thoughts you have in terms of potential risk if there is a government shutdown? Meg Whitman : So, the federal business is an important part of our business in the United States. I think it\u2019s roughly 10% to 15% of our revenue in the United States and we have an excellent position there. We\u2019ve got longstanding relationships with almost every agency and every part of the federal government. So, a government shutdown would probably a blip honestly for us. There would be a speed bump there.  What I will say is a lot of these purchases are long head, they buy and then the delivery is over a long period of time. So probably that would not \u2013 if there was a government shutdown in October, that probably wouldn\u2019t affect us until a little bit later in 2018. But listen, the government shutdown I don\u2019t think is our friend or anyone else who sells to the government. That\u2019s not our friend and we certainly hope that will not happen. Simon Leopold : Great. And then, in terms of the follow-up, I wanted to get a better understanding of how you are thinking about the campus environment, because you did talk about very strong Aruba business and you mentioned some pull through sales of upgrades, but if we look at the campus switching environment by itself, how is that trending for you? You\u2019ve mentioned a couple of data points, but I want to see if we could quantify it. Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, let me talk a little bit about Aruba and why I think Aruba is seeing the traction that they are seeing. First is, you hear about CIOs digitalizing their environment and their interactions with customers. How many times have you heard a CIO saying I\u2019ve got to digitize my environment. In many ways, Aruba is the wedge of how that gets done. Either they are transforming their employee environment in their campuses across the world. So that it is a more modern work environment, mobile first and fundamentally changing their employee experience or it is a customer who is saying, I\u2019ve got to change my interaction with my customers and whether that is a retail environment, fast food, hospitals, government interaction.  So, Aruba is on the cutting edge of this digital transformation that every organization is undergoing and that is fundamentally what\u2019s driving demand. There is two things that differentiate Aruba. One is security. Whether that is ClearPass or Niara, we win on security virtually all the time. We have the most secure wireless network and that is an important decision criteria. There is also interesting things built into Aruba.  They bought a company called Meridian which is way finding and GPS. So whether that is way finding through a large big box retail environment, whether that is way finding through a hospital, this is a very important application that rides on top of Aruba. The other thing is asset tagging. If you think about a hospital environment, where are- most of their assets are mobile and at the end of everyday they are never where they are supposed to be and the ability to asset tag and work to the wireless network has been a big selling point for a number of different customers.  So, listen, we compete hard every day there. But it is a very rapidly growing market and we are gaining share in the campus branch and edge. So, listen, we expect that to continue. I think that the Aruba team would also tell you they have benefited by part of being a part of Hewlett Packard, because when they were Aruba people loved the product, but some big companies were a little bit hesitant to sign on to a small independent start-up while part of HPE, they know we will stand behind Aruba and that has totally helped the revenue trajectory of Aruba.  So listen, we remain optimistic and they have a fantastic product, well priced with an excellent sales force with terrific white glove service and that\u2019s another differentiator. Andy Simanek : Great. Thanks, Simon. I think we have time for one more question please. Operator : Your last question today will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hi, yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. What I\u2019d really love to get a little bit more of a view on is regards to HPE Next, like what are some of the revenue initiatives that we might expect, if you can to sort of touch on them in your dialogue earlier, but what are some of those and what might \u2013 not quantify, but the types of impacts be that you guys are looking for? Thanks a lot. Meg Whitman : Yes, so listen, we think HPE Next will have positive revenue accelerators and it really goes to two major initiatives, one is how do we make decisions on accountability much closer to the customer. So that frontline sales executives can make the decisions in the field faster. And that by increasing the agility and the decision-making, I think actually, we will do more business.  Another case on revenue acceleration is our ability to quote configurations much faster. We\u2019ve made progress on this over the last several years, but we need to make more progress. And how we change our pricing and our quoting to be much more customer-focused and customer-friendly, I think is an important element for us.  If you think about reducing the number of SKUs and options, this also makes it easier to sell, and faster to configure on offering and I think that will accelerate. And then I mentioned, probably like most companies, a small number of countries account for the vast majority of revenue and profit and will account for the growth in our industry over the next five to ten years and we want to make sure we are allocating the resources correctly to the largest countries with the countries that have the most growth and profit potential for us.  And so, I think that actually will accelerate. As you can imagine a 1% increase in the United States dwarf just about if you think of the long tail of countries that dwarfs the revenue in those long tail of countries. So those are some of the initiatives that I think by extension will impact revenue to the positive. So, we are very focused on, how do we be simpler to the business with, faster to the business with, which should result in revenue increases. Ananda Baruah : Really appreciate. Do you think you could see an impact in 2018 from any of these initiatives? Meg Whitman : We do, actually we really do. We aim to go into FY 2018 with a clean sheet operating model in a way that I hope customers will see a difference right away and frankly it would be easier for our employees to get things done. If you think about what was required to hold this company together when it was a very large multi-business company, some of those ways of doing business, we need to let go off. And I understand why it was here, it was necessary in terms of growing together such a large company, but now that we are more focused with a focused strategy and a smaller company, I think we can do better in terms of making it easier for our employees to get things done. Ananda Baruah : Really appreciate it. Good luck. Meg Whitman : Thank you very much. Andy Simanek : Thank you, Ananda. Appreciate it. I think with that we can close the call Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day.",

My name is Austin and I will be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andrew Simanek : w: Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE\u2019s filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported on HPE\u2019s annual report on Form 10-Q for fiscal year ended October 31, 2017. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Throughout this conference call all revenue growth rates unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and beginning with fiscal year 2016 are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE\u2019s operational performance. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details. With that, let me turn it over to Meg. Meg Whitman : Thanks, Andy, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As you have all seen, we have just announced that I will be stepping down as CEO of HPE at the end of Q1. Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President will become President and CEO and join the HP Board on February 1, 2018. I will remain a Director on HPE\u2019s Board. I said for many years that the next leader of HPE should come from within the company and Antonio Neri is exactly the type of leader I had in mind. Antonio is a 22-year veteran of our company who began his HP career as a customer service engineer in the EMEA call center. He is a computer engineer by training, has a deep technology background and is passionate about our customers, partners, employees and culture. The Board unanimously agreed that Antonio should be my successor. This transition is possible because of all the work we have done during the past 6 years to transform HP. Many of you will recall the challenges the company faced when I became CEO and will recognize how far we have come. During the first couple of years, we focused on strengthening the company across a number of metrics. We stabilized and strengthened the leadership team, improved productivity and reinvigorated the culture. We significantly improved customer satisfaction driving NPS scores from negative in some cases to an industry leading 80 for our services today. And we pivoted hard back towards partners, rebuilding our entire partner ecosystem and shifting resources to this critical go-to-market channel. We also rebuilt our balance sheet paying off the nearly $12 billion of operating company net debt that existed when I joined the company. I am proud that today HPE is exiting the year with nearly $6 billion in net cash. Most importantly, we reignited innovation and delivered groundbreaking new technology solutions. For example, we invested in the machine research project, which is focused on creating an entirely new computing architecture for the Big Data era putting memory at the core. We introduced the first prototype earlier this year and have also begun incorporating certain technologies from the project into solutions available today. From a much stronger position, we then looked at our portfolio and made a number of strategic decisions to further sharpen our focus and accelerate performance. The first critical step was the separation into two independent Fortune 100 companies, HPE and HP Inc. This was exactly the right decision, because it allowed both companies to optimize for strength and invest in core strategies. From there, we further separated the company by spinning off and merging our enterprise services business with CSC creating the world\u2019s largest pure-play IT services company. Next we spun off and merged our application software business with Micro Focus creating the seventh largest pure-play software company in the world. The ES and software transactions delivered more than $20 billion in value for HPE and our shareholders. We also made a number of smaller divestitures, including Tipping Point and Mphasis and we divested 51% of our China business to Tsinghua Holdings creating New H3C Group, the leading Chinese provider of technology infrastructure. This unique approach has put us in a strong position to capitalize on the second largest IT market in the world. We also made a number of strategic additions to strengthen our portfolio in key growth areas. For example, in hybrid IT, we acquired SGI to strengthen our high-performance compute business, SimpliVity to bolster our hyper-converged offering and Nimble Storage to complete our storage offering from entry-level to the high-end and accelerate our transition to all flash. We acquired Aruba, the leader in wireless networking, which has become the heart of our intelligent edge strategy. Since then, we strengthened Aruba with Niara bringing machine learning and big data analytics to network security and Rasa Networks for network performance management and analytics. And we have also enhanced our services capabilities. We acquired cloud technology partners to extend our cloud consulting expertise and Cloud Cruiser to enhance our IT consumption models like our flexible capacity offering. All of these acquisitions are highly complementary to our core business. These companies are all in growth markets and we are accelerating their performance by leveraging our go-to-market channels. We also continue to invest organically and introduce exciting new products and services. For example, we launched the industry\u2019s first composable offering called Synergy, and we now have more than 1,100 customers on the platform. In high-performance compute, we launched Apollo, which is helping to bring supercomputing capabilities to the enterprise. To address the explosion in industrial IoT, we launched our highly differentiated Edgeline Converged Systems. With security becoming a board level issue, we launched the industry\u2019s most secure standard server. And beyond product innovation, we continue to introduce new service offerings like our flexible capacity, which provides flexible pay-per-use IT for customers. The industry recognizes the progress we have made. For the first time, HPE is a Gartner Magic Quadrant leader in all of its core business categories. As a whole, these moves have paid off and I am very proud of the shareholder value we have created along the way. HP and then HPE have returned nearly $18 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends since 2012. And since the birth of HPE on November 2, 2015, we have delivered a total shareholder return of 89%, which is more than three times that of the S&P 500. I know Antonio will have the same focus on delivering value for our shareholders going forward. By fixing, improving and reposition the company I joined, HPE has worked its way into a strong competitive position ready to drive the next phase of shareholder value and you are starting to see the payoff in our results. In Q4 FY \u201817 we grew revenue 5% year-over-year capping a full year FY \u201817 where we grew the top line 1% when adjusted for currency and divestitures. We have stabilized our core rack and tower server business, which grew 6% and 7% year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 respectively. Services grew 3% in Q4 and our investments in key growth areas like the intelligent edge, high-performance compute and all-flash storage are clearly paying off. Aruba performance continues to accelerate and outpace the market growing 19% in Q4 and 22% for the year. Our high-performance compute portfolio is the best in the industry and we continue to win deals and extend our market leadership position. HPC was up 28% in Q4 and 37% for the year. From a profitability perspective, we are on the right track towards getting margins back to historic levels despite continued challenges in commodity pricing. In Q4, EG margins improved sequentially for the second quarter in a row to 10.6% as we executed our cost takeout plans and shifted resources to align with our market segmentation. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year target of 11% to 12% in FY \u201818. At every turn, HPE is preparing itself for the future. In Q4, we moved into the execution phase of HPE Next, our program to redesign the company to be purpose built for today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s competitive environment. HPE Next is all about simplifying the way we work, driving execution and investing in innovations that will differentiate our solutions in the years ahead. While executing HPE Next, we made sure to minimize disruption to the business and particularly our sales force. I am very pleased that we saw no disruption in Q4. In fact, HPE Next has galvanized the entire company around our vision to drive tremendous value for customers, partners and ultimately shareholders and all of this is being driven by the strong leadership team we have in place. In addition to Antonio, I hope it was clear at our Analyst Day last month what a deep leadership bench we have with Alain Andreoli, running hybrid IT, Ana Pinczuk, running Pointnext Services and Keerti Melkote, running Aruba, Phil Davis, our new Chief Sales Officer has already brought tremendous energy to the new role, and Irv Rothman continues to do an excellent job running financial services. Together, this team has owned and refined our go forward strategy which is crystal clear and laser focused. First, the world is becoming hybrid and we make hybrid IT simple. We do that through offerings that help customers optimize their core IT environments with secure software-defined technologies that seamlessly integrate across traditional IT and multiple public and private clouds. Hybrid IT will give customers a new level of transparency and manageability for all their applications and data from the core to the cloud to the intelligent edge. But our vision doesn\u2019t end there. Simplicity ultimately means IT that is invisible and autonomous and that is exactly what we plan to deliver. To that end just this morning, we announced that we have rolled out HPE InfoSight, our highly differentiated predictive AI technology across our entire 3PAR portfolio. This is going to be a game changer for our storage business. HPE InfoSight, which came with the Nimble acquisition, is the industry leading predictive analytics platform that brings software-defined intelligence to the data center with the ability to predict and prevent infrastructure problems before they happen. Leveraging advanced machine learning, HPE InfoSight is the next step in our vision for an autonomous data center. And next week at Discover Madrid, we will officially introduce Project New Stack. New Stack is all about what our customers want most, simplicity and control. It\u2019s a hybrid IT management platform that lets you deploy, operate and optimize public cloud and on-prem private cloud environments through a simple and unified experience and it will accelerate app development and deployment with integrated DevOps capabilities. This is what our customers have been asking for and no one else in the market can match the platform we have created. Second, we power the intelligent edge. We have highly differentiated offerings in this area that are helping customers drive a revolution across their business from the factory floor to the retail store, whether it is with our wired and wireless connectivity offerings from Aruba that allow customers to securely connect edge environments and drive new experiences for their customers, employees and new revenue streams for their bottom line, our Edgeline Converged Systems that bring storage and compute directly to the source of the data that needs to be analyzed or our universal IoT software platform that seamlessly integrates data from disparate IoT systems at massive scale. These are all areas where we are well ahead of the market and the industry is taking notice. Earlier this fall, Aruba was named a leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless networking and placed first provision. This is the first time that Cisco has ever been displaced from this position. Third, services are more critical than ever. More and more everything we do is driven by our services expertise across advisory, professional and operational services. We are also seeing growing interest in consumption services as our customers look to us for financial flexibility through pay-per-use models. Our offering in this area, Flexible Capacity is different than anything else on the market. Through our services led solutions, combining hardware, software and financing, we make operating IT simple and elastic and because we offer pay-per-use model based on metered usage, customers never overpay on technology they don\u2019t use. Look out for more news in this area at Discover next week. Let me say in closing that it has been the privilege of a lifetime to lead the company Founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. I am proud of what we have accomplished during the past 6 years. We have laid out a strong foundation for a prosperous future and now is the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins. I look forward to experiencing HPE\u2019s progress as a board member and I am very confident that Antonio will enjoy tremendous success. And now, I will hand the call over to Tim who will provide details on the financial results. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks, Meg. Before I jump into the results, I just want to thank you for your tireless leadership of HP and personal mentorship to me over the past 2 years. I\u2019ll miss our day-to-day interaction, but look forward to working with you as a board member and partnering closely with Antonio going forward. In fact, I joined HP as the CFO of Antonio\u2019s business, so we have a longstanding relationship that will make this transition seamless. So, turning to our performance, in Q4, we saw solid revenue growth, sequential operating margin improvement and better-than-expected earnings. Our results in the quarter, gives me confidence that we are making the right moves to deliver our fiscal year \u201818 commitments and drive long-term shareholder value. Total revenue for the quarter was $7.8 billion. This includes $174 million or 1 month of software, which is accounted for in discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations was $7.7 billion, up 5% and when excluding Tier 1 server sales, was up over 11%. I will dive into the business segment performance in a minute. From a macro perspective, we continue to see a broadly improving IT spend environment, but competitive pricing and commodities remain headwinds. The exchange rate improved in the quarter leading to a neutral impact year-over-year in Q4. By region, HPE\u2019s performance in the Americas remain steady as core compute stabilized and networking growth accelerated offset somewhat by softer organic storage results. Revenue in Europe was also driven by networking and continue to grow with mid single-digit growth in Germany, France and Iberia. Asia-Pacific delivered strong core server sales, with growth in Japan, Australia, India and China. Turning to margins, the gross margin of 29.7% was down 210 basis points year-over-year, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.2% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially. In addition to normal seasonality, we saw continued benefit from our cost takeout actions and from a better mix as we continue to shift our focus towards the value and growth segments of the market and away from custom commoditized servers. These benefits help offset the continued challenging pricing environment and elevated commodity costs, with DRAM increasing another 5% to 10% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.31 is above our previous outlook of $0.26 to $0.30 primarily due to more cost savings, a lower tax rate and favorable other income and expense. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes pre-tax amount for transformation of restructuring charges of $439 million, separation costs of $272 million, amortization of intangible assets of $96 million, and Hurricane Harvey related charges of $93 million offset by separation-related income tax adjustments of $785 million. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.00 to $0.04 due primarily to a non-cash income tax benefit as a result of transactions we undertook in connection with the software spin-merge and in anticipation of potential tax reform. Now, turning to the results by business, in the enterprise group, revenue was up 1% year-over-year and up 7% excluding Tier 1 server sales. As we stabilized the core RAC and tower servers business and saw strong momentum in key growth areas like Aruba wireless, campus switching, all-flash storage and Point Next. Operating margins were down 270 basis points year-over-year. However, they improved 130 basis points sequentially to 10.6%. The sequential margin improvement is primarily the result of the cost savings plans we are executing and mix benefits from lower Tier 1 server sales and higher Point Next revenue. Server revenue was down 5% year-over-year, but grew 6% excluding Tier 1 as we executed our plans to exit the custom commoditized server market. We executed well in our core RAC and tower server business driving 7% growth as richer attached configurations through higher AUPs. Looking forward, as discussed at our Analyst Meeting, we are changing our approach to the volume server segment by exiting custom commoditized servers and moving to a low or no-touch model for core RAC and tower. This will make us easier to work with and will help us further expand our profitability. In our value and growth portfolio which carries higher margins and better services attached, high-performance compute grew almost 30% with SGI and 2% organically. And Synergy also continues to ramp growing over 60% sequentially and now has over 1,100 customers. Storage revenue was up 5% driven by the Nimble acquisition. All-flash arrays grew 16% year-over-year with Nimble, up over 80%, which continues to outpace expectations. 3PAR performance was soft due to a tough competitive environment in the mid-range and some go-to-market challenges in America. We are addressing these challenges head-on by bringing together the Nimble and 3PAR sales team under a new leader, Keegan Riley, who led sales at Nimble and are aggressively hiring more storage specialists for the field. As Meg mentioned, we are also rolling out InfoSight, Nimble\u2019s predictive AI technology across our entire 3PAR portfolio. We are confident that these actions will quickly turn things around. Networking continues to perform very well, with revenue up 21% driven by campus switching, which was up 28% and Aruba wireless solutions which grew over 19%. We continue to be encouraged by the very strong Aruba led pull-through of wired switching, reinforcing both the Aruba investment thesis and the strength of the new Aruba branded switching portfolio. We are also getting excellent feedback from our new Aruba core aggregation switch. In total, networking grew across all product groups and geographies. Technology services, including Point Next grew revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter, up 3% year-over-year. Orders return to growth up 3% year-over-year led by better than 4% growth in support. Within support, both attach and non-attach orders grew with double-digit growth in flex capacity and data center care. We also continue to increase our services intensity, which offset lower hardware unit sales. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 22% driven by a large one-time lease buyout and continued lease conversion. Excluding these items, revenue increased 1%, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Financing volume was down 2% as solid growth in our direct business was offset by declines in our indirect business. Operating profit declined 250 basis points year-over-year to 7.7% reflecting one-time items and the increased operating lease mix. Return on equity for Q4 was 13.2%, up 210 basis points sequentially. So looking back at the quarter, I am pleased with the progress we have made and encouraged by not only our improving financial performance, but also many customer wins. For instance, the NASA Langley Research Center is now using our HPC clusters to test and help solve problems involving the physics of advanced propulsion. We expect our relationship with NASA to grow as we add capability to their new HPC data center going forward. CenturyLink, the second largest U.S. communication provider shows 3PAR with data center care support for recent IT refresh. Aruba announced a partnership with Purdue University\u2019s College of Agriculture to help develop and deliver a digital agricultural program that will revolutionize farming and food production for a growing global population. Point Next won a significant deal with the Walt Disney Company and we are helping the biggest and oldest bank in India, the State Bank of India with its digital transformation. These are just a few of the many wins we had in the quarter, but I think they demonstrate the solid momentum we are seeing and some of the opportunity ahead. Now, turning to cash flow, free cash flow was better than expected at $370 million benefiting from continued improvement in working capital. The cash conversion cycle improved 6 days sequentially to negative 27 days driven primarily by increased payment terms. We returned $725 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $105 million in dividend payments and $620 million of share repurchases. For the full year, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in line with the commitment we laid out at the beginning of the year. We ended the year with our operating company net cash balance of $5.8 billion slightly below our guided range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion due to the timing of a payment associated with the spin-merge balance sheet true-ups. We anticipate receiving this payment of approximately $200 million in Q1 of \u201818. Turning to our outlook, we recently gave detailed fiscal year \u201818 guidance at our Security Analyst Day and I encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. However, I think it\u2019s worth reiterating a few points. We continue to expect fiscal year \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.15 to $1.25. We expect normalized free cash flow of $2 billion and as reported free cash flow of $1 billion and we remain committed to returning $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of $2 billion a share buybacks and $500 million of dividends, which we just increased by 15% from $6.5 cents to $7.5 cents per share each quarter. Our board also recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $5 billion. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, fiscal year \u201818 EPS will be backend loaded towards the second half. There are few reasons for this. First, the cost savings, the business implication benefits from HPE next will ramp throughout the year. Also the earnings contributions from our recent acquisitions will become more accretive as the year progresses. We\u2019ll also see the benefits from share buybacks, compound throughout the year. And we should get a natural mix benefit as our higher margin value products and services become a greater percentage of our business. As a result we expect Q1 \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share $0.20 to $0.24 and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be a $0.01 to $0.05. Now, before I turn it over to Q&A, I want to briefly touch on our reporting structure for next year. Beginning in fiscal year \u201818 we\u2019ll report three segments : hybrid IT, which includes servers, storage, data center networking and point next. Intelligent edge, which includes wireless LAN, campus and branch switching, edge compute and Aruba services, and lastly financial services. This new cut of our business more accurately reflects how we go to market and how we\u2019ve begun to manage the business internally in fiscal year \u201818 we\u2019ll provide restatement tables towards the end of our first quarter. So overall like, Meg, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance this year. The work we have been doing over the past couple of years is paying off and we are well-positioned for fiscal year \u201818. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thank you. I just wanted to dig a little bit into the different segments if you look at the storage business it decelerated a little bit and I guess I would\u2019ve thought that storage might have grown a little bit more sequentially. Was that primarily related to some of the issues at 3PAR because it sounds like the all-flash array and the Nimble business are doing well? Meg Whitman : Yes, so \u2013 it\u2019s Meg, the storage revenue was up 5% driven by the Nimble acquisition and as you said the all flash arrays grew 16% with Nimble was up over 80%. So a good performance overall, but as Tim mentioned 3PAR performance was soft due to I think a very tough competitive environment in the \u2013 in the mid-range and then some sales challenges in the United States. So we are taking action. We are combining the Nimble and 3PAR storage sales teams which is going to give us more critical mass there and that\u2019s going to be led by Keegan Riley, who led sales at Nimble. And we are also going to aggressively add some more specialists to the field. So I think you hit it right on the head a little weakness in the U.S. and we are fixing it. Tim Stonesifer : I think also InfoSight will help as we roll that across the 3PAR portfolio. Sherri Scribner : Okay, great. And then just on the server business that also decelerated, but I know you have a strategy shift in that business. Was part of the decline in service related to that strategy shift and as we move into \u201818 should we expect the server business to decline because of the less focus on the lower margin business? Thanks. Meg Whitman : Yes. No, I think you have got this exactly right. Servers had another strong quarter outside of Tier 1. Remember, we had quite a large Tier 1 service provider business that had a fair amount of revenue, but not much profit associated with it, but outside that, it grew 6% and I think that was execution, market improvement and some good traction in our higher value offerings. So in addition to stabilizing core rack and tower we are pivoting hard to our value and growth offerings like HPC, Synergy, SimpliVity, etcetera. But you will see some declines in the server business next year as that Tier 1 business continues to bleed off. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the server comments. Curious whether Intel [Indiscernible] product cycle is impacting the business yet or is that a catalyst that you think hits in calendar 2018? And then when you think about annualizing the Tier 1 base of business, when do you think the server category on a reported basis can get back to growth? Meg Whitman : So, why don\u2019t you take ex-Tier 1 server growth and I will take the other question. Tim Stonesifer : Sorry about that. Yes, as far as the Tier 1 component, I would say that probably runs off to an immaterial amount probably in the late 2019-2020 timeframe. Meg Whitman : Great. And then listen, our Gen10 server, which is on the new Intel chip called Skylake, is off to a good start. There is some concern in the industry that because there is not quite the features and functionality advancement that there normally is in their tick-tock that, that might be a slower ramp, but thus far we are not seeing that. So, we are cautiously optimistic about Gen10. What I will say about \u2013 based on Skylake, what I will say about Gen10 is we have a real point of difference in Gen10 which is we have produced the most secure server in the world. Security is built in as a root of trust into the silicon. No one else has anything like this and this is making a real difference, because security continues to be an enormous issue for everyone. So let\u2019s stay tuned on Skylake. We are not seeing any diminution of that tick-tock, but we will have to see how it plays out. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. One for Meg and then maybe one for Tim or Meg. Meg just in terms of the timing of your announcement to hand over the reins to Antonio, I got to say I am a little surprised I think in the last 3 months you have said things like I am not going anywhere and there is still more work to do and I have no plans to leave. And so this in light of those comments feels a little abrupt. I am wondering if maybe you can add some color in terms of was there a change of heart, I would certainly say that there is still a long ways to go in terms of improvement in the server business and margins were down almost 300 basis points year-over-year. So, there still is a lot of work. And so it\u2019s not entirely obvious to an outsider that HP is at some ready point for a change. So, maybe you could add some color? Meg Whitman : Yes. So, Tony, I would say there hasn\u2019t been a change in sentiment. What I think is absolutely true is Antonio is ready to take the reins and go the distance. And if you think about it, we have a much smaller, much nimbler, much more focused company. And I think it is absolutely the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins. We have got a very good leadership bench. We have got a strategy that is crystal clear and focused. And Antonio is a deep technologist. And I think I have added a lot of value here in terms of shareholder value creation, financial restructuring, nice ignition of the innovation engine, but the next CEO of this company needs to be a deeper technologist and that\u2019s exactly what Antonio is. He has been with the company 22 years. He is a trained computer engineer and has worked in almost every business of this company. So, I just think it\u2019s the right thing. And I also think Antonio is going to lead the next phase of value creation. We have created a lot of shareholder value here. I think over 220% shareholder value from right before the announcement of the turnaround in the fall of 2012, just HPE alone 89% increase since the separation, which is three times the S&P 500 and HPE Next and the simplification of our business and the execution of the strategy that Antonio and I put together between the two of us, he is going to lead that next generation of shareholder value creation. Toni Sacconaghi : And then just secondly and separately, you had commented on DRAM prices being up another 5% or 10% this quarter. I am wondering, a) if you can comment on why that doesn\u2019t make you less confident about your ability to hit margin targets and, b) whether you can comment on whether the competitive pricing environment has improved at all? Quite frankly, I was looking for more in terms of sequential margin improvement in the enterprise group, especially giving all the cost-cutting you are doing. And I am wondering if you gave some of that back, because of DRAM and competition? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, I would say the margin expansion if you look at Q4 the 10.6 was up 130 basis points. So, we were to continue to improve margins primarily driven by the $200 million to $300 million cost actions that we talked about in Q2 of \u201817. What gives us confidence despite DRAM is up another 5% to 10% in Q4. As we look forward into 2018, we still have a lot of tailwinds, right. We talked about it at SAM. So if you look at HPE Next that $250 million of net savings we are on track to do that now. I will say that is roughly two thirds of that is in the back half of the year. So as you think about quarterly splits and margins I would take that into account, but we feel very good about what\u2019s going on there we continue to right size the cost envelopes of the recent acquisitions that we\u2019ve done those will become more, more accretive as we go through 2018. So we have a lot of things that we think will continue to improve margins and we still feel based on what everything you see today, we feel good about 11% or 12%. Meg Whitman : The other thing I\u2019d add to that Toni is this strategy to pivot to the value in the growth segments of our portfolio is absolutely critical because, just a mix shift of a couple of percent actually increases the operating margin. And we anticipate that that will happen as we realign the sales force, as we focus marketing on the value and growth segment and we realize the potential of \u2013 of the portfolio. I would say the competitive pricing environment is maybe slightly mitigated, but it would be hard for me to gauge that, because it varies by country, it varies by product line and it shifts from month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter. So while I would say overall, there\u2019s been some mitigation in that pricing environment I would not say it is universal and we\u2019re not counting on that for the delivery of our operating margin in 2018. And then DRAM pricing appears to now be leveling out and you talk to people in the industry, it appears that supply is now beginning to match demand there is going to be more supply I think from the key vendors of memory and so we\u2019ll see what happens. We are not counting by the way on to deliver our results on a drop in DRAM pricing, we\u2019re also not counting on another 15%, 20% increase in DRAM pricing, but we feel pretty good about the way where we are and I got a lot of confidence that we are going to hit our $1.15 to $1.20 and the 11% to 12% operating margin. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you, Meg. Andrew Simanek : Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a bit more into the issues on the sales side and how they sort of came to the forefront and obviously what you\u2019re doing to mitigate them, but then also just want to think about as you go through and really revamp your sales structure and collapse level that you talked about during the Analyst Day, what are you doing to make sure that you don\u2019t see softness in revenue around that shift? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, good question. So during Q4,we moved aggressively from the design phase of HPE Next to the execution phase of HPE Next and we are very focused on minimizing disruption particularly with the sales team, but other areas as well. And so we\u2019re leveraging a lot of the best practices that enabled us to deliver our recent separations on time, on budget it was the divestiture management office approach or the separation management approach. And so in Q4, we\u2019ve already begun implementing the sales changes, I mean those are done actually we started in November 1, with a lot of changes, but we did a lot of changes in Q4 as well. We dismantled actually the region overhead structure, we refocused our sales force, we put more specialists in the field and we saw no impact to frontline sales from those changes that we made in Q4. So that gives us confidence. And they went started November 1, all firing on all cylinders with the new organization and with a couple of months under their belt. So we feel pretty good about that. Outside the storage challenge in the U.S. was largely around not enough specialists in the field and frankly we need more scale in our storage sales here and combining Nimble and 3PAR under Keegan Riley, I think is going to really help here. Tim Stonesifer : Outside the U.S. sales front is radically simplify in our comp plans. So we went from say 400s or so type of comp plans down to 25 core plans or so, so folks will be very focused. We simplified that. We think that will be helpful as well. Meg Whitman : And lastly Shannon, I would say we didn\u2019t talk about it much, but Hurricane Harvey disrupted our supply chain in a reasonably dramatic fashion. Tim mentioned, it was $93 million of cost to recover from Hurricane Harvey and that does not include Puerto Rico. And so we had to divert a lot of our Houston manufacturing to Europe and then airfreight those products back into the United States. So, we have announced that we are no longer going to be manufacturing in Houston, any U.S. required manufacturing will be done in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin and then we are redistributing our manufacturing to locations around the world. So, that was another part of the weakness, some weakness in Q4. The good news is we go into Q1 with a nice backlog, because we just simply couldn\u2019t turn the supply chain on a dime. So, we have got a really nice backlog going into Q1. Shannon Cross : Okay, thank you. And then Tim, can you just talk a little bit about maybe the progression of margins as we think about 2018? You said back-end loaded, but I am just kind of curious given all the cost-cutting we have done now and that how we should really think about the ramp and do you think you can get back to some of the more historical levels when we get towards the end of the year? Thank you. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. I think \u2013 again I think we feel very good about the 11% to 12% in \u201818. We will be low in Q1. I mean if you go from Q4 to Q1 we have typical seasonality. So, if you go back to \u201817 or \u201816 or \u201815 and look at the EGOP, you will see some of that seasonality. The other thing that you have will be when we took out that $200 million of $300 million of costs in the second half of last year, not all of that was run-rate. So, although we will see cost savings going forward when you compare Q4 to Q1 we will be a little bit lighter. So, Q1 margins will be still pressured, but then as you go forward again if you look at that $250 million of cost savings as I said earlier roughly two-thirds of that or so is in the second half. So, you can load it up that way. The M&A again as we continue to right-size the cost envelopes of that, that will continue to progress as we go out through the course of the year. So \u2013 and then mix, nice point as we continue to grow Aruba all-flash high-performance compute and those product lines become a heavier mix, we should get a natural lift. So, we would expect to see Q1 margins somewhat pressured, but those will continue to improve throughout the course of the year and wound up in the 11% to 12% range. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. First a question for Antonio, then a question for Tim and I will kind of ask them at the same time. Antonio since you had a very tough\u2026. Andrew Simanek : We just have Meg and Tim on the call. Jim Suva : Got it. Okay, well, I guess given his very prevalent stage time, is it fair to say that internally the strategy of HP is what we heard from you, Meg at the Investor Day or sometimes with the leadership change they say hey, we have the HPE Next program analysis and HPE Next 2 program or something like that? And the question for Tim is on financial services that went up a lot and can you help us understand about that? I think it was up over 20% year-over-year. Yet you talked about volumes relatively consistent \u2013 are you offering more advantageous terms or how do we connect the dots of what\u2019s going on there with that financial services? Meg Whitman : Yes, let me answer the strategy question. So, the strategy will remain entirely consistent. It was crafted by Antonio and I. he has been leading HPE Next. So, I don\u2019t think he is going to lead another one in terms of reinventing that. And we are completely aligned on the strategy. As is the sales team, as is the entire organization and by the way it\u2019s working, you can see it working in the field. So, you can expect entirely consistent strategy from Antonio. Tim Stonesifer : And as far as financial services goes that 22% was driven by two things. We did have a large one-time lease buyout as well as the fact that we have a heavier mix of operating leases as compared to last year. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the 22%. If you strip those two items out to get a more normalized view, we have about 1% growth. But that business continues to perform well. We are growing and that was our sixth consecutive quarter. If you look at our loss ratios and our remarketing capabilities, the team is doing a nice job. Jim Suva : Thanks so much for the details. It\u2019s greatly appreciated. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Jim. Can we go on to the next question please? Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. My two questions would be first of all for Tim, can you quantify the impact on gross margin from the higher commodity costs during the year and the NAND you had some issues earlier and you\u2019re just getting enough NAND for storage is that no longer an issue and then second for Meg maybe you could just kind of step back and think about over your tenure at HPE. How your \u2013 what you have heard that\u2019s different from customers both in terms of how they think about their investing in technology and also how they view HPE? Tim Stonesifer : Okay. On the commodity cost 10% lift its hold for the course of the year again assuming the same pricing dynamics is probably couple $100 million. So over the course of the year and as far as NAND goes we have had supply constraint earlier in the year those are fairly minimal now and there have been some limited price increases there, but not to the extent of the memory. Meg Whitman : Yes, so what I would say is that HPE is a whole lot more relevant to customers and partners then it was. This was an enormous conglomerate and you would go in front of customers he\u2019d be talking PCs Superdome Integrity X servers, Enterprise Services, Software and they weren\u2019t sure what we stood for and it was just way too broad and we were not executing with the right R&D against any of those segments. So now HPE is more relevant they know what we stand for and the core value proposition is the software defined data center on-prem with public cloud like economics. This whole moved to flexible capacity and a pay-per-use model is actually encouraging people to say, do I need to move every workload to the public cloud. And then our new stack offering, our new stack announcement discovered next week, I think it\u2019s going to be a milestone and a cap stone in some ways to the innovation and agenda that\u2019s we\u2019ve driven over the last 6 years. So I\u2019d say that those are the main things, I would also say the speed at which we move this company was a slower company then I would have like to seen 6 years ago, and now we jump on opportunities on problems it\u2019s far more nimble, far more agile and I think you frankly just a better run company than it was 6 years ago. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Hi, thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess couple of questions from me as well. When I look at the fiscal \u201818 guide, which you guys are talking about the Q1 historically, Q1 is the kind of about 20% to 23% of full year EPS and implications about 17.5%, so it seems like a much more back end loaded year than normal. Could you just talk about what other lever that give you comfort that back half will be so much better and is it all really around the restructuring initiative, is it different levers of growth vector that you have in the back half that give you confidence here? Tim Stonesifer : Yes. Again, I will go back to two things. As far as looking at last year\u2019s seasonality as an example, it\u2019s a little bit skewed because of one, the memory costs increases, so again remember last year that increase didn\u2019t happen until call at the latter part of January. So whereas when you look at this year we have a full year impact or full quarter impact of that elevated DRAM costs pressure. Again I\u2019ll go back it\u2019s really I think the biggest driver is HPE Next. So when you look at that $250 million of cost savings again two thirds of that are roughly two thirds of that is in the back half of the year and the reason that is when we\u2019re doing this clean sheet exercise we\u2019re being very thoughtful as one how can we implement this correctly, and then two how do we minimize business disruption. So if you think as an example the simplification of the regional structure the reducing the platform, the SKU rationalization, that does take a little time to work through, because we want to make sure we get that right. So we minimize any business disruption, so that\u2019s really the primary driver along with the M&A that I spoke about and some of the other things, but the HPE Next is the big driver. Meg Whitman : And I think you mentioned that but just it\u2019s important to note that the number of these acquisitions when we acquired them, were actually losing money and so we have now worked that of and I think virtually all of them will be accretive in 2018. Amit Daryanani : That\u2019s really helpful. If I just follow-up on the storage side, maybe I missed it, but could you quantify how much of a headwind or how much revenues you think you left on the table, because of some of the go-to-market challenges that you alluded to and the timeline to resolve it you think it\u2019s done in 90 days or is it a bit more of a longer timeframe? Meg Whitman : So, we can\u2019t. I don\u2019t think we will quantify that on this call. What I would say is I think the sales team is hitting the ground running on storage. Phil Davis who is our new Head of Sales comes from a storage background. So, I think you will naturally see him pivot harder to storage than perhaps some of our earlier sales leaders. And so I think you will see improvement in the U.S. And by way, we did very well in EMEA, very well in APJ. So, I think you will see an improvement in the U.S. in the storage space. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Simon. Next question please. Operator : Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Pivotal Research Group. Please go ahead. Lou Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. Maybe if you could just mention to us what you are planning to do with all your extra time and maybe not mention that you will spend more time with family. And specifically, any chance or do you have a restriction from going to competitor? And I have a follow-up? Meg Whitman : So, first of all, I am going to work with Antonio through the transition at the end of January and then I will be a very active board member. And actually after a 35 year nonstop career, I have actually come to take a little downtime, but there is no chance, I am going to a competitor, no chance. Listen I have to say I become quite loyal to Hewlett-Packard and to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, I love this company and I would never go to a competitor. Lou Miscioscia : Okay. Then my follow-up to hit on I guess storage again I am obviously very familiar with the Analyst Meeting that you just had and that you have had at Nimble has done very well, but when you look at the product line, I think it\u2019s much more block associated not as much unstructured and unstructured data is really where the majority of the growth is. So, I am just wondering is it really a sales problem or do you actually possibly have to add more products to the product line and/or possibly do another acquisition? Meg Whitman : Yes. So, listen I think the storage business is benefiting from the explosion of data and we are seeing that every single day. We are also benefiting by storage becoming embedded in server architecture. InfoSight I think is going to be a major game changer for our storage business is part of the reason that Nimble is growing at 80% is because it\u2019s AI for the storage arrays in a way that does predictive analytics and predictive maintenance. With regard to acquisitions, you know what, when I came to this company I think we had a somewhat less than stellar reputation on acquisitions. And I think the acquisition profile that had been successful for us whether it\u2019s Aruba or SimpliVity, etcetera is the following. Is there a complementary technology to one that we already own that can benefit by being \u2013 by leveraging our distribution channels, listen Aruba has accelerated its growth rate under HP, because we can introduce the Aruba product line to customers. They had no way to get into before and also customers tell me everyday that they buy Aruba, because it\u2019s not a standalone small startup company, it\u2019s backed by big HP from a service perspective, from a warranty perspective etcetera. So, those are the kind of acquisitions that we look at. So, if we found something that we thought was important in the storage business that benefited from our distribution channel and we saw a good business case and it was priced right, we might think about doing it. But I think you have seen Tim and I would be very disciplined about acquisitions, returns based by the company right and have a very clear business case, whether it\u2019s cost take-out or acceleration. And I promise you that Antonio and Tim will continue that disciplined approach to acquisitions. And I will be on the board to make sure they do. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Lou. I think we have time for one last question please. Operator : Our last question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Just move to the networking business for a little bit. Two here. First on the campus switching side, could you talk it\u2019s obviously done really well the last few quarters and the synergies with Aruba have helped. Could you talk a little bit about Cisco\u2019s new product portfolio with kind of the pay-as-you-go model? What impact do you think that will have on that business will be an opportunity for you? Will it move your business to more recurring revenue models as well? And then secondly, if you could just update us on the data center piece and how the partnership with the rest is going? Thank you. Meg Whitman : Yes, so you are right. Aruba, both wired and wireless, has had a really great fiscal year \u201817. And the thesis when we bought Aruba was the wireless would actually drag along the wired and that has actually turned out to be the case, particularly in the United States, where the wired portfolio had a great \u201817 in a particularly strong Q4. Increasingly, we see demand for Aruba on a flexible capacity model. And just like any other product that we sell, we are happy to do a flexible capacity model pay-as-you-go, annuity-based revenue stream for people who want to buy that way for Aruba. We also I think are benefiting from the Gartner Magic Quadrant that I referred to or Tim referred to in the script where we are for the first time a leader in networking in the vision category and it\u2019s been \u2013 this is the first time in three decades that Cisco has not owned that top spot and we can feel the momentum in the marketplace. So, listen a number of our competitors are talking about a clone of flex capacity, would we dig into it, it is actually not the same thing as we are offering, it\u2019s not entwined with services and it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s really just sort of glorified leasing model and that\u2019s different from what we are offering. So, we think we have a competitive advantage. With regard to Arista, so that partnership continues to go along. We are opening up our channel in our direct sales group to the data center opportunity. And I think it\u2019s going along nicely. I think we can do better. At the moment it\u2019s going along quite nicely and I think we are both pleased with where we are, but there could be more there. Tim Long : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Tim. I think with that, we can wrap up today\u2019s call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our Web site for details. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As you all know, February 1st marked my first day as the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. As a 23 years veteran of the company, I am honored to take on this role and excited about the opportunities ahead. Many of those opportunities exist, thanks to Meg Whitman's tremendous leadership during past six and a half years. Meg set us on the current path and together we developed a strategy to take this company well into the future. I look forward to executing on that plan and I am very grateful that Meg remains on our Board. Our strong Q1 performance is proof that we have the right strategy and improved execution. We have good revenue growth across every business segment, continued to execute HPE Next with no disruption to the business and delivered strong shareholder return in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Overall revenue of $7.7 billion was up 11% from the prior year, driven by growth across each of our business segments. From a macro perspective, we are seeing some improvement in market conditions and a higher average unit prices, as pricing catches up to increases in DRAM costs. In addition, we have strengthened our execution across a number of fronts and are driving better attachment of core industry standard server business. While we don't expect these rates of growth to continue given tougher compares in the second half of the year, the go to market changes we have made in our [indiscernible] portfolio mix have put us in a strong position. I will talk more about the business segment performance in a minute. From an overall profitability perspective, we are making great progress on HPE Next, which is running cost savings as planned. The actions we have taken are helping us offset the continue margin impact from elevated DRAM cost and competitive pricing pressure. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 7.7%. And we remain on track to achieve our fiscal year '18 margin outlook of approximately 9.5%. Looking forward, we expect HPE Next to deliver the results we laid out in October. We have completed several critical parts of the program, including the sales force transformation, which significantly reduce the spans and layers between the CEO and the frontline and streamline a number of sales compensation plans. The fact that we were able to deliver the results we did in Q1 is evidence of our ability to execute HPE Next without disrupting the business. In addition to our strong revenue performance and continued cost discipline, we have a number of favorable onetime items that impacted our EPS, including benefits from tax reform. Tim will provide the details on those in a minute. With all that in mind, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, which is $0.12 above the midpoint of our previously provided outlook. As a result of our performance in Q1, as well as continued benefits from a lower tax rate, we are raising our fiscal year '18 non-GAAP EPS outlook to $1.35 to $1.45 from our previously provided outlook of $1.15 to $1.25. In addition, given the tax reform, which provide easier access to offshore cash, we are increasing our shareholders return commitment and our investment in our employees. From a capital allocation perspective, we now plan to deploy the excess cash on our balance sheet and expect to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends by the end of fiscal year '19. This includes a [15%] [ph] increase in our dividend, beginning in the third quarter of this fiscal year. Tim will provide more details on capital allocation in a minute but I remain committed to following the same vigorous disciplined ROI based approach you saw under Meg\u2019s leadership. We also plan to take advantage of tax reform to increase our investment in our employees, by significant increase in the company 401(k) margin contribution and creating new degree of systems programs to encourage development and learning. Now, I will give some additional color on our performance in the quarter. As you know, we have defined our strategy, built our portfolio based on the market disruptions we\u2019re all experiencing, driven by the digital transformation and the resulting explosion of applications and data. At HP, we help our customers extract critical insights from their data to accelerate business outcomes. We enable our customers to harvest, store and analyze the critical data that improves customer experiences, drive new business models and increases employee productivity. HP strategy is to help customer drive business outcomes by leveraging their data from the Edge to core to cloud, through our three strategic pillars; we power intelligent Edge, we make hibernating simple and we use our services expertise to accelerate successful business outcomes for customers. First, we power intelligent Edge. The Edge is the word outside the data center, and it is where digital transformation begins. It is where enterprises interact with their customers where employees come together and where companies manufacture their products. We are seeing a data power evolution happening at the Edge as customers leverage the unprecedented amount of data being created to drive their businesses. We have highly differentiated offerings in this space, including wireless LAN, network switching and converge Edge systems that bring together compute, storage, security and artificial intelligence, allowing customers to create truly intelligent Edge environments. In the first quarter, we saw continued momentum in our intelligent Edge business, which grew 9% year-over-year with strengths in campus switching and services. In wireless access, we got off to a slow start in the quarter and faced a tough compare due to the large Home Depot deal in the prior year. We saw momentum pick up as we move through the quarter and expect to return to growth with the help of our strong pipeline. Given the significant opportunity we see, the intelligent Edge is the key area of investment for us and our innovation continues to be recognized in the market. For example, in January Aruba ClearPass was the first in industry to be awarded Common Criteria certification by the national information assurance partnership. Essentially, these validation provides the highest level of security certification an organization can achieve and demonstrate Aruba's commitment to providing customers with the industry\u2019s most secure solutions for moving under a wired and Wi-Fi network infrastructures. And we continue to win new customers. For example, in Q1, Wellington Management, one of the world's largest independent investment management firms, purchased mobility access switches and Aruba ClearPass for secure network access control. We also had a win for Aruba ClearPass with the U.S. Airforce Academy, and Royal Dutch Shell selected Aruba wireless LAN for the new wireless standard worldwide. Next, I will turn to the second pillar of our strategy, Hybrid IT. We believe the world is becoming hybrid as each customer embraces their right mix of traditional IT, private cloud and public cloud environments. HP help customers simplify this hybrid IT reality with secure software refined technologies and infrastructure solutions that they are optimized to the specific workloads and data needs. Overall, hybrid IT revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in compute, storage and datacenter networking. In compute, revenue grew 11% year-over-year, driven by growth in core ISS, high performance computer, hyper converge and synergy. While we are seeing some market improvement and higher AUPs, we also executed well and seen positive customer momentum around the new secure software refined solutions we have brought to the market. In storage, revenue grew 24% year-over-year, driven by the Nimble acquisition and improved 3PAR performance. As planned, we are seeing the positive impact from go-to-market changes we have laid, particularly in the United States. And late last year, we rolled out HPE InfoSight across our entire converge and all-flash storage portfolio. HPE InfoSight is a predictive analytics platform that uses software refined intelligence to predict and prevent infrastructure problems before they happen. This product, which came two HP with Nimble, is a game changer for our storage business and is a major step on our journey to an autonomous datacenter. In datacenter networking, revenue grew 27% year-over-year, driven by strong execution within our install base. Our differentiator in Hybrid IT is our software defined services led approach, which help customers navigate through the transformation challenges I talked about earlier. Our Pointnext services organization is at the heart of that approach. It is also key to our customers\u2019 growing interest in alternative consumption models that give financial flexibility through pay per use alternatives enabled by our soft innovation. I would talk about our newest offerings in this area in a minute. In Q1, Pointnext revenue grew 2% year-over-year and orders were flat. We made progress on the initiatives we laid out during our security add-ons made in October, including rationalizing the number of countries that we offer services in an alternating our core operations. On the innovation front, we continue to introduce exciting new solutions that bring together services, software and hardware capabilities in a way that only HPE can. For example, in December, we launched HPE GreenLake, a suite of pay-per-use solutions available for top customer workloads. Essentially, HPE GreenLake offer customers choice in where workloads and how to flexibly consume them. The offerings include Big Data, backup, open database, SAP HANA and Edge computing. Also in December, we launched HPE OneSphere, a software management platform that lets customer deploy, operate and optimize on-premise private cloud environment and put the cloud capabilities through a simple unified experience. I believe that no one else in the market can match the platform we have created. In November, we announced the world's most scalable and modular in-memory computing platform, called HPE Superdrome Flex. The platform enables enterprise of any size to process and analyze massive amount of data and turn it into real time business insights. And we announced an innovative blockchain-as-a-service solution. Enterprises are finding that the generic infrastructure in public cloud environments can now support the blockchain requirements that they need in terms of performance, security, scalability and resiliency. Our solution brings an enterprise grade capability to blockchain workloads. I believe our portfolio is the strongest we have had in years, and customers are thinking of this. For example, just this week, we announced a $57 million win with the Department of Defense for supercomputers that it plans to use for tasks like designing helicopters and weather forecasting. Eni, the multinational oil and gas company, recently announced the industry's most powerful supercomputer, the HPC4 based on HPE's ProLiant servers. And as some of you know, I am a big soccer fan, so lot of that HPE's network and storage solutions are enabling Ajax, a professional football club in the Netherland, to analyze player performance in real time through artificial intelligence. So overall, the year is off to a slow start. I believe Q1 is a solid proof point that shows we are doing the right things. But there's still more work to do. We remain focused on executing our strategy, driving HPE Next and continue to introduce innovative products and services our customers are looking for. As long as we sustain that approach, I am confident we will continue to deliver solid financial results and shareholder returns. And now, let me hand the call over to Tim who will provide additional details on the quarter. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks, Antonio. Q1 was a good start to the year with accelerated revenue growth, solid operating margins and better than expected earnings. Our results give me confidence that we\u2019ve been making the right moves with our go-to-market changes, operational refinements and cost cutting actions to deliver strong shareholders value. Total revenue for the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 11% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. As Antonio discussed, top line performance was driven by combination of good execution, improving market dynamics, a strong backlog entering the quarter and favorable year-over-year compares. From a macro prospective, we continue to see a broadly improving IT spend environment from improved customer demand and higher AUPs. Competitive pricing and commodities remain significant year-over-year headwinds, but we did make encouraging traction regaining some of the ground we lost last year. Exchange rates from favorably throughout the quarter leading to a 180 basis point tailwind to revenue year-over-year. If current rates hold, we now expect currency to be a 3 point benefit to revenue in fiscal year '18 versus the prior year. By region, HPE\u2019s performance in the Americas continue to improve, growing 3% with strength in core compute and campus switching combined with a recovery in the organic storage results. Revenue in Europe was even stronger, up 11% in constant currency, driven by an acceleration in core compute and storage with double-digit growth in Germany and Scandinavia. Asia-Pacific grew almost 20% in constant currency, delivering solid core server revenue with double-digit growth in Japan China and Australia. Turning to margins. The gross margin of 28.4% was down 370 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 7.7% was down 180 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points sequentially. We executed well this quarter and we're able to accelerate some incremental cost savings from HPE Next, but still have more work to do driving key improvements later in the year. We also delivered some additional operating leverage in Q1 associated with the strong revenue growth. These two items help offset normal seasonality, as well as those large year-over-year impact from DRAM, which didn\u2019t spike until late January last year. We're still seeing some sequential increases but they are moderating, the pricing environment remains challenging but is showing signs of improvement with more ability of pass cost increases through to customers. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 is considerably above our previous outlook of $0.20 to $0.24 due to a few factors. First, we benefited by approximately $0.03 from a lower tax rate associated with tax reform that we will discuss in more detail shortly. Second, our other income expense was about $0.04 better than expected, primarily due to foreign exchange favorability related to our balance sheet hedging program. The remainder of the out-performance by driven by the strong revenue growth and acceleration of some HPE Next cost savings. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes pre-tax amounts for tax indemnification adjustments of $919 million, transformation and restructuring charges of $248 million and amortization of intangible assets of $78 million, offset by income tax adjustments, including tax reform of $2.2 billion. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.89 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.01 to $0.05 due primarily to non-cash income tax benefit associated with tax reform and adjustments to prior valuation allowances from our fiscal year '17 separation activities. Before I discuss some results by business, I wanted to remind everyone that we\u2019ll be reporting fiscal year '18 results in three primary segments; Hybrid IT, which includes compute, storage, datacenter networking and Pointnext; Intelligent Edge, which includes campus and branch switching, wireless LAN, Edge compute and Aruba services; and lastly, financial services. This new structure more accurately reflects how we go-to-market and manage the business internally. Besides modifying the reported segments, we also transferred costs including stock compensation expense from corporate investments and corporate unallocated and to the other reported business segments to better align reporting with how the businesses are evaluated for performance. Hopefully, you saw the 8-K we filed last week, which included reconciliation tables to restate fiscal year '16 and fiscal year '17 results into the new reporting structure. Now turning to the results by business. In hybrid IT, revenue was up 10% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency with growth across all businesses and all regions. Operating margins were down 310 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially to 9.6% in line with our expectations. The sequential margin decline is a result of normal seasonality offset by HPE Next cost savings and operating leverage from revenue growth. Compute revenue was up 11% year-over-year and 14% excluding Tier 1. We executed well on our core server business, driving 16% growth as richer attach configurations and elevated commodity costs continue to drive AUPs higher. We saw continued momentum in our value businesses with high performance compute growing low double-digits and synergy up over 40% sequentially. Growth in hyper converged with SimpliVity continued at over 200% year-over-year. Storage revenue was up 24%, driven by the Nimble acquisition and strong recovery in the organic business, which grew 11%. 3PAR returned to growth driven by significantly improved performance in the Americas as we saw the benefit from the go-to-market and leadership changes we made last quarter. We also saw strong double-digit growth in Big Data storage, which has been a growth driver over the last five quarters. All-flash arrays grew 16% year-over-year. We also expect to take back some share in total external disk. Datacenter networking revenue was up 27% and continues to reform very well with good sales execution. Pointnext revenue was up 2% with operational growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Overall, orders were flat as growth in our attach business, driven by higher services intensity more than offset hardware unit declines. However, our install base orders were down due to push out of a few deals into the next quarter that have since closed and some weakness in renewals from ongoing declines in legacy business. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 9% year-over-year and 7% in constant currency. Operating margins were up 10 basis points year-over-year and down 960 basis points sequentially to 2.9%. While the rate was impacted by lower wireless sales in Q1, we\u2019re also managing the business for accelerated growth and share gains. Aligned to our strategy of pivoting to the Intelligent Edge, we have been making significant R&D and go-to-market investments that have given us a leadership position in this high growth market opportunity. Aruba product grew 9% with strong growth in campus switching that continues to benefit from pull-through with the Aruba acquisition. Wireless LAN results were disappointing due to a slow start and a tough compare given the major wins in the first quarter of fiscal year '17. However, we have a strong pipeline and are confident revenue will rebound quickly. Aruba services was up 6% as we continue to improve services attached with the goal of driving rates closer to those in Pointnext. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 8% year-over-year and 5% in constant-currency, driven by strong residual sales and improving direct business. Financing volume was up 7% as solid growth in our direct business was offset somewhat by declines in our indirect business. Operating profit declined 110 basis points year-over-year to 8.1% due to an unfavorable compare with the bad debt reserve release in the prior year period. Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow was negative $412 million and in line with expectations. The cash conversion cycle increased six days sequentially to negative 21 days, driven primarily by purchasing linearity. We returned $862 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $120 million of dividend payments and $742 million of share repurchases. We also ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $4.3 billion. Before I move to the outlook, I wanted to provide some more details on how tax reform will impact HPE and the updates to our capital strategy that Antonio previously mentioned. Overall, the recently cash tax reform makes us more competitive with foreign peers and provides greater cash management flexibility. As you saw this quarter, we had several GAAP only non-cash items related to tax reform, which included adjustments to deferred tax assets and liability plus transition tax expense that we expect to offset with tax attributes. From a non-GAAP perspective, given that our fiscal year '18 began before the end of the calendar year, we're not subject to the new foreign minimum tax for fiscal year '18. Therefore, we expect our fiscal year '18 tax rate to be 11% to 15%. Beginning in fiscal year '19, we will be subject to the foreign minimum tax and expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be 16% to 20%. Tax reform has also given us increased access to our cash balances offshore, enabling more financial flexibility. As Antonio discussed, we plan to deploy our excess cash and expect to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends between fiscal year '18 and fiscal year '19. This will include a 50% increase in our quarterly dividend to $11.25 per share, starting in Q3 of this year from our current $0.750, as well as share repurchases of over $5.5 billion by the end of fiscal year '19. The buyback will be more weighted to fiscal year '18 but we will repurchase shares in an efficient manner so that timing may not be linear. As always, we will continue to use our ROI based capital allocation framework. While this is currently biased to capital returns, retaining our existing investment grade credit rating is important and we'll also continue to take a disciplined approach to M&A. Now turning to our outlook. We're increasing our non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal year '18 by $0.20 based on several factors. First, we'll see a significant benefit from a lower tax rate associated with tax reform. Second, given the Q1 benefit from our balance sheet hedging program and ongoing drop in hedge costs due to rising U.S. interest rates, we now expect OID to be only $200 million expense in fiscal year '18 versus $300 million previously guided at our Analyst Day. Third, we expect some minor benefit for incremental share repurchases that will likely be done towards the end of the year. Lastly, we are passing through the operational outperformance in Q1 that will be somewhat offset by the incremental investments in our employees that Antonio mentioned. As a result, we expect fiscal year '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.35 to $1.45 and we also expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.35 to $1.45. For Q2 '18, we expect non GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.29 to $0.33 and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.10 to $0.14. We also continue to expect free cash flow of approximately $1 billion in fiscal year '18. So overall, like Antonio, I'm very pleased with performance this quarter, and I'm looking forward to executing the remainder of the year. So with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Congrats on a great quarter. The guidance implies that you don\u2019t think the strength in server and storage or the upside in server and storage that you saw this quarter continues into future quarters. So I just wonder whether you can comment on whether there were some onetime benefits from the manufacturing transition, catch up in execution around the storage sales force. What are some of the one-time benefits that you think helped in fiscal 1Q and that suggest to you that strength won\u2019t necessarily continue later into the year? And then I have a follow up. Tim Stonesifer : Let me start off and then I\u2019ll pass it over to Antonio. So if you look at that 11% growth, I would say 4 points of that is related to foreign exchange and acquisitions, and the timing of the acquisition if you think about Nimble and SimpliVity. There\u2019s probably about - although this is always hard to measure, 4 to 5 points of better market and backlog, we did go into Q1 with a stronger backlog than what we typically have. And then I\u2019d say there\u2019s probably 2 to 3 points that\u2019s related to execution. So those are the drivers for Q1. As you think about the total year, I just ask you to think about two things. First of all, particularly in the back half of the year as you recall last year, we had a big ramp in revenue in the back half of '17. So as we get into \u201918, that\u2019s going to be a tough compare. And then the other thing to take into account is backlogs will normalize and as they return to more normalized levels that will have an impact as well. Antonio Neri : I will just only add that as we progress throughout the year, obviously the AUPs will be more normalized because of the DRAM cost and the pricing they\u2019re going to be more in line compared to the Q1, because the Q1 last year was DRAM had no impact to pricing. So that\u2019s one of factors we need to consider in. But as Tim said, obviously we have a tougher compare but our focus is really on the volume to value to growth execution. On the volume side of the equation, we continue to focus on profitable share and obviously improve that cost structure. And on the value on the pockets of growth we discussed before, particularly around hyper converged high performance compute and ramp of synergy. Katy Huberty : And then just as a follow up when you consider the $7 billion of capital return, how do you think about that in terms of whether it limits you from doing multibillion dollar M&A deals or are you willing to take the business into a net debt position if the right deal comes along. Antonio Neri : I'm very committed to apply the same rigorous disciplined ROI based approach that Meg laid out in her tenure here. And obviously right now we are obviously biased to share repurchases and increase in dividends. We talked about M&A before, but our right to emphasize our focus on innovation. Innovation is three step approach; one is our organic innovation where we obviously want to invest our own dollars there; second is through the partnerships and the focus on emerging technologies where we can invest small amount of dollars in this disrupting technologies and companies that we can bring in our ecosystems and shine them through our solutions in the go-to-market we have; and then last but not least is the M&A, if there is an opportunity with the right valuation, the right appeal, the right talent, we will obviously consider it. But I think we have enough flexibility in our financials to go do that. And let's remind ourselves when we talk about what the acquisition looks like, the Aruba likes or even smaller than that. So that's our focus. But right now, we are really committed to that ROI based capital allocation. Operator : The next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I just wanted to clarify your guidance raise, so you beat by $0.12 this quarter. The lower tax rate should add $0.10 and the lower I&E -- and that's $0.10 starting in Q2 and not counting the lower tax rate in Q1, so I\u2019m not double counting. And then the better than previously guided OI&E would add $0.05. So just those three factors alone would add $0.27 to your EPS and yet you\u2019re raising your guidance by $0.20. Should we be reading into that that you are making incremental investments or that\u2019s something as weaker than you had expected? Tim Stonesifer : You had me up until $0.27, so let me just take you through how we think about it. You are right, the tax rate think about the $0.03 benefit that we had in Q1 that should carry forward, so call that $0.12. The OI&E benefit is roughly $0.04. If you think about what the incremental share buybacks, those will probably be backend loaded given the fact that we are already front end loaded our previous commitment, so that maybe a penny or two. And then we\u2019re flowing through the Q1 operational improvement of $0.04 to $0.05 with the exception of the fact that we did accelerate or see some accelerated savings from HPE Next and then obviously we need to fund the investments in the 401(k) and the employee programs that Antonio spoke about. So that's how I think about the $0.20 raise, which we think is prudent at this point in time. Toni Sacconaghi : And then can you comment on what your outlook for free cash flow is for the year? I think your previous guidance have been $1 billion, I'm not sure if I missed it or whether you've reaffirmed that? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, we did reaffirm the $1 billion, again, if you think about the $0.20 increase that I just walked through, more than half of that is tax driven. And as you know our cash tax rate is lower than our effective tax rate even with the revision will be still in that same range from a cash tax perspective, so no real benefit there. We should see some upside in the OI&E and the operational performance. But given the fact that it's only Q1 and that there is still a lot of work to do, we felt it was prudent to stick with the approximately $1 billion that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting. Operator : The next question will be from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : You guys saw very strong growth this quarter and clearly you benefitted from an easy compare versus last year. I think at your Analyst Day you\u2019d guided to growth this year. I guess I am trying to understand how you think about growth as we move through the year? And I think you\u2019d commented that your long term growth outlook for the business is something like 0% to 1%. Is that still the right way to think about your opportunity to seek growth for the business? Antonio Neri : So we obviously are committed to the financial architecture we laid out in October at the Security Analyst Meeting. Again, let's go back to the Q1 growth. Again, a lot of that was obviously the AUP increases we see, we saw in the market because of the pricing increasing, but also strong execution. I think when I think about the Q1 results is a proof point of we have the right strategy and focus. I think we have to see what the pricing environment is going to do. But overall, I think our focus is really to pivot the portfolio from the volume side of the house to the value side of the house, which obviously the growth rates are different. But as we look through the year, we're got to lap bigger numbers. And as I said earlier, the AUPs are going to be more in line to the cost increases we saw last year. So we don't expect that lift in the pricing we saw at the beginning of this year. Sherri Scribner : And then maybe a question for Tim, thinking about the margins, you guys beat a little bit on operating margin line this quarter, but you maintained the full year outlook for operating margins of 9.5%. How should we think about margins trending as we move through the year? I assume this quarter is going to be the low point. Tim Stonesifer : This quarter will be the low point as we talked about it. We did see a little bit of favorability. Again, we had some benefits that we pulled forward on the HPE Next savings. But our plan is going to be back half loaded. And the reason that is, is because if you think about HPE Next, we're being very thoughtful and deliberate as to how we execute those simplification actions because we want to minimize the business disruption. I think Q1 in the revenue performance we saw there was a good proof point. Secondly, the recent acquisitions we've done, those become more accretive throughout the course of the year as we continue to grow those businesses and right-size the cost envelopes. And then we should see a mix split. And as we continue to grow the higher margin parts of the portfolio, whether it\u2019d be hyper converge, all flash array, et cetera, we should get a natural mix of it. So Q1 will be a low point and then we'll continue to expand margins throughout the course of the year. Operator : The next question will be from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : In your prepared comments, you talked about strengthening sales, which of course is helped by easier costs, then you also commented on strong margins. But when we look at the margins, if my math is right, it looks like they actually declined like a 180 basis points and it was across most of your segments, yet sales did increase a lot. So can you help us bridge the gap, I am sure memory prices are large part of it, or is it all the part, help us bridge the gap about why you didn't see some positive margin run rates despite the sales increase year-over-year? Tim Stonesifer : I am not sure we said strong margin, we saw a strong revenue performance. To your point, we did see margin pressure and that's primarily driven by DRAM. So again, if you think about it, in Q1 of '18, we have a full quarter of elevated DRAM costs because those costs do not spike until January of \u201917, so that\u2019s a pressure point. We are also seeing a little bit of mix pressure in Q1 given the strong performance in high performance compute, so that obviously has a lower margin as compared to Edge and Pointnext, and that\u2019s been offset by some of the cost savings. So we are seeing margins pressure to your point. But again, margins will expand throughout the course of the year. Jim Suva : And then as my follow up, it seems like the DRAM memory cost would impact, if I am correct, both Hybrid IT and Intelligent Edge segments, if you can clarify that. But I struggle about why would financial services be down, property margin so much despite their revenue growth. Tim Stonesifer : So the operating margins and financial services that\u2019s primarily driven by a onetime bad debt reserve benefit that we had in Q1 of \u201917 that doesn\u2019t repeat in Q1 of '18. Antonio Neri : And I will say on the DRAM since you have the part of the question there, is actually everything is in Hybrid IT. There is very little that impacts the compute Edge. But I will say the most if not all of that is in the Hybrid IT. Operator : The next question will be from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead. Steve Milunovich : Could you remind us about the cost savings from the HPE Next program this year and going forward, and how much you pulled into the first quarter relative to your expectations? Tim Stonesifer : For 2018, we have about $250 million of net cost savings related to HPE Next. I would say probably a third of that is front end loaded in the first half and then the remainder is back end loaded. And then for the total program, because again this is a three year program, we should net about $750 million to $800 million of net cost savings. Steve Milunovich : And as you go through the share repurchase and dividend increase, where do you expect to come out in terms of net cash position. Are you going to be in a cash position or there will be net debt on the core business? Tim Stonesifer : So for this year, we will end up in a net cash position, over the long-term, if you think about '19 and beyond. Again, from a net cash position, we should be neutral, may be a little bit positive, but it will take us some time to work through that. Operator : The next question will be from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : I wanted ask about linearity, and see if you could comment a little bit on the backlog existing the quarter, given you came into the quarter with high backlog. Did you exit with high backlog as well? And then I have a follow up. Antonio Neri : I think we had strong execution. We continue to build a strong momentum and pipeline, and we exit slightly above where we normally expect by the end of the quarter. So we feel good about how we exited and most importantly about our pipeline. Rod Hall : And then I wanted to just ask a broader question. Did you see acceleration at the end of the quarter after the tax bill passed? And do you believe that your customers have fully reacted to the tax saves, or do you think people are still out there planning what they might be able to spend as they go forward? Antonio Neri : Well, I think it\u2019s too early to say or to call it. I will say our Q1 performance was steady, was consistent throughout the quarter, except the wireless comment we made earlier where we said the slow we\u2019ll finish strong. But in Hybrid IT, it was very consistent across all the businesses. And part of that is because obviously we have phenomenal innovation that customers are liking. Last week, I was actually in UK and hosted a Board of Advisor where we bring our key strategic customers to talk about vision, our strategy, get their inputs about the future. And they all made the same comment. We love your innovation. We need you to continue to position that innovation against our problems, and to see the value there. So we never have the position we have today in terms of portfolio and with the simplification of sales, remember we eliminated the regional layers, we eliminated people in the middle between me and the country. Actually, we believe that's helping us so the right the execution we talked early on. Operator : The next questioner will be Shannon Cross at Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Antonio, can you speak a bit about what you've learned from HPE Next, because it's going through the business and the model. I'm curious as to response from your employees, currently it\u2019s not really impacting front facing employees because the revenue is coming through. But I'm curious is it in line with your expectations, are you finding more areas to cut overtime? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Antonio Neri : So first of all, let me remind what the HPE Next is all about. So HPE Next is initiative and launch, which I architected last year around the summer, and it's all about simplification, innovation and execution. And I have to say, I'm pleased with the first quarter performance where we executed well with no disruption. But this is an opportunity for me as the new CEO to establish a new culture as we transform the company, and to really architect the company from the grounds up with a clean sheet approach. And this is going to change the culture of the company. What I learned is the fact that you can push more, you can do more. And the organization is actually very excited about what we\u2019re doing, because this is an opportunity to improve the way serve our customers. So it is very critical initiative for us and we are confident we\u2019re going to deliver not only the improvements in our cost savings but also the way we work and employee productivity. And most importantly that should reflect in our business performance and our customer satisfaction. Shannon Cross : And then can you provide more details about the incremental investments you\u2019re making in your employees that you talked about with regard to the tax reform? Maybe some more specifics on what you are going to be investing. Thank you. Antonio Neri : So in my prepared remarks and as Tim said, we are investing in two specific areas. One is in the 401(k) matching contribution. So we\u2019re raising that significantly. And we believe that's a more structural approach that will benefit our employees versus paying a one-time bonus I think that's a long-term benefit for our employees. And second is we live in the market that moves so rapidly and the need to risking our workforce has never been higher. So the ability to provide assistance learning to whatever degrees we want to put our employees through it is I think is a great investment for the future of the company and our employees. So they can fulfill their visions in our company as they progress with the carrier. Operator : The next question will be from Lou Miscioscia of Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Lou Miscioscia : Can you go into little bit more detail on the storage side. It just seems that 3PAR bounce back so much faster than we had expected, and then also maybe just tie into that, what are you seeing on a quarter-to-quarter basis for pricing for DRAM and NAND? Antonio Neri : This was a good quarter for us, in storage. We grew the business 24% year-over-year and in that obviously have the Nimble numbers. But as Tim and I stated in our prepared remarks, our organic storage grew 11%. And as we talked in the previous two calls, we talked about some of the execution challenges we had in our go to market, particularly in United States. And one of the comments we made in one of the calls is that we brought together the storage sales force from Nimble and 3PAR together under the leadership of an individual, called Keegan Riley, which has tremendous expertise. And we see now the benefits of that. When you go out to the market with a clear value proposition and a differentiated offering, it starts paying off. So this was all about focus and execution. However, at the same time, we continue to bring great innovation. And so starting this quarter, we brought out the HPE InfoSight that came with the Nimble acquisition. And now we -- and as you know, InfoSight these days what we call AI or the autonomous technologies in the datacenter with predictive and preventative technologies and algorithms, now we made that available to the entire converged storage portfolio for Nimble, 3PAR and all-flash. So we believe we have a differentiated offering. We have a very focused sales force and we have a value proposition that I think customers are liking it. Lou Miscioscia : I think maybe you want to hit on the DRAM question? Antonio Neri : Yes, so on the DRAM question, we continue to see some nominal increases in DRAM, but these are low single digits cost increases. Starting this quarter, we have done a better job passing those increases to our pricing. And as the competitive market normalizes a little bit and become most rational, we are able to pass those it through. As I think about the remainder of 2018, we will continue to see some nominal increases but not obviously at the elevated levels we saw last year. And then we see what incremental supply will be available. As you know, there're transitions from 2D to 3D and new fabs that will be coming online, but it's all to be seen. So we factor in our plans the elevated DRAM for the remainder of the year. Operator : The next question will be from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Antonio and Tim, I guess just circling back to the potential for long term growth in the context of -- with the same guide was the 0% to 1%. I believe that what had been the headwind businesses, which were your Microsoft Tier 1 business and Unix have now bottomed out. And please correct me if that\u2019s inaccurate. But if it is accurate, particularly what feels like a secular mix shift up in the Window's Server business. What would be the reason that you wouldn't be able to now grow greater than that longer term, and maybe even some meaningful basis points, hundreds of basis points greater than that given that you\u2019re pretty well positioned now in markets that are growing, and you've gotten some really good traction? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Let me answer first the Tier 1 question. As we stated, we are totally deemphasizing the focus on what we call the customized commoditized compute platforms. That does not mean that we're going to continue to sell the rest of the portfolio to those in large customers, because those are customers who buy everything, not just that type of platform with commoditization. So we are executing that strategy and we remain committed to that strategy, which obviously is a headwind because as you know the business was at a peak between 15% and 20% of our numbers. So that\u2019s point number one. Point number two as I said earlier right, as we see the first half versus the second half, you see the inflated AUPs in terms of compares. As you go to the second half, that\u2019s not going to be the case. And also we had -- remember we had Nimble, now in the second half fully baked in our results of 2017 second half. And so that compare will be harder. That said listen I am optimistic and confident about our ability to compete and win in the areas we decided to pay focus and attention. For example, high performance compute, hyper converge, synergy, which has been a great success for us. But remember it\u2019s two place two rolls, one is what we call place only better and the other one is the composable infrastructure, which allows us to bring that public cloud experience on premises. And then we expect to see solid continued performance in storage. So I think the mix will play huge role here as we go along the way, but that\u2019s why at this point in time, we are little bit more cautious about that. Ananda Baruah : I got it, that\u2019s really helpful. It seems like you\u2019re well set up that being said, relative to the model. I really appreciate, that\u2019s it for me. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question will be from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Just a clarification, on your pull forward of HPE Next. Is that just pull forward within the cost savings that you alluded that you would accomplish this year, or is the entire plan just tracking ahead and you can accomplish the entire HPE Next on a faster timeline? Antonio Neri : That was really more of a Q2, Q3 into Q1. Again, we're early on an HPE Next. We\u2019re pleased with the progress, the teams are making tremendous progress but it\u2019s still early in that to say it will from Q2 or Q3. Wamsi Mohan : And then just as a follow up. Could you give us some sense? I mean, Antonio, you mentioned this a few times about server configurations being busier, your mix HPC benefiting mix as well. Could you give us some sense of how server units trended on a year-over-year basis, just on to your ex-Tier 1? Antonio Neri : These configurations gets smarter and bigger. Just to give you an example, our standard pro LAN server now, which is industry leading virtualized platform, called the Pro LAN 380. You can actually configure all the way up to half petabyte in various small factor. So those are massive technological advancement, both from the commodity perspective, from the system design perspective. And so customers are buying more rich configurations, because they were low on that also is a question of economics in term of power consumption and performance. So that\u2019s what aspect. In terms of what we expect for units, listen the vast majority of the unit growth has been in there what we call the hyper scalar, but we see growth obviously in HPC. These are very large cluster configurations. But at the same time, we see the growth in value normalized with the decline in enterprise, so it\u2019s hard to give you a number, is going to come down to the mix. We believe the value units will continue to grow and the volume side of house will be a decline. And then ultimate is going to be mass exercise. But again let me emphasize where our focus is, our focus is profitable share growth. Operator : And that question will be from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : I guess mainly to start on the compute side. Could you just talk about the 10% growth how much of that is units versus ASP for you guys. And broadly how do you think of the server market through fiscal '18? And is there a potential for a bigger refresh in the back half given all the security issues? Antonio Neri : I will say the vast majority growth has been AUP driven. And I just I think provided some insight in the previous question where we expect some growth in units. But again, it's just the size deal that and a mix view of that. I think in terms of refresh, we\u2019re still early in what we call the Skylake refresh that refresh has not been different in any other transition we have seen in the past, whether this spectra and meltdown issues, which are an industry wide issue. Right now, we don\u2019t see any slowdown or any increase in demand. But as I think about the future and think about the performance impact to some of these patches could have on specific workloads, customer will have to think about how to cover that incremental capacity. And we at HPE have already made available services offerings. So from the service perspective, we can help customers manage, those are patches and upgrades and also product upgrades modernization type of programs, as well as consumption based models with HPE GreenLake. So they can -- let's say, they need a 10% more capacity, we can offer that 10% on their premises and stay as you go. And so all those programs have been rolled out to our field and to our channel partners and we\u2019re going to monitor that as we go along. Amit Daryanani : If I can just follow-up quickly on the tax rate dynamic that you talked about. I'm curious is there any change to you cash tax rate at all in fiscal '18 or in fiscal '19. I realized what's happening on the P&L. But on the cash tax rate, does that change over the next few years? Tim Stonesifer : No, it doesn\u2019t really change over the next few years. But longer term, our cash tax rate will probably be more closer to our effective tax rate. Andrew Simanek : Great, thank you, Amit. And I think with that, we can close down the call. Thanks everyone for joining us today. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your line.",

Shannon Cross - Cross Research Jim Suva - Citigroup Steven Milunovich - UBS Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Aaron Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities Operator : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Hewlett Packard Enterprise Earnings Conference Call. My name is William, and I will be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andrew Simanek : Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I\u2019d like to welcome you to our fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tim Stonesifer, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations webpage at investors.hpe.com.

HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2018. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that I\u2019m very pleased with our strong performance in Q2. We continue to execute well across all business segments while delivering on a number of strategic initiatives. Revenue of $7.5 billion, was up 10% from the prior year period. We experienced solid revenue growth across each business segment with particular strength in Intelligent Edge, High-Performance Compute, Storage, Hyper Converged and Composable Infrastructure. From a macro perspective, the IT market remains robust. We saw growth in all regions with particular strength in both EMEA and APJ. Currency was a larger year-over-year benefit, providing a 3 point tailwind this quarter. Given our strong execution helped by $0.01 tax benefit, we delivered a non-GAAP EPS of $0.34, above our outlook range of $0.29 to $0.33. Looking at cash flow. Our free cash flow was negative $269 million in Q2. We remain confident in our full-year outlook of approximately $1 billion in free cash flow. Tim will provide more color on this in a moment. Finally, in Q2, we began executing against our $7 billion capital return plan we announced last quarter. We returned $1 billion to shareholders in form of share repurchases and dividends, and we announced that we are raising our dividend by approximately 50% starting in the current third quarter. Looking forward, as a result of our outperformance in Q2, as well as a continued benefits from a lower tax rate, we are raising our fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP EPS outlook to $1.40 to $1.50 from our previously provided outlook of $1.35 to $1.45. Tim will provide more details in a minute. Before I turn to the business segment\u2019s performance, I want to give you an update on our progress with HPE Next. As a reminder, HPE Next is a companywide initiative to re-architect HPE to deliver on our strategy and drive new wave of shareholder value. It is all about simplification, execution and innovation. Through this initiative, we are simplifying our operating model in the way we work. We\u2019re streamlining our offerings and business processes and modernizing our IT systems to improve our execution. And we\u2019re shifting our investments in innovation towards high-growth and higher-margin opportunities. Over the first-half of this year, we have achieved some significant milestones across each of these areas. For example, we have reduced bands and layers between the CEO and the customer. We have significant streamlined our sales structure, empowering the front line to make key decisions, and we have dramatically reduced SKUs and platforms across our volume and value segments, which simplifies our operation and makes us easier to work with. Looking into the second-half of the year, we\u2019ll be concentrating our efforts on the next phase of the initiative, including building out our no-touch sales model for certain [indiscernible] segments and accelerating our IT transformation to better service customers and partners. The changes we are making through HPE Next, will not only improve our cost structure, we will also give us a significant long-term competitive advantage. I\u2019m very proud of the work we are doing here. And while the decisions we are making are for the long-term, you are really beginning to see the benefits in our financial results. In Q2, we delivered an operating margin of 8.6%, up 270 basis points from last year due in part to the effective execution of HPE Next. Turning to our business segments, we saw solid performance across the Board, while continuing to deliver innovation in key areas of our portfolio. In Intelligent Edge segment, revenue grew 17% year-over-year with strength in both product and services. Q2 wireless LAN revenue rebounded as expected after a softer Q1 and wire switching remains strong. And while still a small portion of our overall products sales, we saw strong customer traction with our Edgeline IoT Systems, including a significant win with a global financial services company. These results bode well for our future. Our customers tell us they want to take advantage of exploding amount of the useful data being created at the edge. We hear them and we continue to make investments to build out our Intelligent Edge portfolio. For example, in Q2, we strengthened our portfolio with the acquisition of Cape Networks. The Cape acquisition is the latest steps towards our vision of autonomous infrastructure enabled by artificial intelligence. Cape expands Aruba AI powered networking capabilities with a sensor-based network assurance solution that improves network performance, reduces disruptions and significantly simplifies IT management for our customers. We also introduced NetInsight, another complementary AI-based analytics and assurance solution for optimizing network performance. NetInsight uses machine learning to continuously monitor the network and deliver insights in the event of anomalies. It also recommends how best to optimize the network from today\u2019s mobile-first employees and workplace critical IoT devices. Looking forward, we see significant potential in Intelligent Edge and this will continue to be a key area of investment for us. Turning to Hybrid IT, revenue was $6 billion, up 7% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. Compute grew 6% year-over-year and 9% if you exclude Tier 1. We saw very strong growth in high-performance compute, composable infrastructure and hyper converged, offset by the continued decline in our customized commodity server sales to Tier 1 vendors, a business we are moving away from. Our focus continued to be on providing solutions that deliver high value differentiation to our customers and drive profitable share for HPE. And we continue to prioritize investment in those higher-margin, high-growth segments of the market. For example, just last week, we announced the acquisition of Plexxi. Plexxi provides innovative software-defined networking technology, which we plan to integrate into both SimpliVity, our hyper-converged offering, and Synergy, our composable infrastructure offering. With Plexxi, we will enable customers to move and manage their data more quickly and effectively and also significantly reduce CapEx and OpEx by up to 50% in some cases. Storage performed very well, up 24% year-over-year with the Nimble acquisition and up 14% organically. All-flash continue to perform well growing 20% year-over-year, as the market continues to transition and we benefit from our strong position with both 3PAR and Nimble. And earlier this month, we introduced the next generation Nimble Storage platform, which is backed by guaranteed to deliver the best storage efficiency of any all-flash array on the market. Data center networking revenue was up 2% year-over-year with good execution within our existing installed base. Finally, turning to services. HPE Pointnext revenue grew 1% year-over-year in Q2. We saw a pickup in orders from deals that slipped from Q1 and strong customer traction from our newest offering called HPE GreenLake. HPE GreenLake is a suite of pay-per-use solutions available for top customers\u2019 workloads like Big Data, SAP HANA and Edge computing. The offering simplifies the IT experience and gives customers choice in where workload should live and how to flexibly consume them. This is an offering we will continue to expand, look for updates soon. And in Q2, we also continue to strengthen our advisory capabilities building on our acquisition of cloud technology partners with the acquisition of RedPixie. RedPixie is a UK-based cloud consulting company with deep Microsoft Azure expertise, which perfectly complements CTPs strong AWS relationship. We are excited about the capabilities these two acquisitions bring to HPE and are already seeing them open doors to new and bigger deals. HPE Financial Services also performed well in the quarter with revenue up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our asset management business. Customers are responding well to the actions we are taking both from an operational and innovation perspective. They believe in our strategy and the powerful portfolio of products and services we are building, and that confidence can be seen in some recent wins. For example, in Q2, we won a major high-performance compute deal with the U.S. Department of Energy. This is just the latest example of the strength of HPE\u2019s HPC portfolio and the value it brings to the U.S. government and the nation in international competition over computing power. We also won a new project with Time Warner, where Aruba was selected for the state-of-the-art Hudson Yards Smart Digital Workplace project in New York City. And we announced a new supercomputer installation of KU Leuven, a Flemish research university, consistently ranked as one of the top five most innovative universities in the world. We have collaborated with the university to develop and deploy a new supercomputer specifically built to run AI workloads. It will be used to build applications that drive scientific breakthroughs, economic growth, and innovation in Belgium. And next month, we will host our Annual HP Discover Conference in Las Vegas, bringing together thousands of customers and partners from around the world. We will be making some exciting announcement at the event and I look forward to see many of you there. So, as I said earlier, I\u2019m very pleased with our performance in the first-half of fiscal year 2018. All of our business segments performed well. We made solid progress on HPE Next and continue to invest in innovation that will furthest strengthen and differentiate our company into the future. Looking ahead to the rest of the year, as we indicated last quarter, we expect the growth rate to moderate given tougher compares, lapping acquisitions and a smaller currency tailwind. While we see a more challenging second-half, we have got great momentum and I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll deliver on our annual fiscal year 2018 outlook. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks, Antonio. Our Q2 financial results were strong, with robust revenue growth, significantly improved operating margins and better than expected earnings. Total revenue for the quarter was $7.5 billion, up 10% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency. Top line performance was driven by good market dynamics, solid execution and both favorable year-over-year compares and exchange rates. From a portfolio mix perspective, we\u2019re seeing solid growth in our value offerings and our core volume business is growing better than expected. From a macro perspective, IT spending continues to be quite healthy with solid customer demand across all businesses and geographies. The pricing environment remains competitive, but has continued to be more rational and passing through elevated commodities costs. DRAM cost increases have also started to flatten. Currency drove a 330 basis point tailwind in revenue year-over-year. With that said, rates have moved somewhat unfavorably in the last month, so currency will not be as large of a benefit in the second-half, if these rates hold. We now expect closer to a two point benefit to revenue in fiscal year 2018. Regionally, HPE\u2019s performance in the Americas continue to be solid, growing 3% in constant currency. Most of the growth came from the U.S., Canada and Brazil with strength in storage and the Intelligent Edge. Revenue growth in Europe continue to be strong, up 9% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in UK, France and Italy. Performance in EMEA was strong across all business units with double-digit growth in compute, storage and Aruba Products and Services. Asia Pacific grew 9% in constant currency, with strong growth in China, Australia and Singapore. Turning to margins. The gross margin of 30.4% was up 90 basis points year-over-year and 200 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.6%, was up 270 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. We continue to execute well this quarter with HPE Next savings driving most of the improvement. DRAM was also less of a pressure point as compared to prior quarters and we continue to gain traction on the pricing front. Going forward, margin improvement will be driven primarily by delivering the cost savings from HPE Next and growing our value portfolio offerings, which have higher margins. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 is just above the high-end of our previous outlook of $0.29 to $0.33 due to strong operational performance and a tax rate benefit of approximately a $0.01. The Q2 non-GAAP tax rate was 9.6%, which is just below our previously provided tax range of a 11% to 15%, due to various one-time reductions in non-U.S. tax expense. For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to be at the lower-end of the 11% to 15% range, but we\u2019re still working through many variables associated with tax reform. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.49, above our previously provided outlook range of $0.10 to $0.14, primarily due to releasing reserves we\u2019ve been holding associated with HPQ tax risks that were part of our separation agreement, which has now been settled. Now turning to the business units. In Hybrid IT, revenue was up 7% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. Revenue performance was strong and balanced across all businesses in all regions. Operating margins were 10.3%, up 220 basis points year-over-year and 70 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations. Compute revenue was up 6% year-over-year and 9% excluding Tier 1. We continue to see higher AUPs, driven by passing through more DRAM costs, increasing our gen 10 mix and delivering richer attach configurations. We saw continued momentum in our value business with high-performance compute growing over 20%, hyper converged up triple digits, and synergy gaining increasing customer traction. As mentioned earlier, revenue growth in our volume business was higher than planned, driven by strong growth in core rack. Storage revenue was up 24% year-over-year with continued momentum in the organic business, up 14% year-over-year. We saw strong double-digit growth in converged storage, driven by Nimble and Big Data storage that has become a meaningful part of the portfolio. All-flash arrays grew 20% year-over-year. While the overall storage market remains competitive, we like our current position and expect to take nearly 50 basis points of share this quarter, which will be the 10th time in the last 12 quarters, where we\u2019ve gained or maintained share. Datacenter networking revenue was up 2% with good execution, primarily from our installed base in the Americas. HPE Pointnext revenue was up 1% year-over-year, with operational growth for the seventh consecutive quarter. Overall, orders grew 1% with even better growth in operational services, which was driven by our new HPE GreenLake flexible capacity offering. Service intensity remains strong, but attach orders continue to be under pressure from lower unit growth and richer hardware configurations. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 17% year-over-year and 14% in constant currency. Operating margins of 6.5% were up 360 basis points sequentially due to the operating leverage from higher revenue, but were down 110 basis points year-over-year due to significant investments in sales and R&D. Aligned to our strategy of pivoting to the Intelligent Edge, we\u2019ve been making significant go-to-market and R&D investments that have given us a leadership position in this high-growth market opportunity. Aruba Product grew 18%, with continued strong growth in campus switching and a rebound in wireless LAN, despite tough compares in the prior year. We\u2019ve also started to see good traction in our edge compute business. Aruba Services was up 10% on an installed base growth due to strong attach of our software platform like ClearPass and AirWave. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 5% year-over-year and 1% in constant currency, driven by strong residual sales and growth in our direct business that was somewhat offset by lower operating lease mix. Volume was flat, as growth in our direct business was offset by the pressure in our indirect business. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 7.9% due to one-time items. Now turning to cash flow. Free cash flow was negative $269 million in Q2. The cash conversion cycle was in line with expectations and decreased sequentially by one day to negative 22 days. Both inventory and payables were elevated in the quarter due to strategic positioning of key commodities and somewhat higher pricing. We also ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $3.5 billion. Looking forward, we\u2019re still on track to achieve our free cash flow outlook of approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2018, as the second-half benefits from a few items. First, we expect cash earnings to ramp aligned with normal seasonality and the cost savings from HPE Next. Second, working capital will be a source of cash versus the use of cash in the first-half with the cash conversion cycle improving to the negative high 20-day range similar to our Q4 exit rate. Last, we have fewer a one-time payments and expect incremental real estate sales towards the end of the year. Moving to capital allocation. As part of our $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year 2019, which we announced in Q1, we returned $1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. This includes $907 million of share repurchases and $116 million of dividend payments. As previously communicated, we raised our quarterly dividend by 50%, which will be payable in July. We also announced today that we\u2019ll be redeeming $1.6 billion of our bonds maturing in October at the end of June. The bond redemption is consistent with our capital allocation approach, which includes maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Going forward, we intend to run the operating company with net cash neutral or positive and will maintain financial flexibility through borrowing capacity as needed. Now turning to our outlook. Consistent with our approach in Q1, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal year 2018 by $0.05, due to our operational performance in Q2 and a favorable tax rate that we now expect to be at the low-end of our 11% to 15% guidance for the year. As a result, we expect fiscal year 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.50, and we expect our fiscal year 2018 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.70 to $1.80. For Q3 2018, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.35 to $0.39 and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.19 to $0.23. So overall, I\u2019m pleased with the performance in the quarter and I\u2019m looking forward to focusing on delivering our full-year commitments. Before we open up the call for questions, as Antonio mentioned, I just wanted to remind everyone that we have our IR Summit coming up in June at our Discover Customer Event in Las Vegas, and I hope many of you will be able to join us. Now, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first questioner today will be Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. I think, Antonio and Tim, you both mentioned that DRAM cost increases have started to flatten. Can you remind us what \u2013 how you\u2019re feeling about DRAM and NAND pricing and generally component pricing as we move into the second-half of the year? And I think when we talked about it last quarter that\u2019s going to be somewhat of a pressure on revenue. How are you thinking about that as we move into the second-half? Antonio Neri : Yes, sure. Thanks, Sherri, for the question. So we start to see a flattening of the DRAM cost. We still see what I call nominal low single-digit cost increases, but where we\u2019re able to pass those along for two reasons. One is stronger execution in our go-to-market, more disciplined approach, and second is our competitors are becoming more rational about pricing in general. So it\u2019s going to be a very low kind of cost increase and we feel confident we\u2019ll pass those along. Listen, the AUPs obviously are \u2013 continue to be elevated for two reasons. One is the DRAM, right, we talked before, and two is the richer configurations, right? So the \u2013 particularly on the compute side, the compute side are really driving a significant rich configuration of memory, obviously, flash NAND, internal storage, and that\u2019s why we see the increased AUPs. And those are not going to change any time soon also, because customers are trying to reach more efficiencies in their data centers, particularly as they deploy the private cloud. And the other one is some of these workloads demand that level of configuration, particularly as you move to AI and Big Data analytics. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen so far. Sherri Scribner : Okay, great. And then just looking at the storage business, it seems like you guys have definitely recovered in that business versus some issues you had last year. How are you feeling about the storage business as we move into the second-half? Do you think these revenue growth levels are sustainable, or do you expect them to come back in a bit? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. I mean, listen, storage performed very well, up 24% year-over-year with inclusion of Nimble and 14% organically, which is, to your point, right, we actually executed way better than last year. Last year, we had some execution challenges, particularly North America. ,: And so, as I look forward, we expect to see solid organic growth in storage. But let\u2019s remind ourselves, right, like next quarter, right, we\u2019re going to have the lapping of the Nimble acquisition to the portfolio. So I think the growth rate would be a little bit more moderated, but we\u2019re very confident about our ability to execute with this portfolio, because we have true value differentiation. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Sherri. Can we have the next question, please? Operator : And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. You beat revenue in EPS two quarters in a row and yet the majority of the $0.05 full-year guidance increase is tax-related. So can you just comment on why you\u2019re not assuming that the strong operational trends continue for the remainder of the year? And then just as a related follow-up to that, when you talk about tough compares in the back-half of the fiscal year and lapping acquisitions, does that end in a company that\u2019s not growing top line, or do you think the top line can continue to grow in the back-half just at lower rates? Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. So as far as the $0.05 goes, I\u2019d say, $0.02 of the $0.05 was operational. Again, we continue to perform very well, particularly in the volume piece of the portfolio that\u2019s growing faster than we had expected. As far as why we aren\u2019t passing more through, again, we have quite a bit of execution left in the second-half. We still have six months to go. So we feel that it\u2019s just prudent to pass along the operational performance we\u2019re seeing. And then obviously, we\u2019re trying to be as transparent as we can on the tax front as we\u2019re still working through all those changes. As far as the growth goes, yes, I think we can continue to grow. If you look at the 10% growth that we had in Q2, I\u2019d say, about 3.5 points of that was tailwind from FX. We had a couple points of tailwind from the compares with Nimble and SimpliVity and then we have 4.5 points of execution. And I think it\u2019s really a combination of execution, because I do think our go-to-market motion is working better. I do think that our geo model that we pivoted to this year is working very well. But we also have better markets, right? We have better \u2013 we have stronger customer demand. We have a better pricing environment, so that plays into it as well. As I look forward into the second-half, rates have moved a little bit unfavorably for us. If those rates hold, we would get less of a tailwind. We obviously lose the favorable compares. The other point I would make out is, we\u2019re doing about half of the Tier 1 business in the second-half of the year that we did versus the first-half. So that\u2019s about 2.5 points of headwind, no margin impact and then we have tougher compares overall. So I think, going forward, we can certainly grow, but it\u2019s obviously not going to be at that 10% rate given the reason that just laid out. Antonio Neri : So, Katy, this is Antonio. I want to add the couple of things here. One is, if you go back to what we guided at SAM, right, we said 0% to 1% growth. It\u2019s obvious we\u2019re going to grow faster than that full-year. I think that\u2019s one area. Second is that, we are very, very confident in our portfolio. And I think, as we continue to pivot from volume to value, we will see also an improvement there, because the growth areas we see are in hyper converged in areas like private clouds, high-performance compute and so forth. So we believe this company absolutely can grow and definitely this year will be above the guidance we gave you for the full year. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. You provided an update on HPE Next and some of the accomplishments so far. I think the target was to try and deliver $250 million in net savings for this year and ultimately $800 million over the next three years. Could you provide an update specifically on where you think you are in terms of the savings capture rate so far this year? And whether we should still be thinking about $250 million savings for the year? And I have a follow-up please? Antonio Neri : Sure, Toni, this is Antonio. Thanks for the question. So we are confident we are on track to deliver the $250 million for the year. And just as a reminder, right, HPE Next is the initiative I launched to re-architect the company to deliver on our vision and our strategy. And at the core of this was not just cost savings, right, it\u2019s all about simplification, innovation, and execution. We have made good progress on many fronts. One is, listen, the operating model simplification in a go-to-market is paying off in terms of not just the savings, but actually improved execution. Second, we have reduced already quite significantly number of platforms and options, which translates into lower amounts of SKUs to our customers and partners, which allows us to better plan and execute in our supply chain. And then third is the culture of the company as well. So from my standpoint, we are on track what we said we\u2019re going to do. And to me this is going to be the competitive advantage that Hewlett Packard Enterprise would have going forward. For me, this is not just a way to return shareholder value, but really to improve the way we execute our business every single day. The reality is the market is moving really fast. We need to react to those opportunities quickly, and having a lean mean end-to-end value chain is absolutely essential. So now we\u2019re going enter the second phase of this, which is the transformation in the processes and IT modernization, which actually will give us the incremental step forward on executing even better and more simply in front of the market opportunity. So, Tim, you want to add anything? Tim Stonesifer : No, I think you nailed it. Antonio Neri : All right. Toni Sacconaghi : So the follow-up, it still looks like if we believe that Pointnext has about 30% operating margins, which is historically where it\u2019s been. It still looks like operating margins on servers, storage and the data center networking is in the 1% to 2% range right now, and that probably suggests that server margins are negative still. How should investors just think about what a normalized margin for these businesses are, or has the whole server market move to a market where we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about it that way? And that you\u2019re really looking at a blended margin between support and servers are really becoming the vehicle to selling high-margin support and we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about discrete profitability for each of those? Tim Stonesifer : Yes. So thanks for the question, Toni. I would just say this, I think your math is correct. You\u2019re in the low single-digit range for the hardware businesses. I\u2019m not really going to comment on where those are going. But again, I\u2019ll \u2013 to give you some color, if you look at our overall margin of 8.6%, as we\u2019ve talked about all year, we do think that continues to improve over the course of the year. And that\u2019s really a combination of the increase cost savings from HPE Next, it\u2019s a combination of the acquisitions as they become more and more of accretive as we continue to grow those businesses and right-size those cost envelops. And then to Antonio\u2019s point, as we continue to pivot towards the value portion of our portfolio where we have higher margins and higher attach, that obviously gives us some great lift as well. So we do expect those dynamics to continue through the course of the year. On a normalized, if you will, basis, two or three years down the road, I think, a couple calls ago, I said, I think there\u2019s a couple hundred points of improvement. And I still think that\u2019s true, because, again, even as we exit 2018, we\u2019re still going to have more HPE Next savings and will continue to pivot towards the value portion of the portfolio. Antonio Neri : The other thing I will add, Toni, this is Antonio, is that, listen, when you look at our Q2 performers, right, we improved our Hybrid IT margins by 220 basis points in that business. And obviously, like I said before, the rationalization of platforms and options give us improved profitability on the hardware side. It is obvious that obviously a big chunk of our profitability comes from services. But let\u2019s remind ourselves that profitability of the services business is not just attach, right, is what we call, services-led opportunities and we have pivot our portfolio quite significantly in the last two to three years and we see now the momentum in the way customers want to consume in a more subscription-based model. And that\u2019s why things like HPE GreenLake are very important to us as well. But to Tim\u2019s point, right, we will continue to drive that rigor and discipline in our cost structure and ultimately, the simpler we innovate in our portfolio, the easiest to go sell it to improve that, the pull-through for services and as well for the rest of the HPE portfolio. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Excellent. Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : And the next questioner today will be Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Victor Chiu : Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to ask about free cash flow. It seems like, FCF seems like, it will have to have a quite a sharp step up in the back-half of the year to get you $1 billion target. So, I just was hoping you could give us a little more color around that, how much of the upside is coming from the proceeds from real estate? And what parts of working capital are you expecting will improve that will help drive the cash conversion in the second-half of the year? Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So listen, we\u2019re still confident with $1 billion for fiscal year 2018. Q2 came in at negative $269 million, which to be honest with you, was lighter than we had expected. I think on the last call, I said Q2 would be flattish, and we basically had a higher mix of one-time payments along with some unfavorable movements and other assets and liabilities that was related to the VAT taxes. So those are more timing than anything else. But as you know, in this business, free cash flow is very seasonal. If you look at the last couple of years, we typically have negative free cash flow in the first-half of the year and then we generate a significant amount in the second-half of the year. And I don\u2019t think 2018 is going to be any different and it\u2019s really driven by four things. I mean, first of all, you can look at the earnings ramp, I mean, that\u2019s reflected in our EPS guide, that\u2019s a combination of HPE Next savings, as well as typical seasonality. So that will obviously generate more free cash flow. From a working capital perspective, we actually had a cash usage. In the first-half of the year, we\u2019re going to generate cash. In the second-half of the year, I think, the best indicator to look at there is our cash conversion cycle. As we said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019d expect that to end at the negative high 20- day range. That will be very consistent with where we exited Q4 of 2017 and that generates a significant amount of cash. Other assets and liabilities, we had some unfavorability in the first-half, I would expect that to come back in the second-half. Nothing has really structurally changed when you think about the balance sheet. I\u2019ll go back to the VAT example. We should be collecting on those receivables in the second-half of the year. And then lastly is, we\u2019re going to have fewer one-time payment. So if you look at the SAM presentation that we laid out, we had about $1.1 billion of one-time cash payments, roughly $800 million of that has been taken care of in the first-half of the year, so that provides us a tailwind in the back-half of the year. And then we will have, to your point, we will have some real estate gains in the second-half of the year. So, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts in free cash flow, that\u2019s why it\u2019s very difficult to forecast on a quarterly basis. But given those comments, we feel very good about the $1 billion for fiscal year 2018. Victor Chiu : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thank you, Simon. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. The first question is with regard to AI, I\u2019m just curious how you see some of the new offerings that you\u2019ve launched in some of the acquisition sort of fitting into this? And particularly, I\u2019m curious as to how you\u2019re going to monetize them, because everybody sort of talked about AI and what it\u2019s going to do to the industry. But I\u2019m wondering how it helps you from a competitive standpoint over time? And I have a follow-up. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thank you for the question, Shannon. I mean, I\u2019m actually very excited about AI. We see this every single day. I spent 50% of my time talking to customers. And AI is kind of interesting, because what they\u2019re looking for is to monetize that data faster and trying to understand what they should be doing with the data from a business perspective. So AI gives you the vehicle to accelerate outcomes from the data standpoint, and we already have very strong offerings, both in-memory solutions. If you think about our Superdome Flex and as well as HPE Apollo 6500, which is an AI design platform. And so how we monetize is very simple. We provide services upfront, which is basically the advisory capability how to implement AI in their environment. And number two, how we design and implement the right solution for them. And at the core of this, we already have many, many platforms with AI embedded into it into the most solution development kits that their data scientists can go and develop using whatever tools they want, whether it\u2019s cloud data or Horton works or whatever it is. And so this is a good opportunity for us, and also we are using AI inside our portfolio, right? So we talk about the future of Hybrid IT being adaptive and autonomous. We are leveraging those AI technologies inside our own software-defined infrastructure, an example of that obviously is InfoSight, but you\u2019re going to see more and more of that embedded at the Edge and as well as in our cloud orchestration capabilities. Shannon Cross : Thank you. And then can you talk about how we should think about the model changing as you move more and more to flexible capacity or flexible consumption models over time? I mean, how quickly do you think we make the shift sort of \u2013 we saw it in software obviously to SaaS, and now I guess, we\u2019re seeing it into devices and service over time? Thanks. Antonio Neri : I think, you\u2019re asking a question from the business model perspective or the financial perspective? If it\u2019s financial, I will ask Tim Stonesifer to comment. I mean, what we see right now is, customers like the ability to consume on-prem in a utility-based model. And what that means, they want a fully integrated solution with the hardware or the infrastructure that they need with the software and the services to be able to run at a most efficient way. In many ways, as you know, we talked before how we bring that public cloud experience and economics on prem, and that experience includes the consumption-based models. So depending on the scale, we already can provide customers a very competitive solution on premises. And it\u2019s not just infrastructure as a services, but also outcome as a services. Think about backup recover \u2013 recovery as a service, SAP HANA as a service and so forth. So we already have those solutions available and we see a significant interest and actually a significant uptick in that business. From the financial perspective, right, we have crafted what I think is a very strong and simple solution of our customers, leveraging our strength with our portfolio of financial services, which provide that embedded financing, but is a services-led orientation. And the way we financial treat them is no way \u2013 not different than any subscription-based model. But Tim, maybe you want to comment on that. Tim Stonesifer : No, I would just say that, over time it will improve our recurring revenue and will also improve our profitability. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Shannon. Can we move out to the next question, please? Operator : The next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much and good job on the results and execution. I have a question on the Hybrid IT reporting segment, specifically the Pointnext or the service revenues. If I do the math correctly, that is up about 1% year-over-year, but constant currency down 1% year-over-year. How should we think about why would revenues for Pointnext be down year-over-year when overall, your company results are so strong or how do we bridge the gap between those differences? Antonio Neri : Yes, I just think that\u2019s a factor. Obviously, FX is a challenge. And I think that\u2019s just a factor of the contracts rolling off and given the fact that a lot of these are three-year contracts. You have some timing in there from a translation or FX perspective. Jim Suva : Okay. So if that\u2019s the case, should we expect Pointnext to be challenged the next few quarters then with timing of contracts rolling off? Antonio Neri : No, I think \u2013 think about it \u2013 listen, when we book the orders, right, we book at whatever the currency was at that time. But at the same time, we are booking the orders with, what I call, more favorable currency. And the mix of this is going to dictate basically what the outcome is. But we\u2019re still confident that we\u2019ll continue to drive the growth in this portfolio, driven by this new offerings not just the attach. And that\u2019s why, we are very keen to continue to drive the consumption-based model that Shannon asked the question for, because that HPE GreenLake is growing significantly faster than what we are posting here as a whole segment. Tim Stonesifer : I would say the other thing to look at in that business is the services intensity. So service intensity was up 35% in Q2, so we continue to have more attach dollars per unit. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the clarification in detail. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Jim. Can we move out to the next question, please? Operator : The next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. Steven Milunovich : Thank you. First of all, on the tax rate for fiscal 2019, I think, previously you said the tax rate would go up next year. We were thinking maybe 18%-ish, but does that come down a couple points now? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, we\u2019ll give you guys more color at SAM, because we\u2019re still working through the impact in fiscal year 2018. But to your point, at the last time we guided, we said 16% to 20%. So you\u2019re right in the middle there. Again, I\u2019m not going to give any guidance here for 2019, but we\u2019ll give you full transparency in October at SAM. Steven Milunovich : Okay. And then I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on your private cloud opportunity, what some of the trends you\u2019re seeing is Azure Stack out there and some volume? How is your Microsoft relationship? And I think you actually need new servers if an account were to use as you\u2019re with your products. And maybe talk a little bit about your software offerings. I think, you have some fairly good orchestration software? Antonio Neri : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. So we see good traction in the private cloud segment. We offer a multi-cloud type of solution. Obviously, we have the VMware and we have now a very strong integration between the VMware stack in our HP Synergy. We see a significant traction of Synergy with VMware in particular segments like the financial sector, where they need large deployments of large VM farms, I call it, that ultimately, they can manage significant amount of workloads. The other one is Azure stack. It\u2019s still a little bit early. But we see good traction with Microsoft in providing the true consumption-based model on-prem and off-prem with Azure Stack and Azure cloud. We have now slightly different implementation of that, because we have better engineering integration and we already provide different type solution whether it\u2019s HPE ProLiant or what is now with availability of HPE SimpliVity as well with the Hyper-V solution. And so \u2013 and by the way, with our offering of HPE OneSphere, we also provide an OpenStack and Docker Kubernetes environment for those customers who wants to accelerate deployment of containers. So in the end, we have one platform called HPE OneView that manages any type of infrastructure, whether it\u2019s a traditional Tier 3 approach, converged, hyper converged and composable. And now with the inclusion of Plexxi, which we announced last week, we\u2019ve actually now virtualized in a network and fully integrated natively that solution in all our offerings. And then with HPE OneSphere, we provided through multi-cloud in a Hybrid IT environment, where you deploy VMs or you deploy a container or even a open source type of solution. So we see the traction across them. And I think, we wrap all of that with our consumption-based model, right? And we talked about the HPE GreenLake, and that\u2019s where the customers are very, very interested to work with us. Steven Milunovich : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : And our next questioner today will be Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys. Yes, two, if I could, now ask them both at the same time. The first is, with regard to long-term competitive advantages from Next, makes sense as to how it would improve your processes and your get to market and like that. Could you speak specifically to what you see is some of the competitive advantages relative to the marketplace and to your competition? And then the second question is, I believe there is a comment that the second-half will be more challenging. I was just wondering if you could kind of tease out what some of the challenges specifically you see are in the second-half? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Sure. I mean, as I said before, we truly believe, I believe that HPE Next will be a competitive differentiator for us, because one of the challenges we see in this industry with all the acquisition mergers and whatnot is the ability to provide an integrated experience. With the hard work we have done over the last 6.5 years and position of Hewlett Packard Enterprise clearly in the space where we can compete and win, we have the opportunity to really deliver a whole integrated new experience. And it\u2019s an opportunity of life time. And so, listen, I\u2019ve been in the company for 23 years. And unfortunately, I know every system, every process for good or bad, and I know we have tremendous upside, not only to improve our cost structure, but really improve our growth through better execution once we have these integrated experience. And let me give you example of that. We now \u2013 we\u2019re going to have a simple, much better integrated partner experience with configurators. We\u2019re going to have a no-touch, low-touch model for more the transactional side, particularly as you think about that market in the mid market and SME. We\u2019re going to have a streamlined one single kind of platform for the supply chain, which actually improves not just the, what I call, quote to cash, but also the finance side of the execution. So there\u2019s \u2013 but all of this translates into value both for our customers and for our shareholders, because obviously, we will automate everything we can in that execution. From the growth standpoint, again, like I said before, we are confident we will beat our guidance we gave at SAM, which was 0% to 1%. But obviously, we\u2019re going to have tougher compares, right, as we articulated before, right, the currency is not going to be as strong as a tailwind. We have the, what I call, the acquisitions now in the full run rate. But I\u2019m very confident in our organic growth, because our portfolio is very, very strong. So it\u2019s going to come down to how well we\u2019re going to execute. And we\u2019re executing better and obviously, where we see the opportunity in terms of balancing growth with the profitability, which we just increase again on EPS. Ananda Baruah : Both of those are very helpful. Thanks so much. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Ananda. I think, we have time for one more question. Squeeze the last question, please? Operator : Yes, the question will be from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thank you for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I want to go back to kind of Toni\u2019s earlier question on the progression of your savings that you expect to generate from HPE Next. I\u2019m curious if you could just give us a framework of how much have you realized of the $250 million thus far in the first-half of the year? And when you look at some of the progress of things that you\u2019re going to execute upon manufacturing facilities from 17 down to seven going to one ERP system versus 10, 400 sales comp plans down to 25, et cetera. I\u2019m just curious, can you help us understand what has been done and what maybe still or what you\u2019re planning to execute upon looking through the second-half of the year? And I do again have a follow-up? Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So I\u2019ll answer the financial component then flip it over to Antonio. So if you look at the $250 million, I would say that probably a third of that is in the first-half and two-thirds will be coming in the back-half of the year. And as Antonio mentioned, everything that we have seen so far we\u2019re on track to deliver that. Antonio Neri : Yes, in terms of what has been done, so we already initiated the platform simplification to your point, right? We said 26 platform down to seven and on the volume side and 27 down to nine. So we are well on our way. We\u2019re not completely done on that, but we\u2019re well on our way. In terms of the manufacturing side actually, we have not yet initiated the full transition, because part of this is dependant to the IT implementation. So in the back-half of this year, particularly in the latter part of the year, we\u2019re going to implement the new SAPs instance. And with that foundation with a common data master, we\u2019re going to move to the simplification of our supply chain in number of nodes, which the vast majority will happen in 2019. In terms of core plans, we executed much of that. We entered 2018 in terms of sales core plans, which actually is also one of the reasons why we have executed better, because you\u2019re telling the sellers exactly what to focus on and how they\u2019re going to get paid. And so that\u2019s a \u2013 is a motivator in many ways and that\u2019s where we have better execution. So very confident where we are today, but there\u2019s still a significant amount of work to be done. And it\u2019s a journey that we laid out for the next three years and much of this will also would be dependent on the IT transformation we\u2019re driving, particularly on the low-touch, no-touch, which is going to come in the latter part of 2019, and that will improve again our execution of go-to-market as we continue to pivot from volume to value growth. Aaron Rakers : Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. And maybe this is somewhat tied to it and as the follow-up. When I look at the cash conversion cycle, one thing that stands out as you had about a 17% increase, 40% year-over-year in your inventory carried on the balance sheet coming out this last quarter. Is there strategic purchases being made in the inventory balance or you\u2019re holding more just than what you would naturally hold, given some of these initiatives, or what\u2019s really driving that increase in the inventory side? Tim Stonesifer : Yes, it\u2019s a little bit of both. I mean, we were carrying some excess buffer stock just to make sure that we had enough inventory to meet customer demand. And then you have to remember that we have elevated DRAM costs in there as well, so that has a significant impact. Aaron Rakers : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Aaron, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. With that, I think, we can close up the call. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our call for today. Thank you for attending.",

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today\u2019s earnings release on our website for details. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We delivered solid results across all key financial metrics. We grew revenues and we significantly expanded operating margins. We also delivered EPS well above our outlook and generated strong cash flow. Our focus on shifting our mix to higher-value growth areas while optimizing our volume business is working. This is supported by excellent execution of HPE Next, our initiative to re-architect the Company from the ground up with a goal of driving better operational efficiency and effectiveness. Even as we focus on new growth areas, we continue to deliver solid performance across each of our business segments. This combined with the market momentum will enable us to deliver fiscal year \u201818 revenue and earnings well above our original outlook provided at securities analyst meeting last year. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $7.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by balanced performance across Hybrid IT, Intelligent Edge and Financial Services with particular strong growth in Intelligent Edge segment. We also continued to strengthen our profitability by focusing on the high-value segments of the market, while improving efficiency through our HPE Next actions. In Q3, we achieved non-GAAP operating margins of 9.6%, up 270 basis points from the prior year. As a result, we delivered strong EPS growth in Q3. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 doubled from a year ago and is well above our outlook range of $0.35 to $0.39. From a free cash flow perspective, we delivered $751 million and are well on track to deliver $1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year 2018. Turning to the business segments. In Hybrid IT, we have the right strategy. And in a healthy IT spend environment, we are executing well, and it is showing up in our results. After a strong first half, we continued to see solid growth with revenue of $6.2 billion, which is up 3% year-over-year or up 5% year-over-year, excluding the tier 1 segment. The operating margin expanded 270 basis points to 10.6% from a greater mix of Gen10, improved pricing and savings from HPE Next. We\u2019re also gaining share in the higher margin, high-growth segments like software-defined infrastructure, high-performance compute and mission-critical systems. In compute, ISS core grew 10% year-over-year due to continued market demand and accelerated mix of Gen10, and better options attach, which helped drive improved average units pricing. This is more than offset in the decline in tier 1 commodity server sales, as we intentionally exit that type of business. Our hyperconverged segment, which now includes appliances, infrastructure and our composable offerings, grew over 130% year-over-year and has reached an annual run rate of more than $1 billion. HPE Synergy delivered record revenue and has more than 1,600 customers. Finally, high-performance compute is another area of strength. Revenue was up 9% year-over-year and we continue to be the market leader with roughly 35% market share. And we have strong momentum across both public and increasingly, private sector deployments. For example, in Q3, we announced a new development in our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Department of Energy to build a new supercomputer for the national renewable energy laboratory. The new system named Eagle, will run detailed models that simulate complex processes to advance early research and development of renewable energy technologies across fields, including vehicle, wind power and data science. Outside of compute, storage revenue grew 1% year-over-year even with tough second half compares. At the same time, we saw 70% growth in big data storage. We expect improved organic growth in Q4 as we drive increased sales productivity and as our latest storage offerings gain customer traction. For example, in July, we expanded our offering of HPE InfoSight across our 3PAR portfolio, which now enables intelligent all-flash storage for our customers. HPE InfoSight is our artificial intelligence platform that helps our customers operate more efficiently in an autonomous data center. We also introduced the next generation of our HPE Nimble Storage platform that enhances the protection of our customers\u2019 investments and incorporates our store more guarantee, which provides customers with a significant upfront and long-term financial advantage by offering the industry\u2019s first guarantee of storage efficiency. We continue to strengthen our HPE Pointnext services business, and we see significant opportunity as we execute our services-led go-to-market strategy. In Q3, HPE Pointnext revenue was down 1% year-over-year, but overall orders grew 4%. More importantly, our most profitable operational services business grew 1%, with orders up 8%. This growth is largely due to strong improvement of services intensity as we shift our focus in more value-added offerings, high-growth in HPE GreenLake and some larger deals. Advisory and professional services revenue was down 10%, largely due to our intentional exit of more than 40 companies as part of our HPE Next plan, and we continue to invest in new services capabilities. For instance at HPE Discover in Las Vegas, we announced our next generation of HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud to help our customers optimize their hybrid cloud operating models. By eliminating the need for staff to manage their hybrid environments day to day, the new HPE GreenLake solution enables them to focus on innovation. Overall, our Hybrid IT portfolio of products and services is stronger than it has ever been, and continues to help our customers manage and simplify their IT in a hybrid world. Turning to the Intelligent Edge segment, performance remains strong with revenue of $785 million, up 10% year-over-year. We saw particular strength in our campus segment, driven by our secure cloud offerings. Looking forward, Intelligent Edge is a significant long-term growth opportunity for us, therefore, a key area of investment. I said that because there is a major transition happening right now, driven by the explosion of the data created at the edge. The edge is the word outside the data center. And Gartner says, 75% of the world\u2019s data is generated at the edge. I am certain that the rise of Intelligent Edge is the next great market transition coming. And HPE is uniquely committed to and build for this transition. We already have a competitive advantage at the edge with Aruba, pioneering networking with HPE\u2019s deep history in continued innovation, compute storage and services. That is why we recently announced that we plan to invest $4 billion in this statement over the next four years. To give the examples of the innovation, we are driving Intelligent Edge on Aruba\u2019s new software-defined brand solution and our converge OT/IT edge solutions. We see a world that is edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And our portfolio of Intelligent Edge solutions is resonating with customers. In Q3, Aruba won significant new deals with customers, including Caesars Entertainment which will roll out Aruba wireless LAN across their large public venues, and a deal with University of Arkansas where Aruba will completely replace the existing networking system, including software and security. We\u2019re also seeing strong traction with our Edgeline system in industrial IoT applications. For example, a leading auto manufacture is deploying these systems to pioneer the convergence of operational technologies and enterprise-class IT functions, all in a single solution. This new integration is allowing customers to reduce costs in the manufacturing operations while increasing production rates. Finally, HPE Financial Services had another strong quarter, delivering revenue of $928 million, up 3% year-over-year with strength in our asset management business. Financial Services remains a consistent and predictable business for us as customers continue to look for flexible alternative ways to consume and finance their technology needs. In addition to strong business performance, our efforts with HPE Next continue to pay off as we build on the progress we made in the first half of the year. For example, in order to improve our operations, we have significantly simplified our portfolio by reducing our compute platform by nearly 60% and our options by nearly 80%, bringing our total live SKUs down by about 75%. We\u2019re already starting to see the benefits of this effort show up in our results as the simplification is driving more focus and lower costs. In our supply chain, we are consolidating our manufacturing sites and have already reduced the location by more than half. This has cost us around facilities, test equipment, as well as planning and product setup costs. We also completed a final wave of transition to partner-led models in 11 countries in Europe, Middle East and Africa, which enable us to continue to serve these market with value partners while we focus on improving our execution in the markets that drive 99.5% of our revenue. Finally, we have also continued to invest in innovation with an emphasis in Intelligent Edge, software-defined, artificial intelligence and cloud-enabled technologies. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performance in the quarter. We continue to execute against our strategy, which is clearly resonating with customers. I am excited about the Company position. And against a strong market backdrop, we are well on track to meet or exceed our full year financial commitments as we continue to focus on delivering for our customers and partners and driving significant shareholder value. Now, before I turn over the call to Tim, let me address the other news we announced today. After four and half years at the Company during a period of incredible transformation, Tim is stepping down at the end of our fiscal year. Tim played a significant role in turning HP around and contributing to the largest operation in corporate history as we launched Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. He has helped us demerge two major businesses, which deliver more than $20 billion of transaction value and has overseen the completion of 11 acquisitions. Tim has been an incredible partner, advisor and friend to me as we navigated tremendous change together. As I said in our announcement, Tim has helped make HPE\u2019s future possible. We are very well-positioned for future success because of Tim\u2019s leadership and commitment to this Company, our employees and our shareholders. Tim will remain with the Company through the end of October 2018 to help ensure a smooth transition to Tarek Robbiati who will join us as a new CFO, effective September 17th. You will have the opportunity to meet Tarek at our securities analyst meeting at the New York Stock Exchange on October 24th. Tarek is a seasoned executive with significant global expedience, managing both business and financial strategy and operations at public and private health companies within the telecommunications, media, technology and financial services industries. He most recently served as a CFO Sprint Corporation where he was responsible for all finance functions as well as mergers and acquisitions and business development. He drove Sprint\u2019s transformation efforts to significantly reduce operating expenses and he played a strategic leadership role in repositioning the Company ahead of its closing merger with T-Mobile. HPE will benefit from Tarek\u2019s financial expertise, his customer-centric mindset and his industry segment knowledge. And I look forward to partner with him as we continue to execute against our sound strategy that Tim helped us create. I\u2019m tremendously grateful to Tim for all he has helped us achieve. And it is my pleasure now to turn the call over to him to provide additional details about our performance and financial outlook. With that, I will turn over to Tim. Tim Stonesifer : Thanks, Antonio, for the kind words. Our Q3 financial results were strong with good revenue growth, significantly improved operating margins, better than expected earnings and healthy cash flow. Total revenue for the quarter was $7.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 1% in constant currency. Top line performance was driven by solid execution and good market dynamics that we expect to continue. From a portfolio mix perspective, we continue to drive good growth in our value offerings and our core volume business continues to grow better than expected. From a macro perspective, IT spending continues to be healthy, with robust customer demand, the market remains competitive but pricing remains rational, and we continue to pass through commodities costs. DRAM cost increases appear to have peaked; and NAND prices while less of an impact on our portfolio have become more favorable. Currency drove a 230 basis-point tailwind to revenue year-over-year. Foreign exchange rates have continued to move unfavorably. So, we will not have as large of a tailwind in Q4 and expect less than 1 point of benefit to revenue in Q4 if current rates hold. Regionally, HPE\u2019s performance was solid around the globe. Americas\u2019 revenue was down 3% in constant currency, but grew 1% excluding tier 1 business. Both core compute and edge grew 10%. Revenue growth in EMEA continued to be strong, up 3% in constant currency, with particular strength in the UK, France and Italy. Performance in EMEA was good across all business units, particularly in compute and data center networking. Asia-Pacific grew 6% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in Japan, and Australia. Growth in APJ was also solid across all business segments with normal strength in compute and edge. Turning to margins. The gross margin of 30.7% was up 140 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially, non-GAAP operating margin of 9.6%, was up 270 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially. Pricing was favorable this quarter as we focus on improving compute margins and we no longer face significant headwinds from commodity costs. We also delivered expected savings from HPE Next. Looking at the full year, we will continue to take advantage of healthy demand and grow our volume business, much better than expected, which optimizes our operating profit. We now expect fiscal year \u201818 non-GAAP operating margin to be just over 9% compared to our prior 9.5% target. Longer term, we will continue to expand margins by driving further cost savings from HPE Next and improving the mix of our value portfolio, which has higher margins and Pointnext services attached. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 is well above the high-end of our previous outlook of $0.35 to $0.39 due to strong operational performance, favorable onetime benefits in OI&E and a lower-than-expected tax rate. The Q3 non-GAAP tax rate was 8%. This is below our previously provided tax range of approximately 11% due to a favorable shift in the mix of earnings and the delay of certain tax expenses from Q3 now expected in Q4. Consequently, we expect our Q4 tax rate to be elevated but still come in at approximately 11% for the full year, aligned to our prior guidance. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.29, above our previously provided outlook range of $0.19 to $0.23, primarily due to the same reasons as the non-GAAP results. Now turning to the business units. In Hybrid IT, revenue was up 3% year-over-year and flat in constant currency. Operating margins were 10.6%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially and in line with our expectations. Compute revenue was up 5% year-over-year and 10% excluding Tier 1. We saw continued momentum in our value business with hyperconverged and synergy of triple digits and mission critical growing 10%. Revenue growth in our core volume business was once again higher than planned, driven by strong growth in core rack and tower. Also, we continued to drive higher AUPs in core compute, up over 25% by increasing our mix of Gen10 servers with richer attach configurations, improving pricing and to a lesser extent, passing through elevated DRAM costs. Structural AUP increases which exclude elevated DRAM costs, made up more than 75% of the total increase and more than offset core unit declines, which moderated to low double digits this quarter. Looking forward, we expect unit declines to moderate which will continue to be offset by structural AUP increases, driven by an increasing mix of Gen10, which is now just over 50% of the portfolio and continues to ramp. Storage revenue was up 1% year-over-year as we faced tougher second half compares. With that said, big data had another strong quarter with high double digit growth and entry storage growth was also solid. Looking forward into Q4, we should start seeing the benefits of the increased number of new sales specialists that we hired earlier in this year. And as Antonio mentioned, we\u2019re excited about the recent enhancements we\u2019ve made to our offerings, particularly with HPE\u2019s InfoSight platform that has been extended to the 3PAR portfolio. Given this, we expect the growth rates in storage to pick up next quarter. Data center networking revenue declined 6% in the quarter as growth rates can vary on a quarter-by-quarter basis from the smaller business. But, we still expect to deliver solid growth for the full year. HPE Pointnext revenue was down 1% year-over-year but orders were up 4% year-over-year with operational services orders up 8% that included a few large deals. As you think about the relationship between orders and units, keep in mind that roughly 25% of total Pointnext orders are related to new attach. And in new attach, we have been shifting our focus to more value-added offerings that drive up services intensity, which was up nearly 20% year-over-year. We\u2019re also growing other non-attach services like our consumption based offerings with HPE GreenLake, which was up over 40%. As a result, we have more than offset recent unit declines and grown operational services orders, our most profitable business, for three consecutive quarters. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 10% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency with strength across all regions. Operating margins of 11.6% were down 300 basis points year-over-year due to significant investments in sales and R&D, but up 510 basis points sequentially due to the operating leverage from higher revenue. Aligned to our strategy of pivoting to the Intelligent Edge, we have been making significant investments that have given us a leadership position in this high-growth market opportunity. Aruba product grew 10%, with continued strong growth in campus switching and edge compute. Aruba services was up 14% on continued installed base growth due to strong attach of our software platform like ClearPass and AirWave. HPE Financial Services revenue grew 3% year-over-year and 3% in constant currency, driven by strong residual sales and solid growth in our direct business. Volume remained strong, up 15% year-over-year across all regions and with growth in both our direct and indirect business. Operating profit increased 20 basis points year-over-year to 7.9%. Now, turning to cash flow. Free cash flow was $751 million in Q3. The cash conversion cycle was in line with expectations and decreased sequentially by one day to negative 23 days. We expect our cash conversion cycle to show improvement in Q4, similar to last year, as we further bring on inventory levels following strategic positioning of key commodities in prior quarters. We also expect cash earnings to be higher in Q4 and are well on track to achieve our free cash flow outlook of $1 billion in fiscal year \u201818. We ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $3.2 billion. Moving to capital allocation. As part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year \u201819, which we announced in Q1, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. This includes the previously announced 50% dividend increase, totaling $170 million in dividend payments. We repurchased $936 million in shares in the quarter and will likely exceed our $3.5 billion buyback target for fiscal year \u201818 as we look to buy back shares opportunistically. Now, turning to our outlook. As a reminder, we started the year with a fiscal year \u201818 outlook of the $1.15 to $1.25. In the past two quarters, we\u2019ve raised our outlook for operational performance we delivered in the quarter and onetime benefits. We will do that again in this quarter by passing through our Q3 operational upside and benefits and OI&E, plus we\u2019ll pass through additional operational outperformance in Q4 as we remain confident in our execution against a good market backdrop. As a result, we will increase our fiscal year \u201818 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to $1.50 to $1.55, and we expect fiscal year \u201818 GAAP diluted net earnings per share $1.85 to $1.90. So, overall, I\u2019m pleased with the performance in the quarter. This was our third consecutive quarter with operational outperformance and another proof point to the strength of our strategy and financial architecture laid out for you at the security analyst meeting in 2017. I\u2019m looking forward to closing out the fiscal year with another strong quarter. Now, before we open up the call for questions, I\u2019d just like to say, it\u2019s been a privilege to be part of this team, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. As I reflect on my time as a CFO, we launched HPE, we repositioned the portfolio with the ES and software spin, mergers, we accelerated our strategy with multiple acquisitions while returning $10 billion of cash to shareholders, and we created a significant amount of value. This year, we made great progress on HPE Next and we\u2019ve met or exceeded all of our key financial commitments. I would like to say thanks for Antonio for being a great business partner, to Meg Whitman for giving me this opportunity, to the Board for all their insights during this transformation, and most importantly, to all of my HPE colleagues for their support and dedication to make all this happen. The Company is in an excellent position to continue to deliver. Now with that, let\u2019s open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. We will now begin to question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first questions will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. How much of the $0.07 EPS beat this quarter would you attribute to operational or execution factors versus some of the one time and tax benefits? And given the guidance increase just flows through that 3Q beat, why not assume that that execution continues? Then, I have a follow-up on servers. Tim Stonesifer : Sure. Thanks, Katy. So, as far as the beat goes, I\u2019d say, $0.02 of that was operational, $0.03 was driven by some favorable OI&E which was driven by primarily FX, and then another $0.02 was driven by the favorable tax rate, which is really just going to be a shift between Q2 -- or Q3 and Q4. Now, when you look at the total year-ago, going from the $1.40 to $1.50 up to where we are, I would say $0.02 of that was the operational improvement in Q3, which to your point, we passed through consistent as in prior quarters, $0.03 of that is the OI&E onetime benefit, but we are flowing through another $0.02 of operational improvements because we do expect to continue to execute in Q4 along with a good market backdrop. Katy Huberty : And then, as we think about the server business, will revenue growth in the foreseeable future come entirely from mix shift and AUP increases or do you have any line of sight into units stabilizing year-over-year, or even returning to growth over the next year? Antonio Neri : Yes. Good afternoon, Katy. This is Antonio. So, yes, we expect to continue to grow the business, despite the fact that we continue to deemphasize our focus on that commoditized server business. And this quarter, as you can see, we grew the business 5%, and if you take the tier 1, up 10%. And the reason why it\u2019s because obviously the demand is there. And ultimately, the strategic growth categories continue to grow at a healthy space, and we continue to gain share in this particular segment. And then, last but not least, we have made structural changes in our AUPs, and maybe Tim can reinforce that comment because he made the comment that 75% of that AUP increase was driven by structural changes. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. So, again, our definition of structural is excluding everything that\u2019s associated with the pass through of increased commodity costs. So, as you look going forward, I would expect to continue to see structural improvements, primarily given by the fact that one, we\u2019re going to continue to attach to richer configs. And if you look at the Gen10 server mix today, it\u2019s roughly just over 50% of the overall portfolio. So, there\u2019s still room to grow there. So, I\u2019d expect that to offset any unit pressure that we see going forward. Operator : The next question will be from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sherri Scribner, your line is open on this site. You maybe muted. Andrew Simanek : I think she got disconnected. Operator : Okay. We\u2019ll go on to the next question. It will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. It sounded like you felt you had a lot of profit tailwinds in Hybrid IT segment this quarter, excellent execution on HPE Next, DRAM pricing environment, better structural price improvements and volume sequentially was up a couple hundred million on and also, your mix of tier 1 was down which should have helped. So, I guess in light of those things, why did we not see more sequential improvement in operating margins in Hybrid IT? And I have a follow-up, please. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. Again, I mean, if you look at the sequential improvements overall, it was driven by those things. So, if you look at the mix improvement, if you look at some of the -- as we right size across acquisitions, as we deliver the HPE Next. So, that was in line with our expectations. Keep in mind, we did do some recent acquisitions. So, there is a little bit of incremental OpEx in there as we take that into the system. But overall, we were pleased with our margin improvements. And again, this is a plan that has been built on that. We talked about that going back to Q1 and we see nice expansion in Q2, Q3, would expect that to continue in Q4. Toni Sacconaghi : And then, I just have two minor clarifications. So, your tax rate, you\u2019re expecting to be 11% for the full year. I think, at the end of Q1, you said you expected your tax rate next year to be 16% to 20%. Should we still be thinking about that or are there discrete structural changes? And then, could you clarify what server unit growth was in total, and then ex tier 1 please. Tim Stonesifer : So, as far as the tax rate goes, we would expect it to still be in that 16% to 20% range. And then, from a unit -- what was the second question? Antonio Neri : The second question was total unit growth. So, Toni, on that one, Tim made a comment in his remarks that the total units when you add everything, it was actually down low double digits. So, it\u2019s an improvement quarter-over-quarter. And we continue to see that moderate obviously on the growth areas that we are emphasizing. And that\u2019s mostly driven because of the tier 1, right, as we exit, year-over-year. But we are emphasizing and growing the aspects of the other portfolio. So, I think, as we go forward we expect that to stabilize, moderate to stabilize, and then continue to drive the structural price changes that we saw this quarter, which we expect to continue. Operator : The next question will be from Rob Cihra of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Rob Cihra : It was mentioned a couple of times, you expect the storage growth to improve next quarter. And I\u2019m just wondering, apart from slightly easier compare, what\u2019s driving that? Is that market, is that HPE specific as you move past the Nimble acquisition now? Antonio Neri : Sure. I mean, this quarter, we grew storage as a segment 1%. When you look with the combination of that segment plus the other platforms, including hyperconverged and composable, actually total growth is 12%. And within that also, we saw big base of storage growing 70%, because that\u2019s the demand. So, we see the explosion of data continue. And you have to store the data somewhere. And obviously more hybrid cloud capabilities are needed going forward. And that\u2019s the beauty about our Nimble platform, which provides cloud volume, so you can move data back and forth between on-prem and off-premises, provide an intelligent proper with HPE InfoSight. So, we expect the combination of the data growth, plus our increased productivity in our force, plus differentiation of the portfolio to continue to accelerate the growth In storage. And obviously, each sub segment of that storage segment will play differently. But we are very confident about our ability to grow storage because we have a differentiated portfolio, very autonomous in many way, self healing. And then ultimately, we introduce new platforms now, as customers get more acquainted with those platforms. We believe we have a true value differentiated offer in the market. Operator : Your next question will be from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate you reiterated the target for the full year free cash flow generation of $1 billion. I think, what I\u2019m trying to understand is how much of the pattern we observe on a quarterly basis is abnormal versus what you would think is normal, because it looks like you\u2019re generating much of that target in the fourth fiscal quarter. And I\u2019m really -- my objective here is to think about the longer term free cash flow generation. Maybe help us think about puts and takes around that trend? Tim Stonesifer : Sure. Free cash flow is a tough one to model because of the complexity of the balance sheet and the timing. So, I mean, the way I would think about it, as we\u2019ve discussed before, when you look at this business and you go back the last couple of years, and \u201818 is no different. The first half of the year, we consume a lot of cash and the second half of the year we generate a significant amount of cash. And the profile has been pretty consistent, if you go back to prior years. And that has a whole host of reasons. But, I would just -- I think the trends that we\u2019re having are consistent. If you look at Q3, we generated $751 million. So, we\u2019re now, if you look at quarter to date, it\u2019s $70 million for the year. So, between cash earnings and then some continued improvement in our cash conversion cycle, we ended Q3 at negative 23 days. We\u2019d expect to be at the high negative 20-day range in Q4, very similar to last year. So, those are kind of the dynamics. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to really change as we go forward. Simon Leopold : Great, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up. I wonder if we could get maybe a little bit of color commentary on your progress around hyperconverged infrastructure? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Sure. We are very pleased with our progress in hyperconverged. Again, we grew the total segment 130% year-over-year, which is roughly 3 times the market. Our HPE SimpliVity platform continue to grow very, very, nicely driven by the efficiency of the software defined storage that\u2019s built into it with the industry leading HPE ProLiant server, which is the most secure server platform on the planet. In addition to our HP OneView, which is a software-defined data center infrastructure, which has significant capabilities in terms of provisioning, lifecycle management and more and more automated AI capabilities built into it. But also, let\u2019s remember that part of the hyperconverged as we move into what we call composable infrastructure, which is a superset of the hyperconverged, continues to grow very, very nicely. In fact, we grew triple digits, and now we have 1,600 customers on it. And so, that\u2019s a platform we are very proud of the work we have done. And again, bringing the innovation that really matters for our customers, which already are looking to deploy infrastructure that\u2019s efficient and cloud like with the same economics and the same way to consume it. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s resonated with customers. Operator : And the next question will be Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : I wanted to just asked if you could give us any more color on why the Americas constant currency growth was down 3% in the quarter, and it\u2019s grown 4% in the last couple of quarters. So, you would you be able to comment on what\u2019s happening there, considering it seems like a pretty strong enterprise spending environment? And then, I have a follow-up. Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So, if you look at the Americas, to your point, down 3%, if you look at tier 1, we have a significant amount of our tier 1 business is in the Americas. If you exclude that we were actually up 1%. And if you look at compute, again excluding tier 1, we were up 10% in the Americas. And if you at edge as well, we\u2019re up 10% in the Americas. You really need to take the tier 1 into account there. But overall, we felt pretty good about our growth across all of our markets. Antonio Neri : And I will say, most of the concentration of tier 1 where the bills were created and so forth, they\u2019re all in the mostly in the North America region. Rod Hall : And then, I wanted to just clarify your commentary around unit volumes and juxtapose that with the AUP commentary. I thought I heard you say that AUPs were up over 25%. But, I wasn\u2019t sure if that was for a total servers or some sub segment. And then revenues are up 5%, but you\u2019re saying that units are down low double digits. So, can you just piece those together for me, so that it\u2019s clear what the AUP contribution and the unit contribution was for the total? Tim Stonesifer : So, the core -- the 25% is related to core compute, and that was pretty consistent with what we did in Q2. So, again, I think, the best way to think about it is if you look at the structural increases, so take out the effect of the pass through of commodity cost increases that attributes roughly 75% of the price increase. And then, if you look at units in core, they were down sort of low double digits, and that\u2019s kind of how you get to the numbers. Operator : Your next question will be from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Two, if I could. The first is just as regards to Next and the ongoing benefit from mix in the core business, what would be -- if you sort of flow the numbers through that you provided at the analyst day for that through next year, so fiscal \u201819 and I then I guess even holding all else equal, it would suggest potential for pretty nice jump up op income dollars in \u201819 from \u201818. And then, given how well you\u2019ve done repositioning the business, mix et cetera, Gen10 in \u201818, it would seem that there would even be a little bit more life behind that. So, could you -- what would be the reason -- I mean that\u2019s anecdotal, what would be the reason that maybe we would not be positioned to see a nice lift up in \u201819 EPS from \u201818 EPS? And then, I have a follow-up. Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So, listen, we\u2019re going to give you a plenty of color on \u201819, next month at the security analyst meeting or in two months. But, here is a couple of things to think about. I mean, the levers to your point, as you look at \u201819 versus \u201818 will be very similar to what we laid out at the security analyst meeting last year. So, HPE Next that will drive some nice improvements in \u201819 from a year-over-year basis. As we continue to make progress on that initiative and we\u2019re well on track. And that should be somewhat aligned to what we saw this year. Mix will also play impact. So, we\u2019re going to continue to mix up and grow the higher margin pieces of portfolio. We\u2019ve got some nice traction in \u201818, we would expect that to continue in \u201819, particularly against a good market drop. FX, you can look at the rates today and look at where we were before. That will probably, if those rates hold, that would be a headwind as you go into \u201819. So take that into account. OI&E, we\u2019ve had a few onetime benefits this year. We had one in Q1, we just talked about one in Q3. So, I would take that into account as you look at a year-over-year view. I think rates are higher now than they were before. So, I would take that into account as well. And then, we\u2019ll see some pressure on the tax rate, because if we come in as expected between that 16% to 20% rate as compared to the 11% rate this year that will be a pressure point. And then lastly share account, I mean share account should be favorable next year as it was this year. So, again, we\u2019re going to give you all that color at the security analyst meeting but those are the levers that I think about. Antonio Neri : And I will say -- just a comment here. I think Tim did excellent job in articulating the financial view of this. But I have to say, I\u2019m incredible proud of the work that we have done. We\u2019re executing HP Next further plan and they are executing well, despite all the transformation we\u2019re driving. Ananda Baruah : Thanks for the detail. Tim, just quickly, I would love your view on normalized free cash flow. At Discovery, you guys gave for the first time a number related to the dynamics that you\u2019ve been talking about for a few quarters, the $1.5 billion. Could you just talk a little bit about normalized free cash flow and how we should think about that and when we can expect you guys to get there? Thanks. Tim Stonesifer : Yes. Again, we\u2019re going to lay all that out at the security analyst meeting. Our view is still our normalized free cash flow is in the $2 billion range. We will not get there next year, as we\u2019ve talked about, because we have charges related to HPE Next, which again, are critical to transforming this business and positioning us for success going forward, but we\u2019ll give you plenty of detail at the security analyst meeting. Operator : Certainly and that will be Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thank you. And Tim, congratulations. I wanted to go back to the ASP discussion a little bit and take it a little differently. If you just isolate out the 25% out of the 75% that\u2019s related to component pricing, I\u2019m curious of how you see the environment progressing over the next couple of quarters. And whether or not we should be assuming that that you have to start to pass through the possibility that component pricing starts to decline and your customers start to ask for that to be given back on the ASP side? Tim Stonesifer : Yes. I mean, certainly now, if you look at DRAM cost, it\u2019s certainly moderated, and we are passing through those incremental costs. So, I think going forward, if this thing was to move in a different direction, I would expect that to be passed through as well. My experience in prior industries is that when commodities go down, it\u2019s a little bit easier to hold on to them on their way down. So, we should get a little bit of benefit from that. But, we\u2019ll see what happens. And the other big thing too is, what are our competitors doing, and what is the competitive pricing landscape out there if that were to happen? Aaron Rakers : And then, as a real quick follow-up, I apologize if I missed it. But you talked a little bit about storage and storage coupled with HCI, but I think in the past you\u2019ve provided some metrics around the growth of your all-flash business, I was curious if you could provide that this quarter? Tim Stonesifer : Yes. We typically don\u2019t break that out. All-flash is part of -- to your point, the overall storage, but we keep it at the overall storage level. Operator : It will be Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to first follow up on Rod\u2019s question about the decline in the Americas. You cited the tier 1s. Does that imply that the run off of the tier 1 customers has picked up, and how much of that is left to go? Antonio Neri : So, this was at the peak. Remember, we said this was 15% of our total compute business. And so, there\u2019s still some way to go. And remember that there is seasonality in that business based on when that builds -- buildouts with these large hyperscale data center took place. So, we still have some business, and we are transitioning that business as we speak. But, as I said before, most of those build-outs are actually in the United States. Jeff Kvaal : And then, secondly, as a follow-up, can I ask, we haven\u2019t talked about tariffs yet. And I\u2019m wondering if you have some thoughts on what might happen in the tariff landscape, and how you might be preparing for various eventualities and how we might want to prepare for various eventualities? Antonio Neri : Sure. I mean, this is a very complex topic. Let\u2019s say, most of the U.S. tech firms relying on complex supply chain and HPE is not different. So, this system, call it, has been built over many decades. And we need to understand the details, honestly, it\u2019s too early. We don\u2019t have the full details. Obviously we are provided inputs in the right forums. And we believe there is different ways to address this problem. But, from our vantage point, we are looking at scenarios depending on where this is going to land. And once we have the details, we will let you know if there is an impact or not. But we have already kind of maneuvered through to different iterations of this, we\u2019re able to do good job in mitigating the latest one, we still have to wait till the end of September to see what happens. Tim Stonesifer : Just to give you some financial context around that. I mean, less than 5% of our total cost of sales envelop comes directly from China. So, it\u2019s a big number, but it\u2019s not a huge number. To Antonio\u2019s point, after rounds one and two, we have been able to make some changes in our supply chain motion and think there is minimal risk from a financial perspective. When you look at rounds three and four, that would impact kind of the half of that 5% that I just mentioned. That\u2019s really going to be dependent on do they go with 10% or 25%. It will be dependent on whether we can make any more changes in our supply chain motion. And the other thing to keep in mind is this is not just an HPE thing, this is an industry thing, so, how will the competition in the industry respond with regards to passing that through on the pricing front. So, we think it\u2019s minimal impact at this stage, but to Antonio\u2019s point, we\u2019re keeping an eye on it to make sure we understand the changes. Andrew Simanek : Thank you. I think we have time for one last question, please. Operator : And that will be Paul Coster of JP Morgan. Paul Coster : You\u2019re in investment mode as far as the Intelligent Edge is concerned. So, you must be under earning in that segment. Could you give us some sense of how much you\u2019re under earning by, whether it\u2019s in terms of margins or dollars? And then, I have a follow-up. Tim Stonesifer : Sure. So, if you look at Q3, you will note that in edge that our margins were down about 510 basis points. That is primarily driven by the fact that we are investing in sales and in R&D. Again, the edge is a key pillar to our strategy. That\u2019s going to be a high-growth, high-margin opportunity for us. And we\u2019re going to continue to invest there. Now, what I will note is, if you look at it sequentially, they are up. So, they\u2019re up 510 basis points. So I think they\u2019re down 300 basis points year-over-year. Sorry. And they are up 510 basis points sequentially, which just shows you that that operating leverage and that revenue leverage is important, given the margin profile in that business. Paul Coster : And can you give us some sense of what it is you\u2019re investing in? I\u2019m particularly interested in the sort of probable convergence of your technology with point-to-point, points-to-multipoint? Antonio Neri : Sure. Obviously, we have a very strong platform with Aruba and which provides connectivity. But it\u2019s also a mobile first, cloud first platform. And we -- what we are doing there is invest in security and cloud consumption based models and analytics. Those are the three big areas. And if you think about the type of organic and inorganic investments we've made in the last, let\u2019s say 18 months with acquisition of Niara, which provides now AI security embedded in our platform, or whether it\u2019s Cape Networks, or even RASA Network, they are all geared into that direction. So, there is to continue to expand the adjacency around the core campus and really provide the digital platform that customers are looking for. And then, on the industrial side, obviously, we see now new use cases in term of IoT applications, which customers are looking the convergence of what we call operational technologies and enterprise IT class technologies. Because ultimately, much of that data in the industrial space is analog data which has to be digitized and then analyzed. And in that space, we see the opportunity to bring what we call edge computing closer where the data is generating and yet provide [technical difficulty] for customers to deploy this new framework. So, we see that continue to grow, and it\u2019s going to be very industry-driven and obviously very use case-driven. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Paul. I think with that we can wrap up the call for today. Thanks, everyone, for joining. Antonio Neri : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call. Hewlett Packard Enterprise deliver another strong quarter in Q4, concluding a very successful fiscal year 2018. As we close my first fiscal year as a CEO, I\u2019m thrilled with where we\u2019re stand in the marketplace; and I\u2019m very excited about our team and our strategy. Our strategy should be familiar to all of you at this point. We are accelerating growth in the Intelligent-Edge, delivered in profitable growth in a hybrid IT space; and continue to grow operating profit and expand margins all while investing for growth in the future. To do that, we\u2019ve been driving a better delivered strategic shift of our portfolio. Which we first laid out for you are the Security Analyst Meeting in 2017. We have been focused on executing against our strategy and we\u2019ve delivered on what we said we will do. In fact, we exceeded the revenue growth, non-GAAP, operating profit, non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow tied to get that we said at the Security Analyst Meeting over a year-ago. We are driving both meaningful top line growth and margin expansion, fueling shareholder returns, and we're doing all of that while simultaneously advancing our innovation agenda, laying the foundation to deliver value in the future to customers, partners, and shareholders. Fiscal year 2018 shows this strong momentum I\u2019m talking about. For the full-year, we grew revenue 7%, well above $30 billion, which is even slightly higher than I predicted on our 2018 Security Analyst meeting in October. We achieved 13% growth in our strategic Intelligent Edge segment for the year with $2.9 billion in revenue. We grew our large Hybrid IT business this year by 6% to over $25 billion. Our growth this year was nicely balanced from a geographic perspective with particular strength in EMEA. I commend our team in Europe for executing very well on their go-to-market priorities and getting traction in value segments, which are particular strong results against a backdrop of political and economic challenges in that region throughout the year. At the same time, even as we drove impressive growth, we also expanded profitability in fiscal year 2018 generating $2.8 billion in non-GAAP operating profit. That is an increase of $576 million in profit over the prior fiscal year. This profitability enabled us to exceed our free cash flow targets generating $1.1 billion for the year, largely powered by strong cash flow from operations of $3 billion, which more than doubled over the prior year. Lastly, we also returned more than $4 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2018. Our performance in fiscal year 2018 tells me we have the right strategy at the right time, and that we have the right leadership team driving innovation and execution. We have strong momentum across our differentiated portfolio as we head into an expected healthy IT spending environment in 2019. Let's take a quick look at our portfolio. Our competitive differentiation is becoming increasingly clear to customers, it should be to all of you as well. At Discover Madrid last week and at the Security Analyst meeting in New York in October, we talked a lot about our unique ability to advance our customers businesses. We do this through a strategic mix of product and services that address their current needs while also them transition to an edge-centric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven enterprise of the future. So how are we doing that? First, we believe the Intelligent Edge is the next frontier and it is our top strategic priority. 75% of the data is created at the Edge and our customers increasingly need help to tuning all their data from the Edge to the Cloud into intelligence they can use in real-time. This business is growing double digits, up 15% for the full-year. All three categories within this business campus and branch, edge compute and Aruba services are demonstrating meaningful growth. And as more compute capacity moves to the Edge, we expect this business to continue to be a driver for us. Our Hybrid IT business, which includes compute, storage, data center networking and our Pointnext services business also had solid year-over-year growth in fiscal year '18 of 6%, coupled with meaningful operating margin expansion of a full percentage point. The secret of our success in Hybrid IT is that we continue to focus deliberately and successfully on portfolio mix. Our compute value offerings grew 9% for the year included 25% growth in high-performance compute. Also, our composable offerings with HPE Synergy have an incredible year growing over 280% and reaching an annual run rate of over $1 billion. And even as we orchestrate the shift from volume to value, we still posted better-than-expected results in -- for compute volume offerings that were up 7% for the year. We are also continuing to be very focused on our storage business and we saw 15% growth in the business. As we move into fiscal year '19, customers continue to see strong value in our Nimble and 3PAR platforms with HPE InfoSight and are enabling customers to operate more efficiently in our autonomous data center. Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continue to serve a strategic role for our customers. It is a critical piece of our overall offering affording customers flexibility in how they consume technology, and often helping them to unlock value trapped in their own balance sheet. HPE Financial Services' core capability that stands behind our HPE GreenLake model, and every GreenLake contract includes 100% attach of our Pointnext operational services offerings. We are delivering these benefits for customers while growing our financing volumes in achieving a double-digit return on equity. In short, we are becoming more selective in where we are investing for growth and improvements you see in overall margin shows these approaches paying off. Tarek will take you through our Q4 results in a moment. But before I turn the call over to him, let me offer some final thoughts on the opportunity I see for Hewlett Packard Enterprise moving forward. The ongoing explosion of data is powering intelligent edge, creating a $140 billion opportunity. As you know, we have committed to invest $4 billion over four years to capitalize on this market. Meanwhile Hybrid IT market opportunity remained enormous at $185 billion. And we see no end in sight for the mix shift from volume to value. We continue to see great momentum in ongoing shift to hyperconverged and composable infrastructure, which is driving our customers portfolio mix. The other major trend we're benefiting from is customers increasing demand for flexibility, both in terms of how they deploy infrastructure and how they pay for it. By desegregating the hardware and software elements of the infrastructure, we can give customers the cloud experience in economic on-premises with applications deciding where they should run in the most efficient way. HPE GreenLake is a flagship offering here, combining a cloud like experience for on-premises infrastructure, let the customers pay as they go and only for what they consume. To date, we already have more than 400 customers using our consumption based model. We estimate this is over $2 billion of total contract value, including hardware. Along with our HPE Synergy platform, this solutions has our customers decide how they use infrastructure and run the application in the most efficient way. One of the recent development, I want to highlight is the acquisition of BlueData, which takes our consumption model a step further in through AI, machine learning and Big Data analytics. BlueData has developed an outstanding as a services software platform that uses continue technology to make a simpler and more cost-effective to deploy large-scale machine learning and big data analytics environments. It is complementary to our Apollo systems and professional services, extending our data first strategy. By seamlessly combining their software platform with our existing software defined infrastructure and services we will be able to help our customers accelerate their AI and big data transformations and better extract insights from the data, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in a hybrid architecture. Overall, our unique offerings have positioned us right where I want us to be, a powerful force as we show the way customers are generating and utilizing data in their businesses. Across all area of the business, we're putting our customers at the center of everything we do and that\u2019s reflected in our performance, customer feedback, and recent customer wins. For example, we recently support an extensive technique to create a wireless access point for an in-flight entertainment system, utilizing our eight mobile-first campus products. These wireless access point mobile is one of the most advanced in-flight wireless network in the sky. HPE also signed two multimillion dollar contracts, we grew for sometime there in Spain and Mexico. For the deployment of Santander's mobile cloud based on HPE Synergy and we had the significant HPE GreenLake win with Danfoss, the largest manufacturing company in Denmark. Looking ahead to 2018, I\u2019ve a great confidence that we will continue to build on all this momentum. We will continue our work to accelerate growth in Intelligent Edge, deliver profitable growth in Hybrid IT, and balance all of this with continued cost savings from HP Next, a resulting margin expansion. Now before I turn the call over I will like to formally welcome Tarek to his first earnings call as a CFO. As you know by now, Tarek joined us in September 17 and jumped right been quickly getting up to speed on HPE's Strategy and financial commitments so that we can continue to deliver for our customers and partners and rise significant value for our shareholders. Hope many of you have the opportunity to meet and speak to Tarek at the Security Analyst meeting. We're very fortunate to have him on the team and we will continue to benefit from his financial expertise, his customer centric mindset and insight and his industry segment knowledge. Tarek? A - Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. It's a real privilege for me to report Hewlett Packard enterprise quarterly earnings for the first time in my new role as CFO. In my view, there is a great potential at HPE. No other company has the full suite of assets and channel capabilities needed to compete across the extra cloud continue. During the half month into the role, I'm very excited to be part of HPE's leadership team as we got the company and our customers into the next phase of a technology led transformation. But before I share with you our results in detail, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my predecessor Tim Stonesifer for the hard work stands behind HPE strong fiscal year '18 performance and a great handover between us. Now let me share with you our financial results for the quarter. I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight the strong momentum of the business throughout fiscal year '18. Starting with Slide one, you will see that our Q4 financial results were very strong. We ended the fiscal year with robust revenue growth, significantly improved operating margins, better-than-expected non-GAAP-earnings and free cash flow. Our results demonstrate our ability to grow free cash flow by accelerating growth in the Intelligent Edge, driving profitable growth in Hybrid IT and continuing to grow operating profits by expanding operating margins through HPE Next and also by shifting the portfolio mix, higher margin and better services attached offerings. The punch line is that our resulting growth of 49% year-over-year in cash flow from operations demonstrate that our strategy is bearing fruit. From a macro perspective, IT spend continue to be strong and customer demand remains healthy heading into fiscal year '19. The market remains competitive, but pricing remains rational and we are holding onto favorable pricing with improving commodities costs to expand gross margins. DRAM cost have peaked and are starting to come down. NAND prices who are less of an impact on our portfolio continue to decline. Currency drove a 50 basis points tailwind to revenue year-over-year. Having said that, foreign exchange rates continue to move unfavorably in the last couple of quarters. And we now expect currency to be a headwind of closer to two points of revenue growth in fiscal year '19 Looking at Slide 2, total revenue for the quarter was $7.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 3% in constant currency. Top line performance in fiscal year '18 was driven by strong execution in a healthy demand environment that we expect to continue heading into fiscal year '19. Slide 3 and 4 give you a geographic breakdown for the quarter. Regionally, HPE's performance was solid across the globe. Americas revenue was up 3% in constant currency. Core compute, which excludes mission-critical systems and Tier 1 and Intelligent Edge both grew double digits in constant currency. Revenue growth in EMEA continued to be strong, up 8% in constant currency with double-digit growth in the U.K., France, and Italy. Performance in EMEA was robust across all business segments with notable growth in Core Compute at 24% and Intelligent Edge at 14%. Asia-Pacific was down 4% in constant currency due to our focus on profitable share in the China market. Growth in APJ, excluding China was up 2% with solid results across all business segments with notable strength in Core Compute, which grew 18%. Slide 5 shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but the key takeaway is that from a portfolio mix perspective, we're winning where it matters. We maintained robust double-digit growth in our strategically important Intelligent Edge segment. In Hybrid IT, our compute value portfolio grew over 20% this quarter. And within HPE Pointnext, our operational services business grew orders and revenue by 2% in fiscal year '18. Overall, we're confident in sustaining robust revenue growth as we continue pivoting our business towards higher margin, higher value offerings and improve our performance in our services business in fiscal year '19. Turning to margins on Slide 6, we continue to deliver significant margin expansion as a result of focusing on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value, higher margin offerings and continuing to drive HPE Next initiatives. Gross margin of 30.9% was up 120 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin of 10.1% was up 190 basis points year-over-year and 50 basis points sequentially. HPE Next has been an incredible success story for us this year and we expect to continue reaping the operating margin expansion benefits delivered by HPE Next for years to come to drive operating leverage and cash flow growth. Moving on to Slide 7. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.45 in Q4 of fiscal year '18 was above the high-end of our previous outlook of $0.39 to $0.44 per share due to strong operational performance, favorable other income and expense and a lower-than-expected tax rate. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter we exceeded the high-end of our outlook range. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was a $0.52 loss, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.16 to $0.21 per share, primarily related to the impact from U.S Tax Reform which was a drag of over $0.85 to GAAP earnings this quarter. Without the impact, we would have exceeded our outlook on this metric as well. Now turning to the segment and business units, starting on Slide 8. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue was up 17% year-over-year and 15% in constant currency with strength across all regions. Operating margins of 10.1% were down 240 basis points year-over-year due to the ongoing significant investments in sales and R&D as we continue to manage this business for growth and share leadership in the $140 billion Intelligent Edge market opportunity. Aruba product grew 17% with continued strong growth across all product categories, including Campus Switching, Wireless LAN and Edge Compute. We continued gaining share in the Campus Switching business recording seven consecutive quarters of share gain and saw an audible triple digit growth in our Edge Compute business. Aruba services was up 16% on continued installed base growth due to strong attach of our software platform like ClearPass or Secure Network Access Control. As you can see from the revenue mix chart, Aruba services represents today a small portion of Aruba's total revenue, which highlights a great potential for the upcoming years. Moving on to Slide 9, in Hybrid IT, revenue was up 5% year-over-year and up 4% in constant currency. Operating margins were 11.9%, up 210 basis points year-over-year and 130 basis points sequentially in line with our expectations. Compute Revenue was up 9% year-over-year and 14% excluding Tier 1. As a reminder, Tier 1 was over 20% of our compute portfolio couple of years ago and is now under 10%, which is a proof point of our commitment to improving our portfolio profitability mix. Our Compute Value business, which has higher margin and better services attached has continued momentum growing at over 20% year-over-year. This was driven by our hyperconverged portfolio, which includes synergy up triple digits and currently at over $1 billion revenue run rate. Also our high-performance compute category, which was up over 50% and finally mission-critical servers which was up 14%. Revenue growth in our volume business was once again higher than planned in the high single digits excluding Tier 1, driven by strong growth in core rack and tower. Also we continue to drive higher AUPs in total compute, which was up 20% excluding Tier 1 by increasing our mix of Gen10 servers with richer attach configurations maintaining pricing power and to a lesser extent passing through elevated DRAM costs. As expected, unit declines excluding Tier 1 moderated to mid single digits this quarter and we're confident that we can continue to offset moderating unit declines with structural AUP increases heading into fiscal year '19. Storage revenue was up 6% year-over-year as customers embraced our intelligent storage offerings embedded with our AI-based predictive analytics InfoSight platform and we improved our go-to-market execution. Big Data had another strong quarter growing at 92% year-over-year, which will further benefit from a recently announced acquisition of BlueData. Entry storage growth was also solid. Looking forward into fiscal year '19, we are pleased with our full portfolio across Nimble and 3PAR and we expect to gain share in the external storage market. HPE Pointnext revenue declined overall 3% year-over-year due to our continued intentional exit from low-margin countries in the advisory and professional services business, but was flat on our full-year basis and would have been up 1%, normalizing for those country exit. If you look at our higher margin operational services business, revenue was up 2% on a full-year basis. Looking into fiscal year '19, we see continuous growth in operational services orders as we expect favorable mix from our value offerings that have better services intensity and from our consumption based offerings with HPE GreenLake, which grew orders at a 30% year-over-year rate in constant currency this quarter. Moving to Slide 10, HPE Financial Services revenue declined 7% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency due to a large one-time lease buyout deal in the prior year period. Normalizing for this one-time buyout, revenue was up 3% year-over-year. Financing volume remained strong across all regions and was up 8% year-over-year with solid growth in our direct business. Operating margin increased 20 basis points year-over-year to 7.8%. We are very pleased with HPFS performance and look to accelerate its contribution to the business for years to come. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 11, free cash flow was $1 billion in Q4 in line with our expectations and consistent with prior year seasonality. Cash flow from operations growth has been significant in fiscal year '18, driven by HPE Next and shifting our portfolio mix to where we want to win. That is where we have higher margins and better services attached. In fiscal year '19, we expect free cash flow to be $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion as we announced at SAM a significant improvement compared to this year. We also expect our cash flow seasonality to be similar to prior years where the first half is a use of cash with particular emphasis on Q1, and then we generate significant cash in the second half of the year, primarily in Q4. With respect to our capital management strategy and as part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year '19, which we announced in Q1, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. This includes the previously announced 50% dividend increase, totaling $164 million in dividend payments. We repurchased $983 million of shares in the quarter and exceeded our $3.5 billion buyback target for fiscal year '18. Finally, as you can see from Slide 12, our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $3.1 billion. Looking into fiscal year '19, we expect to return approximately $2.9 billion, which is the remainder of our $7 billion capital returns program thus delivering on our commitment to shareholders. Antonio provided our fiscal year '18 performance overview, but let me recap it here now that you\u2019ve seen the quarterly results. Fiscal year '18 was really an outstanding year as you can see from Slide 13 through 16. For the full-year, we grew revenue by 7% year-over-year with notable growth in compute value at 9%, storage at 13%, and edge at 13%. We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 26% and delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 9%, which was up 140 basis points year-over-year and in line with recent communications. We executed well HPE Next, pivoted our portfolio mix towards higher value, higher margin offerings, which came with better Pointnext services attached and grew our consumption based services business. Also we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.56 above our most recent outlook of $1.50 to $1.55 and well above our original SAM 2017 outlook of a $1.15 to $1.25, a growth of over 60% year-over-year from continuing operations. Cash flow from operations were $3 billion, a growth of over 120% year-over-year, while free cash flow came in at $1.1 billion significantly above our fiscal year '17 levels and above our fiscal year '18 guidance. In summary, we're far exceeded our full-year revenue, operating profit, and cash flow commitments outlined at SAM in 2017. This demonstrates that we have the right strategy and our execution remains robust. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17, at our recent Securities Analyst meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '19 and I would encourage you to review representation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. It's worth reiterating a few points for this call. Our top line perspective, we expected to grow our fiscal year '19 revenue adjusted for lower margin Tier 1 business and currency fluctuations. Also we expect to grow our fiscal year '19 non-GAAP operating profit by 6% to 8%. As a reminder, we will be removing nonservice pension costs and benefits from our non-GAAP results. Consequently, our fiscal year '18 non-GAAP EPS adjusted for pension accounting and taxes would be a $1.45. We finished the year better than what we flagged in our 2018 SAM. Looking forward, our fiscal year '19 guidance is unchanged with diluted net earnings per share of a $1.51 to $1.61 for non-GAAP EPS and 8% improvement over the prior year. In our GAAP EPS outlook remains $0.73 to $0.83 per share. Finally for Q1 '19, we expect diluted net non-GAAP EPS of $0.33 to $0.37 and diluted net GAAP EPS of $0.19 to $0.23 per share. So, overall, I'm very pleased with the performance not just in the quarter but the full fiscal year. We have the right vision and execution and the results show that we are winning where it matters. With that, now let's open it up to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. Sorry about the voice. Just two quick questions, I will ask them at once. The first is how would you breakdown the server revenue growth in the quarter between units and ASPs. Then you mentioned a couple times in the call that you expect robust demand that continue into next year. Who are those signals that give you that confidence given everything that's going on in the macro environment. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Hi, Katy. This is Antonio. First of all, I hope you guy will soon -- I will answer the second question first about the macro environment. That is why I\u2019m confident is because we see ongoing demand from customers and their demand is driven by the amount of data we are creating, we are generating. And obviously regulations like privacy, and others, requires that data to be stored, to be managed, to be managed to be curated, and obviously extracted value as soon as possible. So it's a function of the data. And if you look at the charts actually, the data growth outpaces the compute growth, which means that compute growth has to catch-up sooner or rather than later. So from my vantage point, as long as that data continue to grow and I mentioned this before, two years from now we\u2019re going to generate twice the amount of data we generated in human history. That means that data has to be computed and today only 6% of the data has been utilized. The other 94% is not being utilized. So from that point I feel very good and confident about the ongoing demand and we see that in the momentum we have in the last few quarters, and at this point in time, I think that will continue. In terms of the server AUPs, listen, as we said before, is all structural. This quarter actually if you recall two quarters ago, I said as we exit 2018, we will see mitigated declines in units and that's exactly what happened here as being very low single-digit decline in units. And the rest is all structural AUP driven by the mix shift to Gen10, which drives more option attach. And then ultimately the elevated DRAM price is still there, although now started declining. But the fact of the matter is that these servers, this computer platform will continue to add more and more options and therefore, the AUP structural changes are permanent as we go along. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Katy. And we have the next question please. Operator : Yes. Next question will be from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Hi, guys. I wanted to see if you could speak about how you see the trajectory of the server markets, excluding the hyperscale portion you know and then how much this is imposed by the macro and then other factors and just when -- I will just add in there, are you expecting any changes in the competitive dynamics with Dell considering its plan to come back into the public space now. And it's a search in the integration with EMCs is complete? Antonio Neri : Yes, I mean, we have a very deliberate strategy to shift from volume to value, despite that the volume business grew 7% for the year, which is good and our value business grew 20% year-over-year and that's because the software-defined infrastructure is the perfect architecture to deploy on-premises against these specific optimized workload solutions that customers are looking for. When you look at that value business, our HPC business, our high performance compute business grew 25% and that\u2019s driven by the big data analytics and specific segments like government, oil and gas, weather, and academia. If I look at hyperconverged business grow in triple digits. If I look at our synergy business, it grew 280%, but now is already a $1 billion run rate. All these platforms actually drive higher services attach with Operational Services. And so we continued that to -- we continue to believe that\u2019s going to continue to grow. And everything we have gone is deliberated to shift to that model not just from the engineering perspective, but as well as from the go-to-market perspective, because the way we actually incent our people is to go sell solutions that there were load optimize. So I feel very good about that and we expect that to continue whether its on-prem, cloud infrastructure or mission-critical applications. In fact our mission-critical business think about workloads like HANA or SQL, or Oracle. Actually that business grew 35%, which is very, very strong. So I feel good about that. Now in term of the Tier 1 business or the hyperscale, we made our decision almost 2 years ago. And to Tarek's comments, it used to be 20% of the business, now it's less than 10% of the business and we\u2019ve been better delivered about that because there was no margins to be made or least not the one that we wanted to make. And number two there was no services of postal associated with that. So we are certain our strategy and that's what we're executing. Dell, listen I'm focused of my strategy and listen I am very pleased and proud that we\u2019ve done here in the first year with a team, we're growing revenue of the company on the high single-digit. We're expanding profitability by 63% or now earnings per share, we are returning $7 billion of cash or capital to shareholders. And we are validating our strategy with customers every single day. Last week, at HPE discovered in Madrid, we had more than 10,000 customers coming and telling us we are on the right path. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Simon. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Yes. Next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. Two questions, please. First, I\u2019m wondering if you can comment at all on the impact of tariffs. I think as of November 1, you increased pricing on Aruba by 10%. And I'm wondering would you continue to increase price if there were change in tariffs and did you see any kind of pull in, in advance of the price increases that benefited Aruba in the quarter? Could you comment on that, please. Antonio Neri : Yes, Toni. So, yes, we increased prices like any other competitor has done. Remember, in the U.S tariff they were four faces. The first two faces we manage it that was no impact to us. The third face is exactly the one you\u2019re talking about at the 10%. And as you read, the last few days is uncertain what they're going to happen on January 1. We see the outcome of the negotiation. But we increase the prices 10% and we saw no follow-up because of that price increase expected on November 1st. So there was no incremental benefit for Q4. So that's the bottom line. As these new whatever the new tariff comes in play, we\u2019re already working on two aspect of it. One obviously is the pricing side, but the other one is the supplier side. So we continue to work with our supply chain or suppliers to figure out what is the long-term strategic option here, but we need to wait what\u2019s to happen and with the negotiation, because of 10% it makes no sense to change anything. A 25% obviously you have to consider other options. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Thank you for that. And then I\u2019m just wondering, I don\u2019t think you commented on what the or maybe I missed it and I apologize on what the services operational support growth was specifically in Q4? And I understand the move to value, but I was under the impression that support services are largely correlated to unit growth and with unit growth down again mid single digits this quarter and down I think double digits for the year, is it really realistic to believe that high-margin operational services can grow in fiscal '19? And if so, why? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Right. So with respect to the operational services orders, in Q4 they were down as we pulled through some of those orders into Q3. In the course of the fiscal year '18 overall, OS services orders were up 2% as I mentioned in my script. Moving forward to fiscal year '19, Toni, the thing that one has to factor in is what Antonio said with respect to the categories of products that we\u2019re selling, they drive higher services attached. We do expect continues growth in OS services in fiscal year '19 as a result of a shift in the category mix that we are driving right now with our strategy. Antonio Neri : Yes, Toni, another point I want to make is that units is one thing, but also remember the operational services ratio of the, what we call, the intensity rate is a percentage or a correlation to the average unit price of the unit. So you can just use units, right. You have to use the penetration rate and intensity rate associated with that. And as AUP goes up, the reality on the compute side, the reality is that you\u2019re supporting more components in that platform. Therefore the services component of that goes with it as the ratio. So that\u2019s why we are confident that in 2018 our operational services orders or the bookings will continue to grow as we continue to shift through a more blocks of IP, which is value-oriented. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Toni. Can we go on to the next question, please. Operator : Yes. Next question will be from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I want to talk a bit about operating cash flow and free cash flow. Both AP as well as AR were uses of cash benefit from inventory. If you can just talk a bit about some of the moves there. And then how we should think about fiscal 2019? I know you reiterated your guidance, but maybe if you can provide some reminders about what's nonrecurring that hit this year that gives you comfort and the higher guidance for next year or the growth next year? Tarek Robbiati : So you can refer to the presentation and specifically on Slide 11 with respect to the operating cash flow trends versus the total free cash flow trends. The one thing that you wanted me to comment on is the role of inventory in the quarter. We have sold more of our own manufactured products and that's why when you calculate the impact of free cash flow you have to factor in the movement in inventory. The growth in overall operating free cash flow is very, very tangible and the best way to see the sources out for the growth in operating free cash flow is to look at the margin expansion in our operating profits between the first quarter '18 versus the fourth quarter '18 exit. You can observe, for example, that the first quarter '18 we finished OP at $593 million and whereas, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '18 we exit with close to $800 million in operating profit. That was standing behind the growth in overall free cash flow. That is sustainable. That is what is being driven by the HPE Next program. And we keep a tight lid on the benefits and run rate benefits that HP in excess delivered to us. And this is what stands behind the growth that we foreshadowed at SAM in October 2018 for fiscal year '19 and beyond. With respect to the nonrecurring item on free cash flow, there will be more of that in the 10-K that we will file in the upcoming days, but suffice to say that there are recurring charges in the amount of $531 million that we took for the full-year. Some IT costs, some consulting fees that were one offs and other nonrecurring charges, a total of which is about $800 million give or take you'll see all that breakdown in the 10-K that we will file in the upcoming two weeks. Antonio Neri : I will say, Shannon, I mean, we\u2019re very confident about our '19 and '20 guidance as you recall at the Security Analyst meeting we said we\u2019re going to grow 50% free cash flow between '18 and '19, and we\u2019re going to double it by 2020. And that\u2019s because all the leverage that we get through HP Next, the portfolio mix shift, that we talked about it and I will say we have executed and exactly where we committed a year-ago and this year has been really good from that vantage point. Shannon Cross : Thank you. And then can you just talk a bit more about China and some of the pressure you\u2019re seeing there? I'm curious if the declines we saw this quarter on year-over-year basis sort of give us an idea of the magnitude of what you're walking away from to the foreseeable future or what specifically is going on there as you walk later on profitable contracts? Thank you/ Tarek Robbiati : Yes, so let's remind our self with a model for us is in China. We have a joint venture, although we own only 49% of that joint venture and we resell our products through H3C or the new H3C, while the new H3C which is a company that we actually sold to the unit group, couple of years ago. And so they make their own choices right. So they\u2019re trying to balance profitability and growth and there were demand in certain areas of the portfolio including hyperscale as they decided not to participate. So from that perspective, we are actually kind of an [indiscernible], if you will. We just sell through them and they make their own choices. So we work with them on an ongoing basis, because ultimately they are the ones that make those decisions. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Shannon. Can we move to next question please. Operator : Yes. Next question will be from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Pleases go ahead. Paul Coster : Thank you. I wonder if you can just give us a little bit color on the Edge compute growth trajectory, but it's something else. And do you see any cross selling, some synergies with your broader Hybrid IT offerings? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, so the Edge Compute business is growing significantly. This driven by the used cases in specific verticals. We see that the manufacturing that the hospitals as the IoT part of this in the convergence of both the OT, operational technology in IT becomes a reality that's a big advantage that we have. We are one, the only vendors that have a true converge OT and IT platform. And I can tell you it's growing triple digits. And obviously, we expect that to continue to be the case. But more and more is a vertical solution, top to bottom from infrastructure to software to analytics to connectivity and security. And that\u2019s why the combination of Aruba with networking, connectivity, and security with an Edge Compute allows us to provide a full blown solutions for customers. So that that\u2019s what we see at this point in time. And definitely there are dissynergy because all the large deals that we see with Aruba are the reasons that have been through our cross synergy and our go-to-market with Hybrid IT. More and more, we sell an edge to cloud architecture. We sell the campus and branch solutions with Aruba. In verticals we sell Edge Compute and then we sell the cloud. The cloud -- call it on-premises or hybrid, if you will. And in that context, we see the whole pull through. A great example of this is the announcement I made with the Golden State Warriors, although we do it the Formula 1 just to bring it to reality. We provide them the cloud for the factory. We provide them the edge, the circuit and so in other use cases. So it's a big opportunity and its all driven by this experience we need to provide with the edge and the fact you need to extract value and deliver outcomes from the data that generate at the core. And so that\u2019s why I'm very excited about our strategy. Paul Coster : Are there any special incentives around the data center products inside that Intelligent Edge team? Antonio Neri : Yes. So there's a -- definitely there's a compensation that the account manager sells everything. They get paid on selling the full blown solution. And then obviously while you bring the specialist, they\u2019re paid on the specific components of it. But the reality it is cross incentives that goes back and forth, but let's be clear. The edge people are just the specialist people. Really the people who bring to bear the solution and the Hybrid IT people sell everything, edge to cloud. And so, that\u2019s why the strategy is working and more and more pull through for Aruba is happening and the same the other way around, because once you have connectivity, you have to do some sort of processing of data and that\u2019s why we bring the Edge Compute to bear. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Paul. Next question please. Operator : Yes. The next question will be from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. In your prepared comments, you made a reference to some efforts in China that I believe impacted your margins a little bit. Can you just give us some color on what's going on with your efforts there and the margins and the outlook, especially as it relates to who knows what's going to happen with trade wars and stuff, and does this relate at all to H3C, which historically we\u2019ve known or is it something different? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes, no, so again, we don't sell directly in China. We actually moved to this new model almost 3 years ago now and H3C is the sole distributor of HPE products and they represent us in China, but they\u2019re sold as a part of the HPC portfolio and what we are doing like they\u2019re doing is focus on profitable growth. As they focus on the entire portfolio, they pick and choose where they believe is the best thing to do and we\u2019re very happy actually, incredibly happy with the performance of H3C, because as you know we collect dividends and they\u2019ve done really well performance wise. Jim Suva : Yes, what I was getting was more forward-looking is, what you've seen going on is that something we should expect into 2019 or is it a new change from what we\u2019ve heard in the past? Antonio Neri : No, I think it continues 2019, and honestly, listen, China is the second largest IT market now. There are a lot of opportunities, but you\u2019ve to be very focused on where to spend your energy to drive profitable growth, and they\u2019re the ones that make those decisions. As you recall, we\u2019ve actually rights in the governance, because obviously, we are a part of the Board, but the reality is that that market will continue to grow. Then, there will be some seasonality viability quarter-to-quarter depending on the pipeline, but in the end, we believe China is a great market going forward, and we rely on them and very happy with what they are doing. Jim Suva : And just housekeeping, tax rate was lower this quarter, and other income was better, how should we think about for 2019, those items? Andrew Simanek : Hey Jim, so I would refer you to what we said at the Security Analyst meeting. We basically guided other income and expense at a $250 million expense that includes the equity interest. And then if you remember, the tax rate, we basically said from a non-GAAP perspective would be 13%. So I would continue to use those going forward. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. It's greatly appreciated. Andrew Simanek : Sure, thanks, Jim. Next question, please. Operator : Next question would be from Jeff Kvaal with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Jeff Kvaal : Yes. Thank you, gentlemen, for taking the question. I would like to lead off with an Aruba question. Obviously, that's been a source of great strength, both naturally and also some upside. Can you talk a little bit about where you think that strength is coming from? Obviously, there's a decent amount of good IT spending, there's a little bit of a switch refresh under way from your competitors. Does that help and then how much is share gain a factor there? And then, secondly, Tarek, maybe for you, but I think you had mentioned earlier in the script that the FX headwinds had stiffened a little bit for you over the course of the quarter. That doesn't appear to have changed your guidance at all and I'm wondering if you could talk us through that, please. Antonio Neri : Sure. I will take the first question and then Tarek will take the second one. So we continue to see strength in the Aruba business because the reality is the edge is where we live and work and everybody is looking for providing a whole different experience and the mobile first, cloud first approach that Aruba has is actually resonating with customers and allows them to provide these new experiences whereas in hospitals or venues or retail verticals they are looking to provide that connectivity with an application experience that collects data and obviously extracts value out of that data and Aruba is perfectly suited for that because it has a platform driven approach. And that drives switching, it drives the new architecture for wireless connectivity with Wi-Fi 6 that's going to be available here soon and obviously the expansion in through these IoT-led use cases, for example, smart buildings and so forth. That\u2019s why we are so bullish about the business and then when you bring Edge Compute to that platform, then you add incremental capabilities because it is easier to move cloud compute where the data is, not the other way around. That\u2019s what we see and it's all experience driven and architecture we have actually enabled that. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, on FX, good observation. the FX rates have moved somewhat unfavorably relative to the prior month when we were at SAM. When we were at SAM the Euro was trading at about $1.15, and now the new spot rates are pointing to $1.13 trending a little bit lower. Remember, then we said we would face a headwind of one to two points, now it's going to be looking closer to two points for fiscal year '19. That's what we can say at this stage given where the rates are trending. Jeff Kvaal : But Tarek \u2026 Tarek Robbiati : [Indiscernible]. We can change. Jeff Kvaal : All right. Great. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thank you. Next question, please. Operator : Next question will be from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to ask a question about the cash flow. I see that the proceeds from the sale of PP&E almost more or less doubled in the quarter off of last quarter. And I wonder if you could give us any color on what drove that increase and then I have a follow-up to that. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, that is correct. We did have quite a unique transaction during the course of the quarter. There was a -- overall in the year, there's about $400 million of real estate gains and most of which happened in Q4. We effectively sold the campus that we occupy right now in Palo Alto and we're moving into a new location during the course of fiscal year '19, at the beginning of the calendar year of '19. You will see all of that explained and disclosed in our 10-K for greater details, but that's a one-off. We will continue to optimize our real estate, but that is quite a unique transaction that has happened in the fourth quarter. Rod Hall : Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on that, I wanted to -- I know that the underlying business there is -- or at least a lot of that is the leasing business, and I know some of that is HPQ related leasing and I wondered if you could say, what proportion of that leasing business in the financial services arm is related to HPQ and how much is HPE, I just don't really know the split between the two things. Tarek Robbiati : We don't disclose the split of the receivables in financial services between HPE and HPQ, but it has been trending around at the same levels that historical data prior to the split. There hasn't been any major change in that regard, we continue to drive significant growth in volume. We pointed to 8% volume growth in financial services of this year and I am very pleased with how that is going. Rod Hall : Okay, great. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thanks, Rod. I think we\u2019ve got time for one more question, please. Operator : All right. And our last question today will be from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I guess the two questions will be one on storage. Was that 13% year-over-year that's fairly impressive. Can you just talk about what enabled that and how do you think that trends going forward through fiscal '19? And then secondly on Pointnext, I think it was down 3% year-over-year. How much would it be down or what are the extra divestitures, [geos] that you\u2019re exiting from on Pointnext? Antonio Neri : Yes, let me talk about storage first. Listen, I'm very pleased with our performance in fiscal year '18. We grew 8 -- 13% for the full-year, which is faster than the market, so we expect to gain share in external storage and that's driven by a cohesive strategy with both Nimble and 3PAR enabled by a phenomenal platform called HPE InfoSight, which provides predictive analytics for storing and managing that data. And last week I announced that we're extending that platform now to the rest of the on-premises infrastructure including both compute and networking. The customer sees the value of predictive analytics, fix the problems before they happen and obviously now we keep adding features to both the InfoSight and the two platforms both Nimble and 3PAR with the availability of new flash storage and so forth. If you are the hyperconverge part of that on top of storage, well, actually we will be growing almost 20%, 19% and so the combination of different infrastructure for different use cases plus our intellectual property is paying off. And again, we expect that to continue to be the case in 2019 and beyond because we\u2019ve some exciting solutions that are coming to market, and some of them we announced it last week at HPE Discover in Madrid. I don't know, Tarek, you want to talk about the Pointnext question? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, if to add a little bit more color on revenue for Pointnext in the quarter, revenue from operating services was down 1% overall for the full-year it was growing at 2% equally orders for the full-year were growing at 2% and that was reflected in my script as well. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks Amit. I think with that we can close up the call, please. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you for the time and thank you for the questions and I just want to wrap by saying I\u2019m very pleased with fiscal year '18 performance with our growth and expanding profitability and our innovation. I think we make great progress as we transition, and this was all 100% execution driven. 100% of what we did here was about executing our strategy which is clear, and resonating with our customers and partners. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our call for today. Thank you very much. Have a great one.",

Antonio Neri : Thanks Andy. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today we reported another strong quarter for Hewlett Packard Enterprise providing further evidence that our strategy and disciplined execution are driving solid profitable growth. In Q1, we continue to execute against our strategy of accelerating growth in Intelligent Edge and delivering profitable growth in Hybrid IT, through innovation exceptional customer experiences and a commitment to our team and culture. We are on track to exceed most of our fiscal year 2019 financial commitments that we laid out at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October last year. Q1 revenue grew 1% year-over-year when adjusted for the Tier one segments in line with our guidance. Most importantly, we grew significantly in the high-margin value categories like high-performance compute, hyperconverged and composable infrastructure. Our continued mix shift as well as the ongoing cost management and supply chain simplification helped us significantly improve our operating leverage. We improved gross margins by 280 basis points year-over-year. We grew non-GAAP operating profit by 19% year-over-year, well above our 6% to 8% guidance. And we grew non-GAAP earnings per share by 31% to $0.42, well above our outlook of $0.33 to $0.37. All of these drove free cash flow growth of over $200 million year-over-year putting us well on our way to delivering our fiscal year 2019 outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. From a macro perspective, demand remains steady. We continue to monitor the economic uncertainties around the globe, but the overall IT spending environment remains healthy. Our customers tell us the IT investment they are making are critical to driving business outcomes as they look to harness the explosion of data that continues to grow. While the demand environment is helpful, our performance largely reflects our sound strategy, focused execution and software-defined portfolio that is resonating with our customers around the world. Computing at the edge is the next frontier. HPE's unique ability to connect our customers' data between all their edges and all their clouds is a significant differentiator and opportunity for us. That is why we continue to prioritize strategic investments in the Intelligent Edge business. Our Aruba business performed well in Q1. We announced two important new solutions, the Aruba 510 campus access points designed for 802.11ax and the Aruba 8325 switches. The introduction of these new offerings should drive accelerated growth in future quarters. Finally, as you saw in our financial realignments last week, we made an operational change by consolidating our edge data center networking business under Aruba. This will help us even more effectively bring a complete networking portfolio to market. Investments like this will enable us to continue to be the leader in the edge. Turning to our Hybrid IT business, we continue to approach this market in a targeted segmented way. That means, streamlining our go-to-market approach for our volume solutions and investing in high-value software-defined solutions and services. Software is increasingly embedded across all of our value solutions and we continue to drive software innovation both through organic investments and acquisitions. For example, HPE OneView is a software foundation that delivers our composable hybrid cloud vision. It has over 1 million licenses in deployment and just won software product of the year for one of the leading channel publications, so it is clearly resonating with our customers and partners. And HPE OneView is a key factor in synergy success in the market. HPE Synergy is now a $1 billion run rate business since being introduced just two years ago. Another good example is Plexxi which is now incorporated into the composable fabric of our SimpliVity hyperconverged offering. Our hyperconverged portfolio with SimpliVity and synergy grew 17% in Q1. And thanks to our AI software from InfoSight and more recently, BlueData we are offering the most intelligent storage platform on the market. This software is what sets our storage portfolio apart and helped drive the seventh straight quarter of growth. Finally, innovative services like Pointnext GreenLake which offers a consumption model that lets customers pay for what they use continue to resonate with customers. GreenLake orders grew double digits in Q1 and added to HPE's subscription services that drive our recurring revenue and profit. We have recently seen competitors compare their offerings to GreenLake, but the reality is that our solution enabled by software and backed by HPE Financial Services is the only on-prem consumption-driven offering in the market. Beyond GreenLake, Pointnext overall has a strong book-to-bill ratio of 110% in Q1. As we begin to recognize the full benefit of a higher attach rates on our value compute offerings, the go-to-market improvements we have been executing and the completion of the intentional country exit in Advisory and Professional Services we expect to see a positive inflection in revenue in the second half of fiscal year 2019. The investments and focus in differentiated software-defined solutions and services is driving the right mix shift to deliver growth, and expand margins in Hybrid IT. Tarek will get into the details, but I'm very pleased with the progress we have made on improving profitability, and believe there is still more room to grow. Most importantly, our strategy and solutions are resonating with our customers and partners. In Q1, I continue to spend over 50% of my time with our customers and partners and I consistently hear from them how our vision, portfolio and strategy are perfectly suited to lead them through their digital transformation journeys. We continue to win competitive deals due to our differentiated experiences and ability to provide focused portfolio as scale. For example, in Q1 we won a significant new deals with Telefonica in Spain for a technology infrastructure refresh including a transition from traditional storage to an all-flash storage solution. Indiana University selected Aruba for a complete network refresh to support their 109,000 students including indoor and outdoor access points while Switches, ClearPass for security and a way for network management and net insight for analytics and assurance. And Tata Motors recently selected us for a significant technology upgrade including 3PAR and Superdome flex. Finally, I believe to compete and win, we need the best innovation which is made possible by having the best talent. Our people are our future, and in Q1 we continue to invest in making HPE a dynamic place where people are proud to work. We are executing a leadership team in place with focus on recruiting top talent to HPE and improving the engagement of our teams through new employee experiences, training and professional development and community services opportunities. And as you may have seen, we began our move to a new state-of-the-art and custom-built headquarters in San Jose, California, two weeks ago. It showcases our innovative solutions while providing collaborative workspaces for our team. We will host a grand opening in April and I will be excited to welcome customers, partners and all of you to our new home this year. I am pleased with the important progress we have made to transform HPE and I remain incredibly optimistic about our future. Our strategy is on point. The enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud enabled and data-driven. And we are proud to be the Company who can best help our customers connect all their data wherever he lives. Near-term we expect the demand environment to remain healthy and our differentiated software-defined solutions to continue to gain traction with customers driving accelerated revenue growth starting in Q2. Tarek will provide the details, but our confidence in these areas has led us to raise our earnings per share forecast for fiscal year 2019. Longer term, by continuing to execute on our strategy and making important investments in our customers, innovation and our people, I am confident in our ability to deliver strong financial performance and shareholder returns. I look forward to what lies ahead and I hope you share my enthusiasm for both the opportunity and for how well positioned we are to capitalize on it. And now let me hand the call over to Tarek who will provide additional details on the quarter. Tarek? Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. Now let me share with you our financial results for the quarter. As I did before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight the solid start we had in our Q1 to our fiscal year. Starting with Slide 1, you'll see that we are already on track to exceed most of our key financial metrics that we committed to at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Revenue grew in line with guidance while we significantly expanded both gross and operating margins enabling us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share well above our quarterly outlook. This incremental profit and focus on working capital resulted in growing our free cash flow by over $200 million versus the prior year demonstrating that we are executing well and our strategy is resonating with customers. From a macro perspective, despite some ongoing uncertainties around the globe, we continue to benefit from the underlying trends of ever increasing amounts of data and the acceleration of digital transformations that our customers are undertaking. As a result, we have seen IT spending from our enterprise customers remain steady. Looking at foreign exchange rates, they have continued to move unfavorably the last few quarters and we faced a modest headwind in Q1 of 30 basis points. We expect currency will be close to a two-point headwind to revenue growth on a full year basis in FY 2019 based on our current spot rates. Looking at Slide 1, total revenue for the quarter was $7.6 billion, down 2% year-over-year, 1% in constant currency. However, excluding the headwind from our exit of the low-margin Tier one business, revenue grew 1%. Looking forward, we expect the impact from Tier one to become less dilutive to revenue growth towards the end of the year. We also expect the solid enterprise demand environment to continue and our own execution to remain strong all of which should drive accelerated year-over-year growth rates beginning in Q2. Slide two gives you a geographic breakdown for the quarter. America\u2019s revenue was up 1% in constant currency. Core compute grew double digits and Storage grew approximately mid-single digits. Revenue growth in EMEA continued to be strong, up 2% in constant currency with double-digit growth in the U.K. and France. Asia Pacific was down 9% in constant currency primarily driven by revenue declines in the China market. Our HPC partnership there continues to be strong, and we are working to optimize the right mix of HPE product which generates revenue on our P&L with HPC's local offerings to maximize the profit of the overall entity. As a reminder, we recognize our 49% equity interest in our P&L and receive dividends. In fiscal year 2018, we received cash dividends of $164 million from our HPC joint venture and expect to continue to receive similar dividend payments going forward. Beyond HPC, we saw a double-digit growth in our total Asia Pacific region in our Intelligent Edge and Financial Services business. Slide three shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but the key takeaway is that from a portfolio mix perspective, we are continuing to win where it matters. We maintained robust growth in our strategically important Intelligent Edge segment with balanced growth across both wired and wireless LAN. In Hybrid IT, our high-margin value compute portfolio grew close to 20% driven by strength in the high-performance compute which grew over 50% and in hybrid converged offering which grew 70%. Within our storage portfolio, we saw a notable strength in all-flash arrays which grew 20%. Our services business continues to show great potential with a Pointnext book-to-bill ratio of 110% and orders for Pointnext Operational Services including Nimble services growing 2% year-over-year in constant currency. And within HPE Financial Services, we saw strong double-digit growth in our asset management business which is key for unlocking value to our customers and higher margin for us. Overall, we are confident that we can accelerate revenue growth as we continue pivoting our business towards higher margin software-defined offerings and improve our performance in our services business as fiscal year 2019 progresses. Slide four shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 was up 31% year-over-year and well above our previously provided outlook of $0.33 to $0.37 due to strong operational performance, favorable other income and expense and lower-than-expected tax rate and a lower share count from opportunistic buybacks. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter we have exceeded the high end of our outlook range. This outperformance has been driven primarily by the significant improvements we are making in both gross and operating profit margins to drive increased operating leverage. I'll talk more about that in just a minute. As outlined at our Security Analyst Meeting in October, we report our non-GAAP earnings using a structural tax rate based on long-term non-GAAP financial projections. At our analyst meeting, we had indicated that the rate was expected to be 13% beginning in fiscal year 2019. Having received further guidance from the U.S. Treasury, we have now concluded our structural tax rate will be 12% which will be our non-GAAP tax rate for future quarters pending any structural change in our worldwide tax environment. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.13, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share, primarily due to the impact of onetime non-cash U.S. tax reform adjustments as we received incremental guidance on how to apply the new regulations. Turning to margins on slides 5 and 6, we continue to deliver significant margin expansion as a result of focusing on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value, higher gross margin offerings and continuing to drive HPE Next initiatives. Gross margin of 31.1% was up 280 basis points year-over-year and up 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter, the fourth quarter of sequential expansion. Improvements were driven primarily by portfolio mix, supply chain efficiencies, reducing manufacturing overhead and to a much lesser extent, lower commodities cost. Expanding gross margins is very important as it demonstrates that we have a rich portfolio of software-defined offerings of significant value to our customers. Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.9% was up 160 basis points year-over-year. HPE Next has been a great success story for us this year. It has enabled us to make significant investments back into the business including a 20% increase year-over-year in R&D to drive organic innovation. We expect the benefits from HPE Next to continue well into the future enabling investment opportunities and margin expansion benefits that will ultimately drive further cash flow growth. Now turning to the segment and business units starting on Slide seven with the Intelligent Edge. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency led by growth in Aruba services. Operating margins of 1.3% which are seasonally lowest in Q1 were down 390 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing significant investments in sales and R&D. Aruba product grew 3% with balanced growth across both wired and wireless LAN. We expect share gains in wireless and wired which has gained share for seven consecutive quarters. With the new product launches in both wireless and wired switching that Antonio mentioned, we expect to drive accelerated growth as the year progresses. Aruba services went up 20% on a continued installed base growth. We will continue to push high-margin Aruba services to represent higher portion of Aruba's total revenue. Moving on to Slide eight in Hybrid IT, revenue was down 3% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency, but grew excluding Tier one sales. Operating margins were 11.3% up 200 basis points year-over-year, almost at a two-year high level. We're executing well against our strategy of driving profitable growth by shifting to higher gross margin value offerings while improving operating margins across the portfolio with HPE Next. Compute's revenue was down 3% year-over-year, but up 3% excluding tier 1. Most importantly, our higher margin value compute business was up nearly 20%. Our Hyperconverged portfolio which includes Synergy and SimpliVity offerings was up 70%. Our high-performance compute category was again up over 50%, and our edge compute service grew triple digits again this quarter. These trends are indicative that our focus on market segmentation is paying off and we are winning where it matters. Storage revenue was up 3% year-over-year which marks our seventh consecutive quarter of growth. This quarter we saw particular strength in all-flash arrays which grew 20% year-over-year driven by Nimble. Big data also had another strong quarter growing a 25% year-over-year, and we expect it to further benefit from our recently announced acquisition of BlueData. We have also seen significant margin expansion as our customers embraced our intelligent storage offerings. Looking forward, we expect storage revenue to ramp targeting $1 billion per quarter. HPE Pointnext revenue declined 6% year-over-year as expected due primarily to our continued intentional exit from low-margin countries in the Advisory and Professional Services business. This would become less dilutive as the year progresses. More importantly, Operational Services orders including Nimble service orders grew 2% in constant currency. Growth in new attached to our higher-value offerings like Nimble and the increasing adoption of our Flexible Capacity offerings with GreenLake which was up double digits drove the order growth and the strong book-to-bill ratio of 110% in the quarter. These leading indicators give us confidence in the long-term health of the business and we expect an inflection in revenue growth in the second half. Moving to Slide 9. HPE Financial Services revenue was up 3% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency on strength in our higher margin asset management business. Financing volume was down 3% year-over-year and flat in constant currency with an ending net portfolio of assets of $13 billion. Loss ratios also continued to be best in class below 50 basis points. Operating margin increased 40 basis points year-over-year to 8.4% and return on equity was a robust 15.6%. Our Financial Services business continues to play a vital role unlocking value for our customers through our traditional leasing offerings, asset management services and flexible consumption offerings with GreenLake that we will look to accelerate for years to come. Now, turning to cash flow on Slide 10. Free cash flow was a negative $190 million in Q1. This is an improvement of more than $200 million versus the prior year driven by improved working capital management and higher profitability. Q1 is always our seasonally weakest quarter so we are well on our way to achieve our full year outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flow. More importantly, and on an annual basis, we expect working capital to be a contributor to free cash flow generation in the year offsetting some of the restructuring costs of HPE Next, thanks to an improved cash conversion cycle. The cash conversion cycle was a negative 22 days in Q1 as working capital became a source of cash this year compared to the same period last year where it was a use of cash. Moving to capital allocation, as part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year 2019, we returned $1 billion to shareholders during the quarter. We paid $157 million in dividends and repurchased $814 million worth of shares in the quarter that we intentionally accelerated to be opportunistic at lower trading prices throughout the quarter. Finally, and as you can see from Slide 11, our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with an operating Company net cash balance of $2.1 billion. Also, as a reminder the vast majority of our debt is associated with a $13 billion receivable book of our financing business. With less than 50 basis points of bad debt as a percentage of average net receivables, the underwriting performance of HPEFS is best in class. As a result, the level of cash support for HPEFS are minimal which enables HPEFS to generate a high return on financial assets and double-digit return on equity as I mentioned before. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 13, as a reminder, we started the year with a fiscal year 2019 EPS non-GAAP outlook of $1.51 to $1.61 per share. Given our strong non-GAAP EPS performance in Q1 and continued confidence in achieving the full year plan, we are raising our EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect to finish fiscal year 2019 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.66, and we expect our fiscal year 2019 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.88 to $0.98 per share. This is now the fifth consecutive quarter that we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook. For Q2 fiscal year 2019, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.34 to $0.38, and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.19 to $0.23. So overall, I'm very pleased with the performance in the quarter to start the year. We continue to execute well against our strategy and it's clearly resonating with customers as we are making the right bets and winning where it matters. This gives me a great confidence in our ability to accelerate revenue growth in the upcoming quarters with continued margin expansion that will drive our free cash flow and ultimately strong shareholder returns. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead. Ashley Ellis : Hi. Thank you. This is Ashley Ellis on for Shannon. Within Pointnext, I was wondering if you could quantify the drivers of the decline, I think you began exiting or maybe you completely exited several countries around the middle of last year. So I'm wondering what else drove the decline versus the prior two quarters? And how do you plan on stabilizing that business? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thank you for the question, this is Antonio. I'm going to start and I'm going to give it to Tarek. So first of all, let's recap Pointnext, which we are pleased with our bookings performance which as Tarek said in the Operational Services business grew 2% year-over-year, but when you look at the book-to-bill ratio which is the orders that we take now against the current revenue period or the current period revenue and you think about the future which is basically translate those orders into revenue, that was 110% which is very, very strong. On the Advisory and Professional Services in your question, we started last year as a part of HPE Next and will be done sometime at the latter part of this year, and we are as I said earlier in my HPE Next commentary is the fact that we are really refocusing Advisory and Professional Services in fewer countries so we can make big investments where we can drive the pull through above our software-defined infrastructure, our Intelligent Edge and the attach that goes with it. So instead of being in 170 countries, we're going to be in fewer countries, and that work is well underway and that's the declining revenue that we saw in Q1. But as I said in my remarks, we see that inflection point to start happening in the second half of 2019. Tarek, I'm not sure if you want to add anything on that. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you, Antonio. I would simply add by highlighting the fact that under the umbrella of Pointnext, we have essentially two types of businesses. We have the Pointnext Operational Services business which is a maintenance business across all our installed base and our customers; and we have also the A&PS business which is by and large a consulting business that we run globally. To answer your question Ashley most of the decline in revenue, was driven by A&PS and this is the fruit of decisions we made with respect to country exits. The order book on Pointnext Operational Services is working well. We're very confident with the order levels that we've seen across Pointnext Operational Services and Nimble services in the quarter, and the book-to-revenue ratio, the book-to-bill ratio, the 110% is pointing to long-term revenue generation by this business unit. Antonio Neri : The only thing I will add Ashley since you asked the question, remember one of the key components of that Operational Services portfolio is also HPE GreenLake, which grew double digits, and to give a size of that business for you to understand it, we already have more than 450 customers under that type of contract. The TCV value of that over the period of time is already over $2 billion and this business is going to be close to $1 billion run rate business for us in year. So we are very excited about that because I made the comments in my remarks that it's the only on-prem true consumption-driven offering on the market. Ashley Ellis : Thank you. That was very helpful. Maybe we could go further into that thing. Could you detail the margin profile between the operational business and the advisory business, and maybe how you see margin improving over time? And that is it from me. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : I'm glad you're asking the question. So the richest margin revenue stream is Pointnext operating services. A&PS is a lower margin, but still very profitable for us compared to Operational Services. Operator : The next question will be from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. This may be a difficult one for you to answer, but I wanted to see if you had some thoughts on why one of the other peers within the IT space has talked about weakness in January following a decent close to calendar 2018, and it sounds like your view on the overall IT spending trends are fairly stable and no particular weakness apart from some of the international challenges that are ongoing not new. Can you may be shed some light on why you might see the world differently? Antonio Neri : Sure. I mean I'm going to comment for us not for the other vendors. Listen, from a macro perspective the demand remains steady, and obviously we continue to monitor the economic uncertainties driven by global trade and Brexit and others, but our demand was very steady throughout the quarter, and people ask me questions like the government shut down had an impact to the U.S. business, the answer is no, zero. In fact, one of the elements of the portfolio we serve to the government is the high-performance compute, and I can tell you our high-performance compute in that segment in the government grew triple digits. When you ask me about Brexit, our business in U.K. grew double-digits, and in China we have an unique set up which Tarek made the comment about our joint venture with a Chinese partner in a company called new HPC. We at this point in time, I always talk about this from the customer point of view, we see customers accelerating their digital transformation, I talk about all the time about the explosion of the data around that. That data is outpacing the compute power, but that compute is shifting. It's not just in the cloud. It's moving to the edge, and that's why I talk about the ability to provide the cloud computing at the edge, and that's why our edge computing platforms grew triple digits this quarter. So we may have a different portfolio, and maybe we may have different focus on the segment, but we saw no slowdown in our demand in Q1, and that's why, together with our portfolio and our sound strategy, we are very confident to accelerate growth in revenue in Q2 and beyond, and that's why we also raised the EPS guidance. Operator : The next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I just want to reconcile the increase in guidance with what appeared to be some non-operating benefits, so I'm hoping you can just correct me if I'm misspoken and then reconcile it. So by my calculations, other income was a $0.045 benefit this quarter relative to your prior guidance. Tax rate now at 12% for the year is about a $0.02 benefit. So those two alone are $0.065 and you raised in guidance $0.05. Additionally, relative to my model, unallocated stock-based compensation was down $25 million year-over-year, that helped $0.02. So if I add these three factors, it's $0.085 which are all effectively non-operating, and yet you're raising guidance by $0.05 despite the fact, they sound very positive on fundamentals. Am I misspeaking on any of the factors? And how do I reconcile that? And I have a follow-up please. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. I think Toni your math doesn't work. The improvements in operating profit is driving the vast majority of the growth that is tend to be behind our guidance change. Yes, there is some benefits from tax, but the difference is not going to drive more than $0.01 and a little bit more potentially from our math. The OI&E improvement is also a function of two things. There is the interest expense side that we are managing and keeping under control, and there's also dividends from China that we explained and continue to [indiscernible]. That is responsible for $0.01 or $0.02. On the whole, the real driver of operating performance is the expansion in gross margin. We expanded gross margins 280 basis points year-over-year, and that is really the key acid test in my mind in the way we want to look at the business moving forward. With HPE Next also driving higher levels of efficiencies from an OPEC standpoint, and this is why you can see a pretty large improvement in overall operating margins which are now at 8.9% in Q1, up from 7. 3% in Q1 last year once you've normalized for the pension adjustment. So it's 160 basis points improvement year-over-year in operating margin overall. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Thank you, Tarek, maybe you can just provide updated guidance for interest and other, it was minus $250 million for the year, what's the updated guidance then? And then separately for my follow-up, edge compute did extremely well, that's new to the segment. So I'm trying to understand the growth trajectory of traditional compute. So I think traditional compute was probably minus five or minus six, if we exclude edge compute, maybe you could help us with what server units grew and what server ASPs did in the quarter. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Okay. So let me take the first part of the question and I will ask Andy to shed some light on edge compute versus compute growth. And Antonio will add to that. Fair question on OI&E. We did -- and you're correct in guide at the SAM meeting at the Securities Analyst Meeting to a $250 million expense for the full year. We don't give specific new guidance at this stage on this line item, but it's true that we did have some outperformance relative to what we guided on a full year basis in the course of Q1. And we expected to beat on the $250 million, but even if you were to think the $250 million in terms of overall EPS impact, the impact will be relatively small relative to the original guidance that we gave at SAM. Andy and Antonio? Antonio Neri : Yes. So on the server side, Tony a couple of things, our value compute grew 20% in aggregate, and you saw some of the commentary around the software-defined infrastructure with hyperconverged growing 70% and high-performance compute growing 50%. And obviously we are an extended Tier one business right which that continues to be now a less of an impact for us, but if you look at the growth of compute overall it was minus 3, but if you excluded the Tier 1, it's plus 3%. So we expect that headwind to continue to be less and less, because obviously we continue to deplete that specific segment. On the edge side, it's still relatively small in our overall basis, but we are very encouraged about the momentum because we're growing triple digits, and that will continue to be the case. And the reason why that's the case Tony is because we see the growth of that cloud closer when the data is created, and we see new use cases in manufacturing, transportation and health care. And the embedded compute in those platforms plus the cloud closer where the data is a better economics for customers in many of the use cases. So that's what we see today. From the AUP perspective, our AUP continue to grow, and that's a function of the fact that we said many times that two-third of the AUP is structural because as you know the commodity costing has been declining, and it takes longer time to pass that through, but the reality we continue to grow AUPs roughly 20% which is a function of what customers are buying which is configurations related to AI and big data analytics and other software-defined infrastructure. So that's what we see Toni at this point in time. Operator : The next question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you, good afternoon. Can I just come back to the guidance question, because you beat in the quarter by $0.07, you're raising by $0.05 which assumes that there is a $0.02 headwind that hits in the following quarters. Is that what is that headwind? Or are we thinking about that wrong? Is there just conservatism baked into the guidance? Then I have a follow-up. Tarek Robbiati : All right, it's true, Katy, we beat by $0.07 and we gave back $0.05 by way of guiding guidance improvement. This is only Q1, we have three quarters to go, we want to accelerate growth and give me $0.02 to be able to do that. Katy Huberty : Okay. And then as a follow-up, R&D as you mentioned is up strong double digits year-on-year. Can you just talk through the projects that are receiving the most incremental investment? Is that all going to the Intelligent Edge investment over multiple years that you've talked about, or are there other areas of the business where you are seeing a significant step up in investment? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Sure Katy. So one point I want to make on the previous question is the fact listen we need to manage the Company for the long term, and obviously we continue to accelerate investment where we see the opportunity to grow and deliver shareholder value. So to Tarek's point this is just Q1 and we see opportunity to accelerate some investments. To that question that Toni asked the Intelligent Edge is absolutely an area that we continue to invest. And you saw in the numbers right, that we are growing, but also reinvested significantly back into the business. And in that think about the connectivity aspect of this as 5G comes online, there is an opportunity to integrate 5G into the overall control plane and data plane that will provide customers within Aruba platforms. Think about the cloud computing and the edge we talked earlier, and then in the core business right for us it's all about software embedded in our solutions because customers want a workload-optimized solution on prem that they can connect to a cloud in a very efficient way. And all of that is going through software, and as you think about that is the private cloud on premises with the right consumption model, with the right simple aspects of the experience to provision and manage that infrastructure? And we feel very good about that. That's why Synergy is a billion-dollar run rate business for us. And when you think about Synergy 95% of that business or the platform is software. That's why HPE OneView now is the foundation to deliver that composable cloud and the hybrid cloud vision, and that's why there's already more than 1 million licenses deployed. So think about core, all about software AI, machine learning to automate everything and to make that Hybrid IT experience simple, and on the edge really the edge compute connectivity and security, and obviously services, services for us is very, very significant and the consumption model is one aspect of that. Operator : The next question will be from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Jeff Kvaal : I'm afraid I'm going to have to start with clarifying that guidance one step further. And that is if I'm interpreting your remarks correctly the gross margin improvement that you've got in this quarter is sustainable. But you may choose to increase your OpEx a little bit more to pursue some of these growth opportunities and that's why the full year guidance isn't going up. Is that right? Tarek Robbiati : No. Jeff look the gross margin improvement of 280 basis points is sustainable. But in my speech I've explained the sources of that improvement which have to do with supply chain efficiencies improvement such as logistics cost manufacturing overhead cost reductions and also to a much lesser extent the improvement in commodities cost. The mix is the fundamental point that drives the improvement in gross margins. It's not just the cost of sales but the mix of the revenue drives the improvement in gross margins. This has caused us to beat guidance in this quarter by $0.07. This is the first quarter of the fiscal year. We see potential. I talked to many customers to continue to grow and accelerate growth starting Q2. And so we are going to make a limited amount of investments to go and pursue that growth moving forward. Antonio Neri : And to be clear that investment is again in the areas I talked earlier before is all about accelerating innovation accelerating innovation based on the customer feedback which feedback i s our strategy is sound and is resonating with them. Our HPE Next actually gives us the operating leverage together with our mix shift to make some of those choices. Jeff Kvaal : Okay that makes so much sense. And your gross margin commentary Tarek what's clear is it's more of an OpEx question. And I also ask on the Aruba side of things your product seems like you got some new products 11ax upgrade. Should we expect that to bring Aruba back towards a more traditional growth rates in next quarter or over a series of quarters? Or how should we think about that? Antonio Neri : Yes absolutely. We are incredibly excited about the new offering that Aruba brought to market here Aruba 510 access point that to your point now are going to deliver this new experience with the 802.11ax which improves bandwidth and improve the overall experience. As you know Aruba is the software platform that provides a mobile-first cloud-first approach. And these access points are actually going to enhance those experiences. And the 8225 switches are the next iteration of programmable switches that ultimately take advantage of these newer capabilities and we expect that to accelerate growth. Listen the Aruba portfolio the wireless LAN grew double digits and that's great. But as you know when customers see this new technology they also want to take advantage of it. And also in the United States you have programs like and all those that come to play. And so I know there was another question before that didn't come up but since I'm here I'm going to answer proactively. It was the Q4 deals have an impact to the Q1? The answer is no. It's just normal seasonality and our bookings and Aruba products are incredibly strong. So this is just about converting the bookings to revenue and then take advantage of these new offerings which are super super bullish. Operator : Next question will be from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : I just wanted to come back to the AUP comment. I think you had said that AUP is up about 20% for service and I wonder if you can give us the other side of that equation the unit decline number. And then I have a follow-up and that relates to that geographical revenues in the guidance. We see this big deterioration in Asia Pacific which you called out as China. I wonder if you could talk about whether that in your estimation is declining further? Or whether that's relatively stable at this point. And maybe simultaneously at EMEA if you could just comment on what you think forward trends look like there. Tarek Robbiati : Sure Rod. I'll take a quick grab at the units and AUP question. So as Antonio mentioned AUPs were up again about 20% or so this quarter. And so you can kind of back into the unit numbers that they were down similar to what we saw last quarter. So no major change in the dynamic because obviously compute excluding Tier 1 grew 3%. So I think the important thing that Antonio mentioned was we've got enough structural AUP uplift to continue to drive overall growth in core compute. So no major change from that dynamic perspective. And maybe Antonio I'll let you take the Antonio Neri : Yes I don't want to make a comment on that because remember the units that have been declining is the units that have no attach to Pointnext. That's what I really want to emphasize versus the units are growing are the ones that drive the attach to Pointnext Operational Services which are they're value units whether it's high performance compute or hyperconverged and others. And that's why those businesses that are growing whether they're growing 50% or 70% with AUP of increase of 20%. The reality is that drives the night attach and that's why our book-to-bill ratio was 110% and that's why our Operational Services business grew as well. So that's why I want to emphasize that because they two hand-in-hand versus the volume commoditized which is a big churcn for the unit decline was the Tier one and no implication to Pointnext. In terms of China as I said before we have a unique setup there. But Asia Pacific without China grew again and that's what is important and it grew double digits. But in China because we are set up they have a combination of a portfolio of HPE products and Chinese products. As you can imagine selling in that market is not linear in uniform because when you saw the government right they would like you have more Chinese products versus selling in the traditional commercial space. But in the end we don't are not concerned at all because in the end we have a 49% stake that delivers very nice dividends. And we are driving that upside together with our shareholders because we pass those dividends to our shareholders. And so I want the community to understand that that business as a whole is growing but the mix within that business is shifting. But the reality is we pass the benefit of that growing business to the dividend side. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. If I can just at a commentary on this one because it's really important to understand our setup in China. Look most companies who set up a business in China most Western companies typically set it up with a special purpose and they call the Chinese partner and both parties put their assets and know how to work with a joint venture to succeed. Very few players across all sectors have a 49% stake in the substantial operational China. We do. If you really want to look more at our Chinese business you have to refer back to the parent company UNIX which is listed in China and see how much of the profit of our HPE joint venture contributes to the total profit pool of UNIX. So the setup for us is optimal and what we're trying to do is to manage the operations as Antonio said through the mix of products to maximize profits and dividend payouts. Rod Hall : And maybe a comment in Europe? Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Europe was actually the best-performing region I would say. when you think about that. And we have very strong growth in many of the geos within Europe. I mean I made a comment about Brexit early on that our U.K. business grew double digits. So France, so Germany. We are very strong momentum in Europe. And I think our portfolio considering how business is done there and how customers adopt new technologies is incredibly suited for that market. So overall we are very pleased with Europe. They grew 3% year-over-year. And then that you have others in the Central European countries that I talked about our Advisory and Professional Services. But the core business and the Operational Services business grew very nicely. And we see an expansion with Aruba too. Operator : It will be Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Look congrats on a solid quarter. Hey just going back to the revenue acceleration commentary you guys mentioned revenue acceleration coming starting in the second quarter a handful of times across a handful of segments using a handful of contacts. I know the growth kind of forecast for the fiscal year was really just for growth. But I would love c ontext you probably all would just on how you want us to sort of think about revenue acceleration because that will sort of suggest something greater than just nominal growth. And so how should we think about that? It also sounds like you're talking about investing in the upcoming growth opportunities too. I think the word amplified was used as well. So any context there would be fantastic. Tarek Robbiati : Okay. Let me try and add a little bit of color for all of you to understand this point. We did say and we guided that we would be growing revenue for the full year. There is no change to that. However there were a couple of dynamics that we also flagged to you. Number one currency. We still expect a 1% to 2% of headwind from currency. It's closer to 2% rather than 1%. and there's also good Tier one dynamic. The Tier one revenue decline has diluted our growth profile. What gave us now more confidence that we can grow as of Q2 is because we have seen the Tier one decline being sharper than what we originally anticipated which reduces the dilution effect for the subsequent quarters. And that's why we made a commentary overall that we can see acceleration of revenue from Q2 Q3 and Q4. And finally and most importantly what really is driving this level of confidence is all the discussions we're having with our customers who are reiterating that their plans continue at pace. And that's why we qualified the macro environment by saying it is steady. Antonio Neri : I will add one thing to that point here is that we see again the explosion of the data as a driver to drive growth. Our high-performance compute portfolio is best in class and we see the momentum accelerating. Aruba will continue to accelerate starting Q2 and beyond because of new offerings and also because how demand shapes throughout the year. And obviously our software-defined portfolio clearly is resonating with customers. That together with the comments that Tarek made about the Tier 1 we actually very very confident that our Q2 and beyond our revenue will accelerate from the current levels. And that's why together with our mix and together with our cost disciplined execution we are confident to raise the guidance. And as I said in my comments I think there are more opportunities here to continue to drive that shareholder value. And again our innovation is the best we ever had. The employee morale in the company is the best we've ever had. We just moved to a new headquarters here which is phenomenal. And we are winning in key segment of the markets where we decide to focus on. So that gives us the confidence that we can accelerate revenue. Ananda Baruah : And just a real quick follow-up. That does that hold to your channel business as well which is a significant portion of your revenue? You mentioned enterprise. You gave some enterprise context earlier but for your channel business as well. Antonio Neri : Yes absolutely because if the channel doesn't grow we can't grow. So 70% of our business in the core Hybrid IT and up to 90% in Aruba are all driven by the channel. And in fact the more I will be talking to the channel partners about our momentum and our innovation to all the key seals in there with us. So they like unpredictable channel program so they can understand how to make money with us. But ultimately they like our portfolio to serve our customers better. So our sellout in the channel has grown double digits and that's why we are confident. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you Ananda. And thank you everyone else for joining the call today. With that I think we can wrap things up. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining.

As mentioned the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and it is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call. With that let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q2 performance reflects our continued progress on shifting our portfolio to higher margin products and services to deliver positive and consistent earnings growth. As a result of this focus, we delivered strong growth and operating margin improvement, expanding non-GAAP EPS and grew cash flow versus the prior year. We also made a number of bold strategic moves to drive innovation, strengthen our culture and win new customers. While our Q2 revenue growth was impacted by a combination of both intentional and unanticipated factors, we delivered on our [some] [ph] commitment to grow revenue, and we are raising our EPS outlook for the year. In Q2, we deliver revenue of $7.2 billion, up 1% year-over-year excluding the Tier 1 sales and the currency impact. We grew in key businesses, including storage, high-performance compute, composable cloud, Aruba services and GreenLake orders. Strength in these areas partially offset continued intentional declines in Tier 1 sales and sales into China, as well as some market and execution factors, which I will talk more about in a minute. As we shifted the mix of our portfolio toward higher value solutions, our underlying profitability improved across the board. Our gross margin of 32.2% expanded 200 basis points and our non-GAAP operating margin of 8.9% was up 70 basis points year-over-year. All of this combined with favorable OI&E drove a strong non-GAAP EPS performance of $0.42 well above the midpoint of our outlook and positive free cash flow of $402 million, up over $650 million versus the prior year. From a macroeconomic perspective, we continue to see global demand driven by the need to process ever-growing amounts of data. However, like others in the industry, we did see some changes in market dynamics. For example, trade tensions are creating uncertainty. We continue to believe that an open market where everyone can innovate and participate is important for market stability and customer confidence. We also recently experienced an elongation in sales cycles with some customers. We will continue to monitor these and other microeconomic factors. By business segments, I will start with Intelligent Edge. We continue to see the Edge as a significant opportunity for the company, the explosion of data, devices and apps is driving strong demand for connectivity, security, analytics and cloud computing capabilities of the Edge. Given our strong portfolio and ongoing investment in this business, we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend over the long-term. In Q2 Intelligent Edge revenue was $666 million, down 5% year-over-year. We saw solid growth in EMEA and APJ and in Aruba services and we won new customers and introduced new compelling products. This positive momentum was offset by some unexpected execution issues and changes in market dynamics. We uncovered some uneven execution in North America, mainly driven by our current sales coverage model, which we are actively addressing. From a market perspective, we experienced some deals not closing in the timeframe we anticipated. While we will continue to monitor the demand environment closely we are confident in our position going forward based on the new customer wins we closed and the positive reception to the products we introduced this quarter. For example, we won a deal with C&S Wholesale Grocers, the largest wholesale grocery supply company in the United States, with 14,000 stores in 50 locations. C&S selected Aruba wireless solutions to address its network and security needs. McKesson Corporation, a global healthcare leader currently ranked sixth on the Fortune 100 will be deploying Aruba's wire and wireless infrastructure. And, Amherst College updated its entire campus network with Aruba's solutions. We continue to invest in key capabilities like AI and security. For example, in Q2 Aruba introduced two new offerings to help enterprise customers simplify the adoption of IoT by eliminating security and connectivity barriers and decreasing associated operational costs and complexities. Aruba ClearPass Device Insight delivered a single pane of glass for device visibility, employing automated device discovery, machine learning based fingerprinting and identification. And new access points built on the industry's most advanced family of Wi-Fi 6 IoT ready access points. We expect these new solutions and additional introductions later this year to contribute to growth in our Intelligent Edge segment in the long-term. Turning to Hybrid IT, we delivered revenue of $5.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, excluding Tier 1. Our segmented approach and investment in high value products and as a service offerings are paying off. We saw continued strong performance in key areas of the business, including storage up 5% year-over-year, high performance compute up 25% year-over-year, hyper converged up 25% year-over-year, and composable cloud up 78% year-over-year. Our ability to offer all of this technology as a service is a key differentiator for HPE. We are the only company on the market that can provide a true consumption driven offerings in a hybrid cloud environment. HP GreenLake is a key element of our push towards subscription based revenue, which also includes Aruba services, and other software defined solutions. GreenLake continues to see very strong customer momentum and recorded its largest quarter ever, with orders that grew 39% year-over-year. This contributed to our overall HP Pointnext performance, which exited the quarter with a book to build ratio of 1.12 highlighting the potential for future revenue growth. These growth areas offset the impact from some unexpected market dynamics and execution, as well as the intentional decline in Tier 1 sales and revenue coming from our H3C relationship in China. From a market perspective, we saw extended sales cycles, which indicates a slightly softer demand environment from what we saw earlier in the quarter. And like the Intelligent Edge, although to a lesser extent, we did not execute as well as we could have in North America. We are taking steps to improve our execution including realigning our sales coverage in specific segments of the market. Separately, as we have discussed in prior quarters, while our H3C partnership continues to be strong, we are working to balance the right mix of HP products with H3C local offerings to optimize profitable growth for the overall entity. This had some impact on our revenue in Q2, which Tarek will talk more about in a minute. In Q2, we continue to attract new customers and partners. For example, we won a significant technology and services deal with electrical utility company, Southern California Edison, as they upgrade all their customer facing applications. We also expanded the HP GreenLake ecosystem by announcing a strategic global partnership with Nutanix to provide customers with more choice for building their hybrid cloud strategy. We also announced a similar partnership with Google Cloud. These partnerships show the growing understanding and acceptance of the fact that the world will be hybrid. From an innovation standpoint, we are continuing to invest in BlueData, which we acquired early this year. In Q2, we announced a new integrated offering that combines the HP BlueData software platform with the HP Apollo System and HP Pointnext services to provide customers with a powerful solution for AI and data driven business innovation. Finally, we are very excited about our intent to acquire Cray. As you know Cray is a premier provider of high end supercomputing solutions. I believe this acquisition will position us to tackle the most data intensive workloads in the high growth segment of high performance computing. HPC has been and continues to be a strategic focus area for HPE, and one where we have the clear differentiation. Over the years, we have invested organically to build a strong portfolio and completed acquisitions, including SGI to take advantage of the rapidly growing demand for powerful computing capabilities. With its leading presence in the government, academic, life science, energy and manufacturing segments, Cray will bring complementary technology and end markets to further strengthen our position. Customer benefits will include new offerings in AI, machine learning, analytics and new consumption models with HP GreenLake in the near future. Together, the companies can achieve greater scale by combining engineering talent and technologies and enabling R&D innovation leadership. We will also have enhanced supply chain capabilities with its improved U.S. based manufacturing. So overall, I couldn't be more excited to have Cray join the HP team once we close the deal in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Just as we are investing in bringing innovative offerings to the market, we also remain committed to thoughtfully investing in our own culture. I believe attracting and retaining the best people is critical and our renewed focus on culture is bringing energy to our employees and attracting new attention from recruits. The day we celebrated our official grand opening in San Jose last month, we also launched several new employee benefits, including six months of paid family leave for the birth or adoption of a new child. I believe strongly in supporting both the career and personal development of our people, and I am proud of the new ways we\u2019re able to do so. In summary, I am pleased that we delivered strong margin improvements, EPS above our outlook and robust cash flow in Q2. While we experienced some changes in microeconomic dynamics, and could have executed better in certain areas. We are on track to deliver on our commitments we laid out the SAM. I am excited about our future as we continue to deliver what customers need most. Our strategy at the Edge is to provide connectivity, security, analytics and cloud computing. At the core, we provide workload optimize, cloud enable and consumption driven solutions for a hybrid world remain confident that our execution against this strategy will drive profitable growth and solid free cash flow generating strong shareholders returns. With that, I would like to turn it now to Tarek. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. Now, let me provide more detail on our financial results for the quarter. As I did before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight our performance in the second quarter of our fiscal year. Starting with slide one, you'll see as Antonio said that we are on track to deliver our key financial metrics that we committed to at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Revenue grew in line with our commitment at SAM for constant currency growth excluding Tier 1. We continue to expand both gross and operating margins, enabling us to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share above our quarterly outlook. Most importantly, the quality of our earnings is improving. This has enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $402 million in Q2 and $212 million in the first half. This is the first time, we've achieved positive first half free cash flow as Hewlett Packard Enterprise since the company was spun-off from the Hewlett Packard Company in November 2015. Now let me take this opportunity to explain our revenue growth story in this quarter, as shown on slide two. This quarter, we continue to take deliberate actions to improve our profitability. We continued the wind down of our Tier 1 business. The business made up 5% of our total revenue in the prior year, and is now just under 2%, but at a much better gross margins. And as Antonio mentioned, we are selling fewer HPE products to our HPC business in China in order to optimize our HPC joint venture for profitable growth. I will talk about China and the HPC entity there in more details shortly. Currency was also a greater headwind to revenue this quarter. As you can see, after adjusting for deliberate actions in currency, the underlying core business is growing, driven by our strategic focus area. Turning to the macroeconomic environment, I'll start with China. As you see on slide three, China continues to be an important market for us as the largest and fastest growing IT market in the world. We have a strong presence in China through a very unique structure with HPC, where we own a 49% equity stake, and UNIS owns the other 51%. UNIS is an $8 billion market cap company listed in China. UNIS derives the vast majority of its profits from H3C. As mentioned earlier, we continue to focus on balancing the amount of HPE products versus HPC\u2019s local offerings to optimize the overall entity for profitable growth. While selling fewer units to HPC does impact our revenue, keep in mind that we sell product at preferential prices to HPC. As a result of the balancing, we are recognizing higher equity interest year-over-year in the OI&E line of our non-GAAP P&L for which we receive regular cash dividends. HPC\u2019s performance which is operational in nature is an important component of the OI&E results in our non-GAAP P&L. Also since the beginning of this month of May 2019, we have the right over the next three years to exercise our put option to sell all or part of our 49% stake to UNIS. The put option is valued at 15 times trailing 12 months net earnings. It's worth noting that the publicly traded shares of UNIS are trading at a much higher multiple than the multiple of our put option. However, we do not currently intent to exercise our put at this time, given the strategic importance of the China market, and HPC\u2019s growing revenues and earnings. Moving on to a broader view of each global region on the right hand side of slide four, we did witness some shifts in market dynamics, with global trade often mentioned as a concern by our customers. We are taking actions ourselves to mitigate the risks of the recent tariff increase from 10% to 25%, and have factored that into our outlook. Moreover, foreign exchange rates have continued to move unfavorably the last few quarters, and we faced a significant year-over-year headwind in Q2 of 210 basis points. We now expect currency to be close to a two point headwind to revenue growth on a full year basis in fiscal year 2019, based on current spot rates instead of just over 1 point as stated at SAM in October 2018. Geographically, Americas revenue was down 7% in constant currency or down 2% when normalizing for Tier 1 sales. Revenue growth in EMEA was up 1% in constant currency, with solid double-digit growth in both France and Germany. Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant currency, and up 6% in constant currency excluding China. Slide five shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In Intelligent Edge, we had solid performance in both EMEA and APJ, but as Antonio mentioned, we have some go to market execution issues in North America that we are working through in the coming quarters. In Hybrid IT, our higher margin value compute portfolio grew at 8% and within storage, we saw notable strength in nimble storage, which grew 45%. In Operational Services, we grew orders again, including nimble services. And within HPE Financial Services, we saw solid single digit growth in our asset management business, and continued strength in return of equity, which again exceeded 15% this quarter. Let me bring everything together on slide six and put into perspective the key metrics to measure our business as we pivot our portfolio. The left hand side of the chart shows how the various businesses within Hybrid IT contributed to HPE\u2019s overall revenue growth. First, it is important to separate out our deliberate actions in both Tier 1 and China that diluted growth by 4 points combined. The volume compute business remains stable contributing 20 basis points to growth and more importantly, our higher margin value compute business grew 8% contributing 1.2 points to overall growth. We are seeing strong growth in these categories with HPC up 25%, contributing 1.5 points, composable cloud of 78%, contributing 1.3 points and HCI up 25%, contributing another 20 basis points. Storage also was up 5%, contributing 60 basis points to overall growth. While Pointnext revenue was down in the quarter, we\u2019re growing operational services orders including nimble services at 1% year-over-year, and GreenLake subscription services which were up 39%. These are both important lead indicators to overall future Pointnext revenue growth. This portfolio mix shift combined with supply chain efficiencies and improvements in manufacturing overhead drove margin expansion of 200 basis points year-over-year in Q2. Roughly two thirds of that was driven by the mix shift and the remaining one third was other costs of sales efficiencies including lower commodity costs. We have also been able to hold non-GAAP operating expenses relatively flat through our continued savings and investments from HPE Next. As a result, non-GAAP operating profits continue to expand and were up 70 basis points year-over-year in Q2. All of this has resulted in significantly improved non-GAAP EPS. We're also focused on working capital, and we have been able to decrease our one-time payments for HPE Next. As a result, Q2 cash flow from operations was $1 billion, up 300% versus a prior a year. The key takeaway is that our underlying profitability and quality of earnings is materially improving. Slide seven shows our EPS performance to-date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 was up 31% year-over-year and above our previously provided outlook of $0.34 to $0.38 due to solid operational performance and favorable other income and expense. OI&E was favorable due to lower interest expense, favorable currency hedging, stronger earnings from HPC and one-time asset sales. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of robust double digit growth in continuing operations, and we continue to outperform the high end of outlook range. GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.30 well above our previously provided outlook range of $0.19 to $0.23 per share, primarily you to the same reasons for the non-GAAP outperformance and lower than expected transformation costs. Turning to margins on slides eight and nine, we continue to deliver significant margin expansion as we focus on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value higher gross margin offerings, and executing HPE Next initiatives. Gross Margin of 32.2% was up 200 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points quarter-over-quarter, the fifth quarter of sequential expansion. Expanding gross margins is very important, as it demonstrates that we have a rich portfolio of software defined offerings of significant value to our customers. Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.9% was up 70 basis points year-over-year. As mentioned, HPE Next has enabled us to redirect investments back into the business, including a double digit increase year-over-year in R&D to drive organic innovation. Now turning to the segment and business units starting on slide 10, in the Intelligent Edge revenue was down 5% year-over-year. While we saw solid growth in EMEA and APJ we underperformed in North America. We're taking action to address several improvement opportunities in our go to market execution and remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity for this business. Operating margins of 3% were down 490 basis points year-over-year due to ongoing investments in sales and R&D, as part of our announced plan to invest $4 billion into the Intelligent Edge in four years. Aruba product declined 7% due to the execution issues just highlighted in North America and longer sales cycles at some customers. Despite these challenges, we feel very good about our Intelligent Edge strategy and are launching our next generation of Wi-Fi 6 products that are just beginning to sell into the installed base and will ramp more significantly in the upcoming quarters. Aruba services, was up 18% on continued installed base growth. We will continue to push high-margin Aruba services to represent a higher portion of Aruba's total revenue. This will be a source of continued gross margin expansion for us. Moving on to slide 11, in Hybrid IT revenue was down 3% year-over-year, but up 2% excluding Tier 1 sale. Operating margins were 11.4%, up 140 basis points year-over-year at a two-year high level. Similarly to Edge we saw some execution weakness in North America and some lengthening sales cycles that slowed our growth in the quarter. Compute revenue was down 4%, but up 4% excluding Tier 1. Most importantly, our higher margin value compute business was up nearly 8% contributing 120 basis points of growth to HPE. Storage revenue was up 5% year-over-year, which marks our eighth consecutive quarter of growth. This quarter, we saw particular strength in nimble storage, which grew 45% year-over-year. We have also seen significant margin expansion as our customers embrace our intelligent storage offering. We have also made good progress installing InfoSight across three bar, which is now on approximately one third of our installed base and is shipping on all units. HPE Pointnext revenue declined 3% year-over-year, driven by our continued intentional exit from lower margin countries in the advisory and professional services business. As mentioned on earlier calls this will become less dilutive as the year progresses. Our book to bill ratio was 1.12, which is an indicator of future revenue growth. Operational services orders including nimble services orders grew 1% in constant currency, driven by growth in new attached to our higher value offerings like nimble and increasing adoption of our flexible capacity offerings with GreenLake, which had its best quarter and was up 39% year-over-year. Moving to slide 12, HPE Financial Services revenue was up 2% year-over-year in constant currency on strengthening our higher margin asset management business. Financing volume was down 6% year-over-year in constant currency, mainly driven by our business with DXC [ph]. We ended the quarter with net portfolio assets of $13 billion and loss ratios continue to be best in class at approximately 50 basis points. Operating margins increased 70 basis points year-over-year to 8.6% and return on equity was a robust 15.6%. Our financial services business continues to play a vital role, unlocking value for customers through our traditional leasing offerings, asset management services and flexible consumption offerings with GreenLake that we look to accelerate for years to come. Turning to cash flow on slide 13, free cash flow was seasonally very strong at $402 million in Q2. This is an improvement of more than $650 million versus the prior year, driven by higher profitability improved, working capital management, and lower one-time payment. Given our performance to-date, and based on our historical ramp up in the second half of the year, we feel confident that we will achieve our full-year outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash. With respect to working capital, the cash conversion cycle was a negative 21 days in Q2, as inventory became a source of cash versus being a use of cash in the same period last year. Finally, as part of our continued $7 billion capital return plan through fiscal year 2019, we returned $728 million to shareholders during the quarter. We paid $154 million in dividends and repurchased $574 million worth of shares in the quarter. As you can see from slide 14, our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with an operating company net cash balance of $1.7 billion. Also as a reminder, the vast majority of our debt is associated with the $13 billion book of net portfolio assets of our financing business. With approximately 50 basis points of bad debt as a percentage of average net receivables the underwriting performance of HPEFS is best in class, as a result, the levels of cash support for HPEFS are minimal, which enables HPEFS to generate a high return on financial assets and double digit returns on equity as mentioned before. Now turning to our outlook on slide 15, as a reminder at SAM we originally guided our non-GAAP FY 2019 EPS outlook to be $1.51 to $1 61. Due to our strong non-GAAP EPS performance in Q1, we raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.05, to $1.56 to $1.66. With our continued outperformance in Q2, we are again raising our EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect to finish fiscal year 2019 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.62 to $1.72. And we expect our fiscal year 2019 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.98 to $1.08. This is now the sixth consecutive quarter that we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook. For Q3 of fiscal year 2019, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40 to $0.44. And we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.29 to $0.33. So overall, while we have some work to do in North America sales execution, I am pleased that we continue to make progress against our strategy of shifting our portfolio towards profitable growth that will drive our free cash flow and ultimately, shareholder returns. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. First, just a couple of clarifications on EPS in the quarter, what would be the net impact of shipping fewer units into China? And then offset by the higher H3C earnings that flow through OI&E. And similarly, what was the impact of one time asset sales on EPS in the quarter? Then I have a follow up. Tarek Robbiati : Hi, Katy. When you look at overall, our business in China, you can look at page two and see the contribution it makes from a revenue standpoint. And what comes at the bottom by way of OI&E. What we explained today is that the revenue that comes from the products we sell through H3C is at preferential prices. And therefore you can assume that that revenue is relatively low gross margin. So from the top line side, the impact to the EPS is practically negligible. Within the OI&E side, you do get the benefit of the equity interest that comes from H3C from selling their products in China plus, of course, our products through their channels in China. And we received a pretty high equity interest in the quarter, but that was not the sole driver for our performance in OI&E, there were other drivers there as well, such as currency hedges, one off asset sales, and of course, the contribution of our H3C business in China. So on the whole, it's a mix of factors that have driven up OI&E. And from the top line, the contribution to EPS growth is negligible. Katy Huberty : And what was the impact of the one-time asset sales in OI&E? Tarek Robbiati : Relatively on a EPS standpoint less than $0.01. Katy Huberty : Okay, thank you. And then just as a follow up, given such strong free cash flow in the quarter, why not raise the full year and flow through that strength? I guess you knew you were going to get that question. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. It's pretty obvious. The thing we remind ourselves of where we were on a free cash flow basis when we started this fiscal year. In the first quarter we did flag that for the first time working capital would be a contributor to cash in this fiscal year as opposed to a use of cash. So in the performance on a free cash flow basis, you have the three components. Number one, the cash earnings, which are more stronger thanks to the improvement in gross margin and everything we\u2019ve done from a cash earning standpoint. Number two, the working capital, which is a very important part of the free cash flow equation. And number three, we are having less transformation costs than originally anticipated. The guidance that we provided on free cash flow is sufficiently wide $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. And we\u2019re comfortable with that level of guidance at this stage, we may want to choose during the course of the year to calibrate some investments. And that's why we're not changing the guidance. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thank you, Katy. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Please go ahead with your question. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. I just wanted to understand a bit more of what's going on in North America with Aruba? It seems like a pretty abrupt change from a business that was doing pretty well and you were highlighting significantly. So, I guess, if you can give us any more color as to, what went wrong and then the specific steps you're taking to improve the go to market? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah, thanks for the question. And good afternoon. Listen, we drove solid growth in EMEA and APJ and we continue to see the momentum going. What we uncover in North America was the market dynamic and the demand shifted in different segments of the market. And we have to make some quick adjustments on how we cover those markets where the growth is, understanding that now there is a transition on new technology with Wi-Fi 6 and other software capabilities that we just introduced to the market. But at the core of the channel was nothing more than making sure our resources and covering the market are in line what the growth is. And there was that. The second was the elongated sales cycles that we saw. And the third one was also the fact that, as people assess what's going on here in North America, particularly with global trade, we saw this elongated cycles in the decision making. And that had an impact on a few deals that shifted from Q2 to Q3. And so that come all together in a way that drove that decline in North America. But I'm really confident, A, number one, we know exactly what it is, and we have taken active action to address it. Number two, is the fact that our products and services are very differentiated. And we feel comfortable about that. But to be fair, we could have executed better in that specific segment of the business. And the good news, we know what to do. And we have put in place the changes that are needed. Shannon Cross : Okay, thank you. And then, Tarek, can you talk a bit about the gross margin improvement, more on the operational side? I'm curious as to how much you think is sustainable? How much more you think you can do? And again, some of the specific things you're doing maybe within the supply chain to take costs out? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, certainly. So expanding gross margins is very important. And I'm glad that you're focusing on it, it demonstrates that we're not a commoditizing business. And there's a lot of richness in the portfolio of software defined offerings we provide to our customers. The trends are very positive, and we expanded gross margins now for five quarters in a row, we\u2019re up to 32.2% in Q2, and this is up 200 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially, if I'm not mistaken. If you look at what has driven up the improvement, it is primarily pivoting the portfolio mix to higher revenue, rich -- margin rich revenue. That was two thirds of the improvement in gross margin. And the remaining one third came from supply chain efficiencies, the work we're doing with HPE Next, addressing manufacturing overhead and of course, lower commodity costs. So specifically, to your point, when you're asking about sustainability of that gross margin improvement, it is not prone entirely to commodity costs rising because the revenue mix is shifting to higher differentiated revenue streams that command the gross margin premium. And therefore we feel very good about the upside we have in gross margin overall as we continue to accelerate the pivot of our portfolio towards revenues that are higher gross margin. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Perfect, thanks, Shannon. Can we go to the next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I think on your last earnings call, you had talked about an expectation that revenue growth would accelerate throughout the remainder of the year, and that Aruba\u2019s growth would also accelerate throughout the year. And I hear you that things have changed. I'm just trying to maybe dimension the magnitude. So based on your Aruba statement it feels like you may be missed Aruba by $60 million. You may be missed your top line relative to that statement by $200 million or more. And so, I guess, I'm trying to understand of that other 140, how much of that was something that you think got pushed out because deals didn't close and you'll get them back next quarter? Or how much of that is the reflection of weakening demand? And given that trade really only started to rear its head like on after the quarter closed in early May, is that a potential incremental concern or headwind for Q3? So maybe you can help me dimension sort of what the magnitude of kind of the levers that you expressed were in terms of the disappointment relative to your expectations? And then, why don't some of them carry over if they are weaker demand and if we haven't really maybe seen the impact of trade hesitancy in full yet? Antonio Neri : Yes, Tony, thanks for the question. So, the market dynamics at the beginning of the quarter were certain that we felt we could accelerate. And at the end of the quarter, we saw a different story, because obviously, the uncertainty continued to be in the market. And as I said, that had an impact on elongated sales cycles, which translated in some deals shifting from Q2 to Q3, and those deals will come as we go along. Definitely, we continue to drive solid growth against our strategic initiatives. And obviously, you saw some of the numbers we quoted with Aruba services and we quoted HCI and compostable cloud and even GreenLake which had the largest quarter ever. But no question we could have executed better in some aspects of this particular on the -- as we said just a minute on the Aruba product in North America. But the reality, I cannot put a specific number associated with each of them was a combination of the market dynamics changing from the beginning of the quarter, some deals slipping to from Q2 to Q3. And then obviously, some execution aspects that we could have done better. And -- but we believe, we have the handle on the execution challenges, because that are in our control, and we know exactly which segments of the market and we have made or continue to make the changes. But the demand for ever growing amount of data, and the pipeline that we have out there continue to reflect the fact that we actually will continue to deliver on our commitment to some, which is to grow the company and obviously grow the Intelligent Edge, which is, as I said in my opening remark, is a big opportunity for the company. So, overall, I think, you know, that's how I characterize this quarter. And there are things we have in our controlling and things we have not in our control. But the pipeline, the fact that data continue to explode, and the fact that we have these deals shifting from one quarter to the other give us the understanding and the confidence that we will execute as we go along. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay, thank you for that. Just to follow-up, I was wondering if you could tell us what operational services revenue growth was in the quarter. And what the operational services order growth rate was, if we exclude nimble, because that's not part of how you define operational services as you report it. And you said last quarter that, this good book-to-bill would help growth rate in operational services. When do you expect operational services to show positive growth? Tarek Robbiati : Okay, Toni. So overall, we feel good about the long-term opportunity and profitability of Pointnext. Revenue in Q2 was down 3% year-over-year, mainly due to the continued exit of low margin countries in the advisory and professional services business. This will become less dilutive as the year progresses. Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.12 which is an indicator of future revenue growth. And in my script I've indicated that as GreenLake continues to grow there is an elongation of the cycle that we could see for recognizing the revenues pertaining to Pointnext OS. And we need several quarters off a book-to-bill ratio at current levels to be seeing Pointnext OS, operational services revenue growing. So when you look at this, what's important and what we do as we drive the book-to-bill ratio to be at or above current levels, we also drive operational services orders in nimble. And when you take the combination of operational services orders plus the nimble services orders the combination grew 1% in constant currency as we have the tailwinds of new attached offerings across our portfolio. GreenLake is really the only on-prem consumption driven offering in the market and it was up 39% year-over-year plus thing that we also announced the strategic partnership with Google cloud and Nutanix and this is to expand the GreenLake echo systems for several quarters ahead of us. So we feel good about this, it will take us a bit of time, maybe Antonio wanted to add. Antonio Neri : Yes, no just a couple of comments, Tony. So our book-to-bill ratio is what I've really measured going forward in each aspects of the portfolio because obviously when you're at these levels over time depending on the mix of what gets booked, it will drive revenue growth. And if you look at our book-to-bill ratio in Q1 was lower than Q2 even though it was above the revenue. So that means we have seen an acceleration of the book-to-bill ratio quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and as that matures becomes in the balance sheet over time you are going to see that balance sheet translated into revenue. And the other thing let's remind ourselves that GreenLake while it has potentially a longer elongated cycle because of the way the revenue gets recognized, let's remind yourself, it has 100% attach rate of operational services. Every time you sell a GreenLake it comes with hardware and 100% attach of operational services. So, as GreenLake grows, so grows our attach rate and attach rate gets recognized in the traditional way we recognize our deferred revenue for operational services. So that's why I'm very encouraged and very pleased with the performance of operational services where the book-to-bill ratio and the GreenLake because that drives 100% attach rate. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Tony. Can we get to the next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question, one question and one quick follow up, as well. First on the server side of the market, I'm just curious of how you are currently seeing component pricing, particularly DRAM pricing flow through the model, whether or not you actively reduce your pricing or if you plan to do so going forward? And kind of underneath to that, how do we think about unit growth within the server category is that -- when do we expect that to maybe trend to the positive? Antonio Neri : Thanks for the question. So the overall commodity environment continue to be favorable and there is an oversupply now compared to last year's as you recall there was shortages and costs going up. The DRAM prices are down, but let's remind our self that that does not translate in a lower AUP because at the same time we said our AUPs are two third structural because more and more options in the form of memory and flash get attached to these units. And so we have talked about this before, the fact that units get sold with more and more options even though the AUP of the components go down it does not translate in a lower AUP at the system level and that\u2019s why this quarter we again grew our compute revenue by 4% excluding Tier 1 obviously which we're intentionally declining. And despite the decline on commodity cost and that commodity cost takes time to find its way in the in the system and I always make this analogy, is when the cost goes up is like when you take off with the plane it goes up fast, when you land the plane it takes longer and this is exactly the same way. And because our unique portfolio in the compute because we have probably one of the richest portfolio in term of what I call volume and value and in value we have probably the most complete in term of mission critical, in term of in memory solutions HPC, obviously, and things like blade and compostable. We have a unique mix that bright higher value AUPs and higher attach. So it will take long time to get these numbers the lower costs in the system AUP, but at the same time, more and more options will get attached. The second part of the question was about the units. And now we are in a very low single-digit declines. And as we said before, by the end of the year, we believe this is going to be a non-event and from there on obviously, as we continue to drive this pivot to the higher value products and services, particularly in the product side we're going to see growth in that and we start to see the momentum in some of these areas like I quoted right so compostable cloud 78%, high performance compute continue to be very strong, another 25% growth. And obviously, as we close the Cray transaction that will add more to it at the larger, larger amount of scale of units, because these are big amount of systems. And then obviously, the hyper converged infrastructure as well, which are the core is a compute platform with a bunch of storage attached to it. Aaron Rakers : That's perfect. A quick follow-up, you mentioned in the call that you obviously have this put option for the H3C asset, I think at 15 times trailing 12 months net income that actually equates to a relatively large number. So I'm curious of how you think about evaluating that put option relative to the strategic nature of that relationship or how you just think about that with that now being on the table? Antonio Neri : Yes, look, it's important to realize that China is a very critical market for us. It's the largest and fastest growing IT market in the world. And we have a unique structure there with a fully operational business that makes money. And it's a structure that not many Western companies can actually claim they have. Starting May 2019, we can exercise that put option to sell part or all of our 49% stake. And if you take the minimum of the put value at 15 times trailing 12 months and earnings you get to the figures that you have in mind. But it's important to understand the contribution of H3C to the overall profit pools at UNIS, which is a listed company in China is actually generating and what is that contribution of UNIS underneath H3C on a niche unit, alongside the other entities that UNIS has. And I invite you to just take a look at this and you will form your own view as to the value of our put and what it represents for us. So, let me add a commentary on this. I mean, obviously there is a financial aspects of this and then there is the strategic aspect of this. We are incredibly pleased with this relationship and the setup in China. And it has proven to be very important and critical in the times we are living today. Because we can participate in the second largest market growing faster than any other market. And so, we are actually collecting the benefits of that growth in a unique setup that shows up in our EPS growth as we talked earlier. And obviously we have to assess a couple of things right, how that market evolves and how we participate in the market. Ultimately, what is the source of a potential use of that cash to continue to drive the growth in the company. Right now, as we said, in the opening remarks, we have no intent to sell the put option. But as always, we will continue to evaluate what is the best for the company, for our shareholders, understanding what's going on in that market and understanding how we continue to participate. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Aaron. So we're coming up on the bottom of the hour. So I think we have time for just one more question, please. Operator : And our final question today comes from Jim Suva from Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. I have one question and it's probably the CEO and CFO both want to chime in on it. But it appears that on this conference call you were a lot more vocal about the H3C operations, put options, especially to put options have been in the past. And maybe I'm just hearing that a little different. But it seems like you're a lot more vocal about that. Why is that? Is that because of the China U.S. friction? Or is that because of perhaps a lot of the guide and beat was due to this other income line? Or how should we think about, it appears to be a change in the verbalization around this line item on your income statement? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thanks for the question. I think, we felt that it was a need to provide more clarity and education on our setup. Honestly, as I go back, and listen to the type of questions and so forth, we felt we probably haven't done a good job explaining this setup and the value of this unique relationship. That's why we decided to show it to you. It has nothing to do with the U.S. China relationship. It had to do to how we drive value for shareholders. And we believe this is driving significant value for shareholders. But we didn't explain it to the extent that Tarek did today, because we felt, we didn't do a good job before. So that's why we're bringing it up. And it just happened at the same time, with everything going on in China. Now, probably people will think, well, maybe the setup is unique and it's more valuable in the context of what we see. But really, it was all about educating you in understanding this setup in the context of the valuation and the value we drive for our shareholders. And I thought Tarek did a very good job explaining that. Because it's very unique, we don't see anything out there like this. Tarek, I don't know if you want to add anything else. Tarek Robbiati : Absolutely. I will simply add that this is -- at the beginning of this month this is the first time where we can exercise the put option. And that's the reason why we talked to you about it today. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details, that make sense. I appreciate it. Antonio Neri : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Jim. I think with that we can close out the call. I know there's a heavy earning scheduled today. So appreciate everybody join us and we'll look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

My name is Gary, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We'll be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andrew Simanek : Good afternoon. I'm Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I'd like to welcome you to our fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tarek Robbiati, HPE's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast.

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our Web site and it is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call.With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In Q3, we continue to demonstrate disciplined execution, which expanded profitability across the Company. In a more uneven market, we improved both gross and operating margins, delivered strong non-GAAP earnings per share and generated a record level of year-to-date free cash flow. These results reflect our momentum as we take deliberate steps to shift our portfolio to higher-value, software-defined offering delivered as a service.This quarter, we also advanced our innovation agenda. We made organic investments in new products and announced strategic acquisitions that drive growth by significantly enhancing our ability to help customers with their digital transformations. We delivered revenues of $7.2 billion in Q3, up 1% sequentially, and down 3% year-over-year adjusted for the Tier 1 business. Our revenue growth was primarily impacted by delivery actions through HP Next, including portfolio rationalization, as well as some microeconomic factors.Importantly, we continue to deliver growth in key areas of strategic investment, including high-performance compute, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, Hybrid Cloud, HPE Pointnext services orders, of which GreenLake is a key driver of our growth. Our gross margin of 33.9% is up 170 basis points from last quarter and 340 basis points year-over-year. This was fueled by the mix shift to higher value offerings and commodities pricing tailwinds.Non-GAAP operating profit margin of 9.9% is up 80 basis points year-over-year. And our non-GAAP EPS of $0.45 is up 7% year-over-year and above the high end of our previous outlook. But the quantity and the quality of our free cash flow continues to improve. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $860 million, which is up $790 million from the same prior year period. As a result of our ongoing performance, I am very pleased to say that this marks our seventh quarter of raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the year.Before I provide specific highlights of our business performance, I will offer a few perspectives on the macro environment. We continue to see uneven demand due in part to ongoing trade tensions, which impact market stability and customer confidence. This is showing up in elongated sales cycles, particularly in larger deals as we noted last quarter and reiterated during our IR Summit at our Discover conference in June.However, our customers continue to affirm their need to accelerate their digital transformations to improve business outcomes and customer and employee experiences while reducing cost.The exposure of data will continue to fuel underlying demand for solutions to help, protect, store, manage and analyze their vigor. And this is where we are laser focused. We have a strong portfolio of solutions and services that span the Intelligent Edge and hybrid cloud. We are uniquely in position to help our customers with this transition. This is why at our Discover conference, we unveiled new innovations to accelerate customers' enterprises with eccentric cloud enabled and data driven solutions. And I announced that we will offer our entire HP portfolio as a service by 2022.To share pro forma highlights from our business segments, I will start with Intelligent Edge. In Q3, our Intelligent Edge business delivered revenue of $762 million, up 14% sequentially, which is better than our sequential growth last year but down 2% year-over-year. As we noted last quarter, we are actively addressing the sales coverage model in United States. I am pleased with the actions taken to-date that have resulted in positive attraction with our U.S. product business, which was up over 40% sequentially.We delivered solid growth in EMEA and APJ and in our Aruba services business. This growth was driven in part by new customer wins. For instance, Vancouver Clinic, which provides healthcare services across Southern Washington, wanted to deliver modern healthcare and reliable connectivity for staff, nurses and doctors to access patient records and utilize medical devices. They chose Aruba's mobile first network with ArubaOS 8 to deliver secure mobility and allow the clinic to perform live network upgrades without interrupting connectivity.A key factor in their decision was Aruba ClearPass, which addressed their security concerns as it allows the IT team to quickly and easily create policies for authenticating and on-boarding new devices. With a population of more than 750,000 residents, the County of San Mateo here in California has standardized on Aruba for their wireless network access control and edge switching solutions. A key factor in the county's decision to choose Aruba was its need for secure and stable access to mission critical applications in locations such as the county funded hospitals.Customers are recognizing the advantage of Aruba solutions to deliver exceptional customer experiences of the Intelligent Edge. This is one reason Aruba emerged as the only vendor in the leaders' category in the recent Forrester New Wave Wireless Solution report, which evaluated eight of the most significant vendors in the wireless space. We also launched new offerings during the quarter, including solutions for a fast growing mid-and small-market customer segments and extended services to capture additional enterprise customers.We introduced Aruba Instant On, a secure, scalable and simple Wi-Fi solution for small businesses, allowing the SMB market to benefit from a proven enterprise expertise. Now small businesses can deliver a seamless wireless experience with an easy setup that can be managed from any mobile device. We extended the HPE GreenLake portfolio to the Edge by announcing HPE GreenLake for Aruba, which gives organization flexibility and choice in how they obtain and support their Edge infrastructure.We unveiled exciting enhancements to Aruba Central, our cloud based network platform that manages more than 20,000 customers' branch networks. With this next generation, customer will benefit from artificial intelligence powered network analytics, improved security and user centric assurance for wired, wireless and Edge infrastructures from a single point of control. We believe the Intelligent Edge is the natural next step of the cloud experience. The opportunity at the edge is all about using technology and data to bridge the digital and physical worlds. Increasingly, business outcomes will depend on the experiences that enterprises can deliver at the Edge. Our strong portfolio enables us to capitalize on this exciting opportunity.Turning to Hybrid IT, we delivered our highest operating margins since Q1 fiscal year '17. Our operating margin of 12.7% was up 260 basis points year-over-year. Revenue of $5.5 billion was down 3% year-over-year when adjusted for Tier 1 in China. While we saw some signs of microeconomic softness and longer sales cycles in certain markets, we realize the year-over-year traction in critical areas for customers. High performance compute realized its 10th consecutive quarter of growth and compostable cloud grew 28%. While storage overall experienced a modest revenue decline against the tougher market backdrop in year-over-year compare, we gained momentum in key strategic areas like HP Nimble Storage, which grew 21% and Hyperconverged which grew 4%.On the innovation front, we announced HPE Primera, a new storage platform for mission critical workloads. HPE Primera offers unprecedented deployment times of 20 minutes, a guarantee of 100% data availability and upgrades with no downtime for a truly differentiated customer experience. HP Pointnext services orders included Nimble orders grew 2% in constant currency, as we have the highest quarter yet for services intensity. We demonstrated success in attaching a greater level of services and favorable mix shift to infrastructure with higher attach rates. HPE GreenLake is now one of our fastest growing businesses.This quarter, we continued to see very strong customer momentum with order growth of 10% year-over-year, or 42% excluding one large deal from the prior year. In addition to bringing as a service to the Edge with HPE GreenLake for Aruba this quarter, we also launched new solution to accelerate HPE GreenLake growth in the mid-market. Customers are choosing HPE GreenLake for choice, flexibility and speed to market. For instance, we were selected by the Publicis Groupe for our HPE GreenLake for SAP HANA, a managed private cloud solution to provide speed, scalability and budget predictability.As part of their most to SAP HANA, Publicis evaluated public cloud alternatives but determined that on-premises model with our pay per use managed solution built on HPE's recognized industry leadership was the right option for them. Additional customer wins during the quarter demonstrate the strength of our portfolio. We won a significant deal with Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG. The Company was looking for a cloud like pay-per-use model with an intelligent data platform that could offer high-speed and low latency. And HPE was the only company with a model that could meet both needs through HPE GreenLake and HPE 3PAR.In addition, Chase Center the new home of the NBA Golden State Warriors chose HPE SimpliVity for its 18,000 capacity arena, enabling our private cloud to run application at scale. Chase Center will open its store next month ahead of the 2019-2020 NBA Season, and is already working with Aruba to power personalized digital connected experiences for fans and guests. In Q3, we also expanded our innovation through our important partnerships and strategic acquisitions. We deepened our strategic relationship with Google Cloud to deliver true hybrid cloud for containers with a choice for as a service delivery through HP GreenLake. We first announced the relationship in April with two HPE validated designs for Google Cloud Anthos. This expansion shows the growing understanding and acceptance of the fact that the world is hybrid.Just yesterday, we announced the expansion of our partnership with VMware to offer VMware Cloud Foundation as a service. Through the integration of HPE GreenLake and HPE Synergy with VMware Cloud Foundation, our two companies will allow mutual customers to keep all their applications, tools and data in place, while achieving the benefits of cloud and compostable infrastructure. On the acquisition front just after our Q3 close, we acquired MapR's business assets. We have been building our HPE AI portfolio over the last few years. With MapR's enterprise grade file system and cloud native storage, we have a complete portfolio of products to drive AI and analytics applications.The technology is also highly complementary to BlueData's container platform strategy. HPE plans to support existing customer deployments along with ongoing renewals, and we are pleased to welcome MapR customers and partners and the MapR team to the HPE family. As you would remember, we announced the Cray acquisition early in Q3 and now expect to close the Cray transaction by the end of Q4 fiscal year 2019 earlier than originally planned. HPC continues to be a strategic focus area for HPE, and we have a clear differentiation that is even further strengthened by Cray. For instance, Cray recently announced its Second Exascale Supercomputer Award with Lawrence Livermore National Lab. And last week, HPE jointed NASA Ames at the grand opening of its Modular Supercomputing Facility in Mountain View, California. Supporting our purpose to advance the way we live and work, HPE is building a new supercomputer based on the HPE SGI 8600 system as researchers work to land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024.Turning to HPE Financial Services, revenue of $818 million represented a modest year-over-year decline. However, financing volume was up 5% when adjusted for currency and operating profit increased 90 basis points year-over-year. HPEFS remains a strategic business that continues to help customers manage and monetize their existing assets in new ways, as well as address the entire product lifecycle to reduce the cost resource demands of IT.In summary, I am pleased with our disciplined and focused execution which delivered strong operational performance this quarter. We have been able to simultaneously invest in the future growth of our business, while expanding operating margins, delivering non-GAAP EPS above our previous outlook and generating record levels of cash flow. I remain very confident in our strategy and our ability to continue to drive profitable growth as we pursue the exciting plans we unveiled at Discover to offer our entire portfolio as a service by 2022. By doing so, we will be well positioned to deliver long-term recurring revenue growth and profit.It is an exciting time at HPE. Over the last two years, we have shifted our portfolio and aligned our investments and execution to that shift. The hard work has paved the way for us to innovate and we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant opportunity in front of us and to continue to deliver strong shareholder value. We look forward to providing more details about our long terms plans at our Security Analyst Meeting in New York on October 23rd.With that, I will turn it over to Tarek. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. Now, let me provide more detail on our financial results for the quarter. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight our performance in the third quarter of our fiscal year.Starting with Slides 1 and 2, I would like to talk about the key highlights from this quarter. The main takeaways are that we have significantly expanded gross margin this quarter, while simultaneously making further investments in the business and delivering non-GAAP EPS above our previous outlook that we will raise for the full year, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of increased non-GAAP EPS guidance. We have also reached record levels of free cash flow compared to the prior year-to-date period, and grew revenue sequentially in an uneven macro environment.While our revenue continues to be in transition due to deliberate actions such as Tier 1 sales, China optimization and A&PS country exits, we're pivoting our portfolio towards with higher margin and more recurring revenues. This has translated into gross margin expanding by 340 basis points year-over-year this quarter, driven by our portfolio mix shift and commodity tailwinds. Our ongoing execution discipline demonstrates that our underlying profitability and quality of earnings continue to improve quarter-after-quarter. I'll talk more about this in the upcoming slides.On the cash front, we delivered the highest level of free cash flow we have achieved through the third quarter of the fiscal year as Hewlett Packard Enterprise. With respect to GAAP EPS, we finished the quarter with an EPS loss of $0.02 that included $0.42 reserve due to a one-time arbitration award to DXC compared to the previously provided outlook of $0.29 to $0.33 per share for the quarter. While we are disappointed with the ruling, it is important to note that at this stage, our fiscal year '19 free cash flow guidance remains unchanged.Finally, we also announced recent strategic investment in Cray and MapR. We already closed the purchase of MapR's business assets that we acquired for less than one-time annual revenue. We are also making good progress towards closing the Cray transaction, which is now expected to close by the end of quarter four of fiscal year '19 earlier than originally anticipated. We look forward to driving significant value from both these acquisitions next year.Moving onto to a macro view of the business on Slide 3. We continue to see an uneven demand environment, largely caused by trade tensions similar to what we called out last quarter's earnings and reiterated at our Discover event in June. While elongated sales cycles persist and remain more pronounced for larger enterprise deals, they are not materially worse than in June. HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets. We have also been able to successfully navigate all of the recent tariff increases on China exports that have been factored into our outlook.We will now move to Slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge, we began to make progress improving our go-to-market execution in the United States where our product revenue grew over 40% sequentially. We have also introduced several new offerings for the mid market and SMB market that are gaining traction. Aruba services growth continues to be solid across all geographies.In hybrid IT, we continued to grow our higher margin offerings with Composable Cloud growing at 28% and high performance compute at 2%. Within storage, we again saw notable strength in Nimble Storage, which grew 21% and Hyperconverged Infrastructure, which grew 4%. In our services business, Pointnext operational services orders and Nimble services orders together were up 3% in constant currency, driven by GreenLake orders, which grew 10 % year-over-year. Pointnext advisory and professional services orders also grew in constant currency. And within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 5% year-over-year in constant currency and return on equity remains strong, exceeding 15% again this quarter.Now we will turn to Slide 5 that demonstrates the many contributions we derived from our unique partnership with H3C. As you know, H3C is a major player in the fast growing China market with number one market share in campus switching and wireless LAN. As noted on the slide, profit contribution from H3C occurs in three areas; HPE's sales of products to H3C for resale in China market; HPE's resale of H3C's products in the rest of the world outside China; and HPE's share or H3C's profits based upon HPE's 49% stake in H3C. We greatly value our unique partnership with H3C, which helps us capitalize on the incredible growth opportunity in the world's second largest IT market. In addition, HPE's 49% equity stake and H3C has been increasing in value through the put option and publicly traded market value of units.Slide 6 shows are EPS performance to-date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.45 in Q3 is well above our previously provided outlook of $0.40 to $0.44 due to operational outperformance. This marks the ninth quarter in a row that we have exceeded the high end of our non-GAAP quarterly outlook. On a year-to-date basis, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share has grown 21%. As a reminder, we ended fiscal year '17 with a non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.94. Based on our updated fiscal year '19 non-GAAP EPS outlook of $1.74 at the midpoint, we have demonstrated tremendous progress in non-GAAP EPS, which has grown by over 85% in the last two years. We have been able to achieve this through significant expansion of our gross and operating margins, which I will talk about next.Turning to gross margins on Slide 7. We continued to deliver significant gross margin expansion as we focus on profitable growth in hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher value, higher gross margin offerings and commodity tailwinds. Gross margins of 33.9% was up 340 basis points year-over-year and up 170 basis points quarter-over-quarter, the sixth quarter of sequential expansion.Since Q1 fiscal year 2018, we have expanded gross margin by 560 basis points through a combination of portfolio mix shift, HPE Next initiative and commodity tailwinds. Expanding gross margins is very important as it demonstrates that we have a broad portfolio of software defined, IP rich offerings of significant value to our customers. Similar to the last quarter, let me show you on Slide 8 how the mix shift in our portfolio is improving our underlying profitability and quality of earnings. Year-to-date, we have expanded gross margins by 270 basis points, driven by portfolio mix shift combined with supply chain efficiencies and lower commodities cost.Now let me put in perspective the key metrics to measure our mix shift as we pivot our portfolio. The left hand side of the chart shows how the various businesses within hybrid IT contributed to HPE's overall revenue growth in the first three quarters of this fiscal year along with a spectrum of gross margins. First, currency has been a headwind this year of about 130 basis points year-to-date. Second, we continued to wind down the low margin areas of our Tier 1 business that was roughly 5% of our total revenue last year versus only about 2% this year, but at much better gross margins. In compute, the volume compute business declined slightly diluting growth by 70 basis points. But more importantly, our higher-margin value compute business grew 4% year-to-date and contributed 90 basis points to overall growth at much higher margin.Storage contributed another 20 basis points to overall growth year-to-date, driven by 49% growth in Nimble. In services, we grew operational services orders, including Nimble services at 2% year to date, driven by GreenLake subscription services, which was up 24%. These are both important lead indicators to overall future point next revenue growth. The key takeaway is that our portfolio mix shift is working and our underlying profitability and overall quality of earnings is materially improved.Now moving to Slide 9. We have been able to make significant investments in R&D and sales to support future revenue growth, while driving significant non-GAAP operating margin expansion. HPE Next has enabled us to redirect investments back into the business, including a double digit increase year-to-date in R&D to drive organic innovation in our higher margin, faster growth areas of the portfolio and additional investments in go to market to improve sales effectiveness. We expect to drive revenue productivity and growth in the upcoming quarters from these strategic investments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating margin has find back up to nearly 10%, up over 250 basis points versus six quarters ago.Turning to cash flow on Slide 10. Free cash flow was seasonally very strong at $648 million in Q3. On a year-to-date basis, we have delivered a record level of $860 million in free cash flow that is up $790 million versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher profitability and lower one-time payments. Underpinning our year-to-date free cash flow performance is an over $900 million improvement in our cash flow from operations relative to last year. Consequently, at this stage, we believe that we can absorb the unexpected DXC award payment of $666 million to be made in Q4 within our existing full year outlook of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion of free cash flow.Slide 11 shows our capital returns to-date. As part of our continued $7 billion capital return plans through fiscal year '19, we returned $727 million to shareholders during the quarter. We paid $150 million in dividends and repurchased $577 million worth of shares in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned approximately $2.4 billion to shareholders with $500 million in dividend and $1.9 billion in share repurchases.Now turning to our outlook on Slide 12. As a reminder, at SAM, we originally guided our fiscal year '19 non-GAAP EPS outlook to be $1.51 to $1.61. Due to our strong non-GAAP EPS performance, we raised our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 in Q1, and other $0.06 in Q2 to $1.62 to $1.72. With continued operational outperformance in Q3, we are again raising our EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect to finish fiscal year '19 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of a $1.72 to a $1.76, and we expect our fiscal year '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69. This is now the seventh consecutive quarter that we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook.So overall, I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make on our revenue and margin transition. We will continue to execute against our strategy of shifting our portfolio towards profitable growth that will drive our free cash flow and ultimately shareholder returns. And as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Securities Analyst Meeting on October 23rd in New York where we will provide an update on our strategy and financial outlook.Now with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Yes, thank you, good afternoon. We\u2019ve heard from some of your peers over the last couple of weeks that lower commodity costs are starting to be pass-through to customers in the form of lower ASPs. Can you just talk through how that will influence margins over the next couple of quarters? Can you hold on to the margin benefit from commodity prices, or will some of that come out of the model? And then I have a follow-up. Antonio Neri : Yes, thanks, Katy for the question. Definitely, the commodity prices has started to come down. But I think we have executed with discipline on pricing and costs. And therefore, we're able to hold a lot of that. And in the short-term, we believe that will be the case, think about one to two quarters. But at the same time, let's remind ourselves that the content, since you asked the question about ASPs. The content that gets attached to each of the solutions continue to grow. So whether it is memory, sizing or storage sizing continues to grow. While the cost per bit maybe coming down, the reality more our overall content gets attached, and therefore less impact on AUPs. But I think we have done an excellent job in retaining the cost decline through more content attach and better pricing discipline. Tarek has a comment on that. Tarek Robbiati : I just want to add to what Antonio said. There are two effects had played, as you pointed out; one is a tailwind from commodities that Antonio commented on; and there is also the revenue mix shift. The revenue mix shift is really critical to us sustaining the gross margins going forward. And we're confident that by continuing to grow the areas, the revenue streams of higher gross margin, we can maintain the level of gross margins we have overall. Katy Huberty : And then just as a follow-up on cash flow, you're holding the full year guidance despite the over $600 million payment. Can you just talk about what the offsetting positives are to help you hold free cash flow guidance? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, I'm glad you asked the question. Last time even I spoke and you asked us why we didn't raise the free cash flow guidance, you may remember that. My answer to your prior question was we had a pretty wide range of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. So we stopped to that guidance back then. And now specifically with DXC award from the arbitration, we feel that there are essentially three factors that give us confidence to be able to still deliver the guidance at $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.Number one, you know that our Q4 quarter is the strongest one from a free cash flow generation. We continue to believe this will be the case in this quarter; number two, if you really look at the free cash flow guidance of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and the outperformance on non-GAAP EPS that our performance is about $250 million in underlying cash flow earnings; and number three, we also said at the beginning of the fiscal year that our working capital will be this year contributor to free cash flow as opposed to a use of cash flow resources. So the combination of these three factors makes us believe that at this time, we can withstand the payment of $666 million to DXC. I will not hide from you that this won't be easy. But at this stage, we feel comfortable we can do that. Operator : Next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : I wanted to dig a bit more into the gross margin. I understand Next is a big part and obviously components. But you know, I think Tarek, you said it would be sustainable at these levels. And I'm kind of curious as to how far you think you can take some of the improvements that you're doing right now? And how much further there is to go with gross margin? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : So as Antonio said, we feel that the commodity tailwinds will continue for a little bit, couple of quarters as he mentioned in the prior question. Over and above that the revenue mix shift plays a very important role in driving higher gross margins. The revenue streams that we have highlighted on our presentation on Slide 7, if numbering is correct -- Slide 8, excuse me. If you really stack up these revenue streams, they all come up with improved gross margins individually due to the commodities, but also as the more higher value revenue streams from value, compute and storage kick-in, you can see that the revenue mix will move into favorable gross margin territory.And third, I think you know we are also as a management team looking always at ways under HPE Next and otherwise through our global operations team, finding efficiencies in the way we repurchase commodities to build our product that we manufacture. So on the whole we feel that we have sufficient levers between commodity tailwinds, supply chain efficiencies and revenue mix to sustain the gross margin. Antonio Neri : And I will add then on, which you've kind of -- Tarek, provided a comprehensive answer is the fact there is always opportunity to improve our cost structure. HPE Next was the framework to go about it, and we made huge progress. But since then we have cover all the areas, which we are executing and that's the normal course of business management. Shannon Cross : And then I understand net of Tier 1, you were down about 30% in revenue and there is puts and takes throughout the model. How do you think about revenue as a -- revenue growth versus profitability? I don't know, Antonio, if you want to sort of just balance them off, because clearly at some point we would help you shift back more into a revenue growth situation. So that will take acquisition and continue mix shift. So, I\u2019m just curious how you sort of think about that versus cash flow and margin? Thank you. Antonio Neri : I mean listen finding the right balance between growth and profit is always what we are after. I think as Tarek said, the portfolio mix shift is something that we are completely committed to do and is paying off, which has allowed us to make investments in the business in the areas we see the growth is going to happen going forward. And in that investment is both organic and inorganic, so we made a commitment to particular segments of the market on Intelligent Edge, which I believe is the next frontier through connectivity, security and the cloud consumption model.I think the multiple use cases we see expanding in that space are sources of growth, and we feel pretty good about with the latest innovation we brought into the market. As I think about the core business right, the workload optimize cloud enabled and consumption driven model are areas of growth. And in that, when you think about workloads we will drive growth, we talk about HPC, high-performance compute, the ability to provide hybrid solutions with software defined experiences is where we're making investments.And so for us, finding that balance is key but also getting the portfolio in the right place is what we are really after. And obviously, we believe we are in the right place. And the service piece of this is obviously very critical. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m so excited about the GreenLake offering, because there is a point of differentiation for us in the marketplace that customers are paying attention and even our competitors for that matter. But getting growth also on the underlying businesses like we did with Nimble is as foundational. I don't know Tarek if you want to add anything. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, I just would like to put a little bit more context on what Antonio has said and put some perspective on our fiscal year '19. Fiscal year '19 was not a year where we wanted to dial up the growth. Fiscal year '19 is a year where we had to deliver on EPS commitment, drive free cash flow, these are the two most important metrics, prepare ourselves to dial-up the growth in the subsequent quarters. And we feel that we've done a fair bit of progress here. There\u2019s of course more to be done. But you can see on Slide 9 that we\u2019ve made significant investments in FSC dollars and R&D dollars to dial-up the growth in the upcoming quarters.In addition to Antonio\u2019s point, the inorganic investments that we have made will bear fruit. Effectively today, we secured the approval for the completion of the Cray acquisition. This has become official just a few minutes before our call. So we will close the Cray acquisition in Q4 of fiscal year '19 and start to consolidate immediately upon the close, which is late in the quarter of fiscal year '19. More of that growth will be felt in fiscal year '20 as a result of the consolidation but notwithstanding the consolidation of Cray, we will grow our business overall. Operator : And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : I'd just like to revisit the gross margin topic one more time. Maybe you can help provide what estimate you think was -- what percentage of the gross margin improvement year-over-year and sequentially was driven by commodities? And whether you can confirm there were no one-time factors in Q3? I was just struck by how much gross margins went up sequentially when revenues were essentially flat, Tier 1 was essentially flat and there didn't seem to be really radical mixes in your business on a sequential basis, yet margins went up a 170 basis points. So maybe you can help clarify how much was attributable to commodities year-over-year and sequentially that there were no other one-time factors? And how we should think about sequential dynamics? Antonio Neri : So there are no one-time factors that affect the gross margins that's the first thing you can take that off the table. The second thing Toni that affects the gross margins is, the mix shifts versus the commodities. I'd say to put some metrics around this, roughly 50% was mix shift and 50% was commodities. As part of that, you also have to the mix shift pertaining to Pointnext. Pointnext OS cost of services is effectively affecting our gross margin. We're injecting more and more automation in Pointnext OS to reduce the actual cost of labor that affects the gross margin component.So all of the levers that are available to us and I -- last but not least the supply chain as we spoke a moment ago, are contributing to augmenting the gross margins. We have a new team in global operations. We are starting to feel the weight of -- that they carry and the traction they're gaining. We want to see further savings from supply chain moving forward. And so on the whole, because we know this is the most important metric that govern the tax base, we will drive the gross margins to higher level. So how high is up? It's for us to see and for you to determine overtime as we execute. But we are very pleased with the progress so far, Toni. Tarek Robbiati : And Toni, I will add one thing. Obviously, we talk about our newness and what\u2019s going on in the market. But I think this team has executed with discipline. Discipline to participate in the market we want to compete, to extract value from that market. And that's what resulted in expanded profitability. Toni Sacconaghi : If I could just follow-up, you've talked about unevenness in macro. I guess the question is. How do you know that sort of what you're seeing or the revenue softness that you're experiencing is not due to a more structural shift to the cloud, or some of these customers that are pausing or not thinking about tighter partnerships with cloud vendors? And what makes you confident I guess that the revenue weakness that you've seen, I think relative to expectations, because I think at the beginning of the year you're optimistic that growth would accelerate through the year. So relative to those initial expectations, what makes you confident that this is not something structural rather than what appears to be cyclical demand factors that you're citing? Antonio Neri : Yes, Tony, I mean, let me start by stating that the world is hybrid. And I quote that some of the deals that we won this quarter, where you see the value of placing data and workloads both on-prem and off-prem and that's the new reality. And more and more of those overloads and data will be processed at the edge and that's the big opportunity. That's why I have a lot of confidence and confidence in the fact that the data around us will continue to explode, fueled by the digital transformation we all experience in every industry. That data has tremendous value.We are only utilizing 6% of that data today and that's why we see an acceleration of new techniques, like AI, machine learning, big data analytics. And that's why we're making quite a significant of investments first to make our infrastructure more intelligent so that our customers don't need to spend money running that infrastructure. Second, to give a simple experience, like you would think about the public cloud in many ways but with the same economics, because we have talked to -- I spend 50% of my time with customers and they are telling me at their scale of production workloads, it is cheaper for them to run it on-prem than off-prem. That said, they will put workloads in both places. And last but not least is the fact that they want to consume more and more as a service, and that's the new reality.And so that's why when I bring it together, the world is hybrid, the Edge is becoming more and more intelligence, the data has value, because that's where outcomes have been derived. And I think our portfolio is uniquely positioned to address these new realities and how we connect this world is opportunity going forward. We have been trimming down, pruning down all the areas we don't want to participate and unfortunately that has taken time for as the Tier 1 business or some of the advice and professional services and companies where we believe we couldn't get scale, re-pivot that resources and funding as we want to go forward and then augment that investment with targeted, very disciplined acquisition or return on invested capital that will drive growth.And that's why I'm confident, Toni. Obviously, we need the right innovation and the right talent. But I will say this team is really executing with remarkable discipline and you can see the expanded profitability, and I think that will continue. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Paul Coster : Just drilling into the uneven demand comment, I wonder, if you've noticed or any difference in the behavior of enterprise customers versus SMB's? Or whether there's any verticals, which are standing up quite well under this sort of onslaught of news? And if there are any verticals which on the other hand looking particularly uncertain about their IT spending? Tarek Robbiati : So I will say the SMB market continues to be strong and this where we are putting a lot of our emphasis on what we call in a no touch low touch model for the transactional high velocity business. We also introduced new offerings targeted for that segment of the market. An example is Aruba Instant On where you know now you can, if you are a small business from a single couple of clicks back two, three clicks on a mobile app, you can actually deploy entire Wi-Fi infrastructure for less than $200. And so that [Technical Difficulty]\u2026 Operator : Pardon me, this is a conference operator. It appears we have had a disconnection from the speakers' location. Please standby as we try to reconnect them. Pardon me, this is the conference operator. I have rejoined the speaker location to the call. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to turn the call back over to speaker location. Andrew Simanek : This is Andy. Sorry everyone for the technical difficulties we were having there. So, we'll jump back in with -- I believe Paul Coster asked a question about the macro environment, and any particular verticals that we're seeing unchanged. So Antonio\u2026 Antonio Neri : Yes sorry about that, I'm not sure what happened. We will check into after this. But you asked the question about the unevenness of the market and most importantly which segment of the market. I will start to answer the question that, we see good momentum in SMB and mid-market, particularly in the transactional business. And that\u2019s why we have a lot of focus both on the product portfolio and the go-to-market. We\u2019ll make some announcement with Aruba on Instant On and the low touch no touch, particularly on the e-commerce side with our channel partners.And then on enterprise, we see strong demand in healthcare. I spend a lot of time with them here at our ADC because of the digitization of the experiences, with the mobile first cloud first approach, at same time the industrial space with manufacturing. They need to bridge the analog world with the digital world. Oil and gas obviously continue to be a little bit hit and miss there, because of the situation with oil. But overall, I mean, when it comes down to larger deals that\u2019s where we see the elongated sales cycles. Sorry about the disruption. Operator : And the next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : I first wanted hopefully simple, maybe clarification. Appreciate you're reiterating the fiscal '19 free cash flow target. In June, you had also reiterated the fiscal '20 target for roughly $2 billion of free cash flow. Just wanted to make sure that nothing has changed in your view on that fiscal '20 target? Tarek Robbiati : Thank you for asking the question. I should have mentioned this. Nothing has changed for our 2020 $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion of free cash flow guidance. Simon Leopold : And then, I wanted to get back to the trending. One of the things we heard about and I think you'd even addressed is, declining ASPs. And clearly, your costs have come down faster and you've benefitted from mix. Is there some element that you could help us quantify the dynamic of what degree you're reducing price since that will factor into maybe our revenue estimates? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : So we are starting to see AUP come down, which were up at very low single-digits and these were reflecting lower DRAM cost that are starting to be pass through. But we're now almost at a full Gen10 mix. So we're getting less uplift from the new generation. Having said that, we continue to see more and more option attach and richer configurations, as Antonio mentioned, that will continue to be a trend due to the ever increasing amount of data that has been generated and consumed. So consequently, we should see AUPs tick back up overtime DRAM costs start to level off or even potentially rebound in the future. Antonio Neri : And I want to add to that, that since, I run the compute business for several years. And I have to tell you, the tick-tock of the technologies and the amount of memory storage you can attach continue to increase. As we go through the next generation or Gen11 and just take a look at just the latest announcements we made with the AMD, the amount of memory channels you can attach more options to it continues to grow. And so now on the same form factor, you have way more memory and way more storage capacity.And like I said before, as the cost per bit may be going down the number of bits continue to grow. And therefore, what we said before is two-third of that AUP is structural and that will continue, because now we have new solutions like non-volatile memory and so forth. And so, those are technologies that will find its way through the portfolio that we already provide in the next generations. Operator : And the next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the execution on the mix of the business driving forward. On the mix discussion, I'm curious, it looks like now your Tier 1 customers for this given quarter has fallen below 1% of total revenue. So it looks like that's kind of that mix shift has finalized itself. But I'm curious in terms of the overall mix of compute between value versus the volume. Where does that mix stand today? And how do you think about that mix, or what it could look like over the next year or two years? And I have a follow-up. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, look you're right in your assertion around Tier 1. Right now, Tier 1 as we said is 2.2% of HPE's revenue year-to-date. So in the last quarter, it was roughly the amount as you've indicated. But it is coming at a much higher gross margin and we're happy with that level of gross margin. Revenue with no gross margin makes no sense to us. With respect to the rest, 50-50 is roughly the answer between volume compute and value compute. But within that, you also have more and more software defined solution, which will lift the gross margin up of each of those two categories. And so that is important to note. We're making those investments in R&D to drive differentiation. That differentiation comes in the form of software defined infrastructure, in both volume and value compute and of course, needless to say, storage and all the other offerings that we have in hybrid it. Aaron Rakers : And then as a follow-up going back to GreenLake. I think the last quarter or last couple of quarters, you've given some metrics. I know that orders look like they were up about 10%. But I'm curious any update on how many customers have adopted versus the 600 that was quoted last quarter? And where do we stand as far as the contract value of GreenLake at this point? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : So we have north of 600 customers right now. Our total contract value is in excess of $2.5 billion from GreenLake. Antonio Neri : And as we go along, we're going to share more about this. But the bottom line there is with new logos and expansion of current contracts, so that's the reality. And one of the things that we saw with GreenLake, which is very pleasing is the ability to continue to grow once you're in the contract. And the renewal rates, which are 99% and the NPS score is 91, which is remarkable for a business like that. And one comment I want to add on the volume versus value. We categorize that based on the type of server we talked before on the compute side, but more of the volume will become value as we add, to Tarek point, more software and more of the IP we acquire, particularly in areas like Plexxi in a compostable rack. And you can think about a server that has a volume aspect but a ton of value added on top therefore becomes, in a packaged solution, becomes a value overtime. Andrew Simanek : So we're already running over time. But I wanted to make sure we gave a little extra since we went dark for a second. So, let's go ahead and take one last question, please. Operator : And that question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : I wanted to ask about the Pointnext trends and op services within that. So Pointnext still deteriorating by 4%, but op services up 3%. I just wonder if you guys can help us understand when you would expect that overall line maybe to stabilize. And we'd love it if you'd give you of course the proportionate split between the two things? And then I have a follow-up. Tarek Robbiati : So remember, in Pointnext overall, you have two revenue streams that have very different economics. One is Pointnext OS and the other one is the A&PS business. Overall, we feel good about the long-term opportunity in Pointnext and particularly following Antonio's announcement at Discover to offer our entire portfolio as a service by 2022, and this is where the GreenLake plays a crucial role. In Q3, the services orders for Pointnext OS and Nimble grew 3% in constant currency, and our book-to-bill ratio was similar to last quarter about 1.12.It is important to understand that the mix shift that we're driving across the portfolio of compute to more sophisticated software defined offerings is increasing our attach rates and service intensity to levels that we haven't witnessed in the past. The service intensity in Q3 was the highest quarter ever. GreenLake as we mentioned is also a key driver of Pointnext orders, and is one of our fastest growing businesses with strong customer momentum, and GreenLake grew 42%. So that gives you good color around Pointnext OS. And with respect to A&PS, it's a much smaller portion of the total Pointnext revenue stream. And we are optimizing that business for growth and profitability with the country exits that Antonio referred to at the beginning of this conversation. Rod Hall : And then just a quick follow-up, since we're over time. Could you just clarify, I heard your comments on AUP starting to decline a little bit in core compute ex-Tier 1. Could you just clarify what is happening there with unit volume trends? Tarek Robbiati : So units were still declining at the low single-digit rate. This hasn't changed but it doesn't truly bothers me again, it's just as this -- what we're trying to do is to shift towards those units that drive higher services attached, number one. There is also, an important point to note is that when you look at units on a sequential basis, they were up. So what matters is that we look at the momentum of the business overall and what drives the attach rates, which is service intensity in the right type of units, we feel reasonably good about the performance on this quarter on that front. Antonio Neri : But I think this is something very important, our units were up sequentially, and after that the major takeaway. And second is that, our ability to attach to the right units has improved dramatically and that's why we draw the best services intensity yet. And so for us that's what our strategy is and more software content we add, obviously we attach all the type of services, particularly in the software license associated with those units, not just associated Proactive Care or break/fix type of support.Again apologies, I don't know what happened to the web service here, but we're looking to it. But I just want to wrap up by reiterating that we are pleased with our progress in what we call an uneven market. We executed with strong discipline, which obviously you can see the results and expanded profitability on record levels of cash flow that give us the confidence to raise our outlook and reaffirm both to 2019 and 2020 free cash flow. And at the same time, we continue to invest in the business, both organic and inorganically so we can continue to focus on that growth that Shannon asked the question with the right level of profit.So with that, we're looking forward to see you on October 23rd, at the Security Analyst meeting. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

My name is Sean, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call Mr. Andrew Simanek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Andrew Simanek : Good afternoon. I am Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I'd like to welcome you to our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tarek Robbiati, HPE's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Before handing the call over to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast.

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and it is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call.With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We have just closed a very successful fiscal year 2019 at HPE marked by strong and consistent performance across the company. We did what we said we would do this year and built on our track record of delivering on our promise since I became CEO almost two years ago.In fiscal year 2019, we realized the benefits of a more streamlined and focused company and we executed with discipline. We've made organic investments and targeted acquisitions to shift our portfolio to higher-value, higher-margin offerings. And we made our culture a priority, which has resulted in an 18-point increase in our employee engagement score over the last three years.This reenergized, high-performing team is committed to accelerating what is next for customers and partners. Through these efforts, we improved profitability across the business and significantly exceeded our original non-GAAP earnings and free cash flow guidance.Let's take a closer look at our full fiscal year financial results. Revenue has been stable sequentially the last three quarters with total revenue of $29 billion for fiscal year 2019, down 2% year-over-year when adjusted for Tier 1 and currency. Revenue was impacted by our deliberate action to realign our portfolio as we continue to exit the lower margin Tier 1 server business as well as certain macroeconomic factors.In key areas of strategic investment, we saw strong double-digit growth and reported record revenue for the year in high-performance compute, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, and Composable Cloud. We also continued to see very strong growth in HPE GreenLake orders.I am pleased to report our first annualized revenue run rate of $462 million consistent with the outlook we provided at our Security Analyst Meeting last month. This metric is to help investors track our progress and better value the recurring and higher-margin benefits as we shift our model to as a service.Our non-GAAP gross margin of 32.6% improved 270 basis points year-over-year. This is a key metric because it demonstrates our success transition into higher-margin and recurring revenue. Our non-GAAP operating profit of $2.8 billion grew 4% year-over-year.We delivered fiscal year 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.77, an improvement of 20% year-over-year and well above our original and revised guidance. We improved the quality and quantity of our free cash flow, generating $1.7 billion, which represent growth of 58% year-over-year, even after $668 million arbitration award payment to DXC. These strong results allow us to make significant investments in our R&D spending, which was up 10% year-over-year.And as I committed in early 2018, we completed our plan to return $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends over fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019. Our consistent and strong performance in fiscal year 2019 has laid the foundation for the next phase of HPE's journey. HPE is the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company, and we will execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as a service by 2022 as we drive sustainable, profitable growth.Before providing an overview of our business segment performance, I want to note that our view on the macro economy has not materially changed. Ongoing global trade tensions and other geopolitical factors have created uncertainty that contributes to an uneven demand environment. The elongation of sales cycles we experienced since Q2 continues, particularly in larger deals. But against this backdrop, we are confident we have the right strategy that anticipates our customer needs.We live in an edge-to-cloud world. We have gone from simply having a data center to having centers of data everywhere. Data has tremendous value and is critical to our customer success. They need a technology partner that has the expertise, the tools, and a flexible delivery model to help them harness the power of their data across all their clouds and edges.HPE is uniquely positioned to meet these needs and provide a consistent cloud-like experience for apps and data everywhere. Our edge-to-cloud platform delivered as a service gives customers the ultimate in choice and flexibility and control to all their apps and data no matter where they live, so we can deliver outcomes for their businesses.To highlight the full-year performance in our business segments, I will start with Intelligent Edge, which delivered revenue of $2.8 billion, down 2% year-over-year. As we have said previously, we identified some execution issues in North America early this year that impacted revenue, and we have been actively addressing them through both new leadership and segmentation initiatives.I am particularly pleased with the traction in Aruba Services, up 18% in fiscal year 2019, which will contribute to driving profitable growth in the future. Throughout the year, we made substantial R&D and sales investments in our Intelligent Edge business. I am excited about the differentiation we are continuing to build in our portfolio.We developed new products to expand our reach with new customer segments, including the launch of Aruba Instant On, which targets the growing SMB segment, and we have made enhancement to Aruba Central, which is at the heart of our edge-to-cloud platform. It is the only cloud-native, simple-to-use platform that unifies network management, AI-powered insight, and IoT device security for wire, wireless, and WAN networks.In Q4, we launched our revolutionary new CX series switching portfolio. This is the industry's first services-rich networking portfolio designed specifically for today's modern enterprise campus branch and edge data center. It is cloud-ready, easily deployed and simple to manage. This new networking portfolio also lays the intelligent foundation required for future AI-powered automation.We are seeing traction in the fast-growing and competitive Wi-Fi 6 enterprise access point market. In September, industry analysts showed Aruba taking an early market lead position in delivering Wi-Fi 6 infrastructure. Our Aruba 8000 Series core switches that run our advanced operating system, ArubaOS-CX attracted more than 80 new logos per month, and we continue to see new customers turn into Aruba solutions to provide unique and better experiences to their employees and customers at the edge.Recent examples include the Kentucky Administrative Office of Courts, who was looking for a solution to manage the evolving demands of a digital workplace in the network of 120 courtrooms. Critical to their decision was Aruba Central for its single pane of glass and Aruba ClearPass security to increase visibility and control of the network.U.S. supermarket chain, Giant Eagle, selected Aruba switches and the Aruba AirWave network management platform to minimize business latency, optimize operational manageability and rollout services quickly to help the IT staff become more proactive. And Carnegie Mellon University purchased Aruba Meridian location services platform in conjunction with AppMaker to help them build their smartphone app with wave-finding services.Eventually, this deployment will cover the entire 5 million square foot campus, serving 14,500 students and 3,000 faculty as well as campus visitors. More and more enterprises are understanding how critical Intelligent Edge is to their digital transformations. Business outcomes will depend on the experiences they can deliver at the edge.HPE declared the opportunity of the edge early on, and we continue to make important investments and enhancement to our portfolio and execution to deliver differentiated capabilities and solutions.Turning to Hybrid IT. Our investment in higher-value products and as a service offerings is paying off. Our operating profit of 12.3% for the year was up 210 basis points from fiscal year 2018. Revenue of $22.8 billion was down 3% when adjusted for Tier 1 and currency.Importantly, we saw strong double-digit performance in key areas of the business. High Performance Compute grew 15% in the full-year, Composable Cloud grew 47% and Hyperconverged Infrastructure grew 25%. And also this year, HPE Apollo and HPE Synergy each achieved more than a $1 billion in revenue for the first time.HPE GreenLake continues to be one of our fastest-growing businesses. Orders were up 39% in constant currency in fiscal year 2019. Our ability to deliver a consistent cloud-like experience on and off-premises as a service with HPE GreenLake is a key competitive advantage for HPE. We saw over 200% GreenLake order growth year-over-year in the channel. Our partners are an important extension of our own sales and technical teams, and they are a powerful force in driving growth.At our Security Analyst Meeting last month, I previewed next generation of our as a service offering. We want to enable our customers to be the broker of services to their enterprise by giving them visibility, access and control across public, private and edge workloads. Stay tuned for a very exciting announcement in early December.HPE Pointnext services orders including Nimble orders grew 1% in fiscal year 2019. Going forward, our favorable shift to higher value solutions should continue to drive service intensity with higher services attach rates. In our Composable Cloud portfolio, earlier this month, we integrated HPE Primera, our intelligent storage platform with HPE Synergy and HPE Composable Rack, accelerated speed and agility to deliver new apps and innovations to propel customers businesses.Just last week, we unveiled our new HPE Container Platform. HPE is the first and only vendor to provide a Kubernetes-based container platform that can support the deployment of any enterprise application, whether it was developed as a cloud native or as a virtualized enterprise application.The platform is built on our BlueData container-based software platform with a new open-source Kubernetes orchestration engine and integration with MapR's unique file system that can provide persistent data, addressing a key challenge in Kubernetes.And in our high performance compute business, just last week, we announced the industry's most comprehensive HPC and AI portfolio for the exascale area with a combination of HPE and Cray. We are proud that 21 of the 50 largest systems on the top 500 supercomputer list are now HPE and Cray systems.Against a tougher market backdrop, storage experienced a modest revenue decline of 2%. However, we continued momentum in key strategic areas, HPE Nimble reported record revenues, up 35% in constant currency for the year.Finally, no matter what stack our customers choose, we want to differentiate the hybrid cloud experience with the right software-defined innovation tools. Customers are looking for a simplified and automated experience. This is why we took steps to embed HPE InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform across our workload optimized portfolio that includes Simplivity, 3 PAR, ProLiant, Synergy and Apollo.Here are a few examples of how customers are putting our technology to use to drive key business outcomes. Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, a state-owned enterprise of India has selected our storage technology paired with HPE GreenLake to help them manage their critical data with consumption-based services.Previously, they have been grappling with rightsizing their infrastructure for unpredictable data growth. However, now as one of our largest HPE GreenLake customers, they will be able to flexibly adjust capacity without over-provisioning.Since 2017, we have been working with the EPFL Blue Brain Project, a Swiss brain research initiative that is focused on building a biologically detailed digital reconstruction and simulation of the mouse brain. As the Blue Brain Project has progressed in their scientific roadmap in neuroscience research modeling large and larger brain regions, they have needed to exponentially increase compute power, which they are now doing with a major new upgrade of 880 HPE SGI Apollo 8600 notes.Turning to HPE Financial Services. Fiscal year revenue of $3.6 billion is flat when adjusted for currency, while operating profits increased 70 basis points. HPEFS best-in-class loss ratios drove a strong return on equity of 16%. HPEFS serves as the financial engine behind our as a service offering, giving customers flexibility in how they consume their IT solutions by bringing our robust balance sheet with over $13 billion of net portfolio assets.HPEFS saw strong double-digit growth in its as a service revenue this year. HPEFS differentiates our value proposition is strategic to our customers as it helps them manage and monetize their existing assets in new ways. HPEFS plays a major role in helping customers achieve their sustainability goals by promoting the circular economy with its best-in-class asset management business.In summary, I am very pleased with our performance in fiscal year 2019. I remain confident in our ability to deliver strong results in fiscal year 2020 as we continue to shift our portfolio to higher-value, software-defined solutions and execute our pivot to offering everything as a service by 2022 to deliver our edge-to-cloud platform, which will drive sustainable, profitable growth.I'm confident because we have spent the past two years sharpening our focus, never losing sight of our customers and partners and executing with discipline. We've built a world-class leadership team that has reinvigorated our culture and is bring customer-driven innovation to market through our own R&D and through strategic partnerships and acquisitions.We have the right strategy that will enable us to deliver exceptional edge-to-cloud experiences for our customers that are unmatched in the industry. This is an exciting place to be as we begin the new year.With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to walk you through our results in more detail. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. Now let me provide you more detail on our financial results for the quarter and the full-year 2019. As I have done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to better highlight our performance in the fourth quarter and our fiscal year.Starting with Slides 1 to 3, I'd like to first talk about the key highlights for the full-year 2019. In fiscal year 2019, we continue to pivot our portfolio towards higher margin and more recurring revenue that will lay the foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. We've executed on our strategy with great discipline and despite an uneven macro environment, we maintained sequentially stable revenue for the last three quarters.And we did this while significantly expanding non-GAAP gross margins, which improved by 270 basis points this year, driven primarily by structural improvements including product mix and cost of sales efficiencies. Our gross margin improvements have enabled us to make further investments in the business, while simultaneously delivering growth in non-GAAP operating profit.The combination of margin expansion and below the line benefits including share buybacks, resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $1.77, which is up 20% year-over-year and well above our original outlook of $1.51 to $1.61 provided at SAM in October 2018.On the cash front, we generated significantly higher levels of free cash flow this fiscal year of $1.7 billion, which was up 58% compared to the prior year. I'll talk more about that later in the presentation.On the acquisition front, we successfully closed the Cray transaction in September, well ahead of schedule. While the financial impacts of Cray were minimal in fiscal year 2019, we expect to derive more material benefits in fiscal year 2020 and beyond.Finally, we also delivered on our capital returns program commitment over fiscal year 2018 and 2019 returning $7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends per our original commitment made in early 2018.Now turning to Slide 4 for the quarter results. We finished the quarter with non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.49, which was above our previously provided outlook of $0.43 to $0.47 and up 14% from the prior year. GAAP diluted net EPS for the quarter was $0.36 above the previously provided outlook of $0.24 to $0.28 primarily due to the benefits from the termination of a Tax Matter Agreement with HP, Inc. that was established at the time of the separation.Moving onto a macro view of the business on Slide 5. As Antonio mentioned, our view of the macroeconomic environment remains largely unchanged with uneven demand. Trade tensions and geopolitical factors continue to cause business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals similar to what we called out during the prior two quarters. However HPE's broad portfolio and global footprint makes us well diversified to handle choppy markets, which has enabled us to stabilize revenue in the last three quarters.We will now move to Slide 6 that shows our performance in the quarter by segment. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge, we've made sales leadership changes and introduced new segmentation to improve our go-to-market execution. We believe the Edge remains the next big opportunity, which is why we've continued to make significant R&D and sales investments, despite pressuring near-term profitability.We now have an enhanced go-to-market and a full suite of differentiated solutions that can also be consumed as a service. Going forward, we are expecting a meaningful improvement in profitability as these investments begin yielding benefits and revenue returns to growth as fiscal year 2020 progresses.In Hybrid IT, we continue to grow our higher-margin compute offerings with Composable Cloud growing at 21%, reaching a record level of $1 billion in annual revenues this year and our Apollo offerings, which power the high performance compute portfolio also reaching a record $1 billion in annual revenues. These organically developed offerings demonstrate the strength of our innovation engine.With respect to units, excluding Tier 1 and China, our server units have been growing sequentially since Q2 of fiscal year 2019 and were up year-over-year. Within storage, we continued making great strides in the entry level and mid-range storage markets with notable strength in Nimble Storage, which grew 2%. Hyperconverged Infrastructure, which will be reported in storage starting the next quarter, grew at 14%.In our services business, Pointnext operational services orders including Nimble orders were flat this quarter, but up 1% on a full-year basis in constant currency. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit was up across all hardware categories this quarter. Services intensity reached record levels in value compute and storage, which were both up over 20% year-over-year. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to improve.GreenLake orders, which have 100% services attach rates, grew by an impressive 72% year-over-year to record levels demonstrating strong execution in pivoting to our as a service offerings.Within HPE Financial Services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets which was up 1% in constant currency this quarter, with longer contract term supporting GreenLake and we maintained a strong return on equity which exceeded 15% again this quarter.And while not shown on the slide, Communications and Media Solutions or CMS is a strategically important business providing software capabilities to telcos, which is showing improved momentum. Orders in CMS were up 17% year-over-year due to improved execution selling software licenses. We are excited about the opportunity for CMS to collaborate across all businesses to capitalize on the 5G momentum and growth opportunity with service providers.Slide 7 shows our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 in Q4 is well above our previously provided outlook of $0.43 to $0.47 due to operational outperformance and favorable other income and expense. This marks the 10th quarter in a row that we have exceeded the high-end of our non-GAAP quarterly outlook.As a reminder, we ended fiscal year 2017 with a non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations of $0.94. Based on our fiscal year 2019 diluted non-GAAP EPS performance of $1.77, we have demonstrated tremendous progress in non-GAAP EPS, which has grown by over 88% in the last two years. We have been able to achieve this through significant expansion of gross margin and operating margins, which I will talk about next.Turning to gross margins on Slide 8. We continue to deliver significant year-over-year gross margin expansion as we focus on profitable growth in Hybrid IT, shifting our portfolio towards higher-value, higher gross margin offerings and more recent commodity tailwinds.Non-GAAP gross margins of 33.3% was up 260 basis points year-over-year and up 500 basis points since Q1 of fiscal year 2018. This has been possible through a combination of portfolio mix shift, HPE Next initiatives and commodity tailwinds.Now moving to Slide 9. We continue to make significant investments in R&D and sales to support future revenue growth, while driving significant non-GAAP operating margin expansion. HPE Next has enabled us to redirect investments back into the business, including a double-digit increase this year in R&D to drive organic innovation in our higher margin, faster growth areas of the portfolio and additional investments in go-to market through improved sales effectiveness.We expect to drive revenue productivity and growth in the upcoming quarters from these strategic investments. Meanwhile, non-GAAP operating margins has climbed over 10%, up 290 basis points versus Q1 2018.Turning to cash flow on Slide 10. Free cash flow was seasonally very strong at $878 million in Q4. On a full-year basis, we generated significantly higher levels of free cash flow of $1.7 billion that is up over $600 million or 58% versus the prior year, driven primarily by higher profitability and lower HPE Next payments. Underpinning our year-to-date free cash flow performance is an improvement of over $1 billion or 35% in our cash flow from operations relative to last year.It is important to note that in the $1.7 billion figure, we absorbed the unexpected arbitration payment of $668 million made to DXC. We also had a $200 million benefit from terminating the Tax Matter Agreement with HP, Inc. Most importantly, even without the payment from HP, Inc., we would have been at the midpoint of our original FY 2019 guide of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion.Looking forward into fiscal year 2020, it is important to consider some puts and takes as you model out free cash flow. We expect cash earnings will increase with growing profitability and we expect to receive another charge of $50 million from HP, Inc. related to the termination of the Tax Matters Agreement.We will also need to make capital investments in our as a service offerings and make integration payments related to Cray that will drive future revenue and profit growth. As a result, we continue to expect fiscal year 2020 free cash flow to be between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion.Slide 11 shows the ARR slide I had discussed at our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. Please reference the SAM presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q4 2019 ARR actuals came in line with our guidance at SAM at $462 million. Looking forward, we feel confident we can achieve our growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022.Slide 12 shows our capital returns to-date. We returned $431 million to shareholders during the quarter. We paid $147 million in dividends and repurchased $284 million worth of shares in the quarter.At this point, we have completed our $7 billion capital returns program over fiscal year 2018 and fiscal year 2019, returning $4.1 billion in fiscal year 2018 and $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2019. It is also important to note that we have also recently raised our dividend payment from $0.1125 per share to $0.12 per share, an increase of 7%.Now turning to our outlook on Slide 13. At our recent Securities Analyst meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year 2020. I would encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook.Having said that let me reiterate a few key points of our outlook. From a topline perspective, we expect to grow our fiscal year 2020 revenue adjusted for currency fluctuations. Also we expect to grow our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP operating profit by 4% to 6%.Consequently, we expect fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be a $1.78 to $1.94 and fiscal year 2020 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be a $1.01 to $1.17. For Q1, 2020, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $0.20 to $0.24 per share and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.46 per share.Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance in the quarter and the fiscal year 2019. We have successfully demonstrated that our business is resilient to macro softness and can generate substantial amounts of free cash flow.We have the right strategy and have laid a strong foundation for the years to come. We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher margin software defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge-to-cloud platform offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long-term.Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kathryn Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. As we look into the January quarter, do you have any thoughts around the revenue trajectory? Just looking at street expectations for a revenue increase of 2% to 3% from the October quarter, but since the spin from HP, there isn't a consistent seasonality and in fact, revenues have been flat to down in past January quarters? Tarek Robbiati : Hi, Katy. Good afternoon. It's Tarek here. So, as a broad reminder on fiscal year 2020, we do expect to grow revenue adjusted for currency overall. Now when you specifically get into the Q1 of fiscal year 2020, you have two effects to take into consideration.Number one, the reality that we're operating in is different than one it was in fiscal year 2018 owing to the macro environment. Number two, we will consolidate the contribution of revenue from Cray in full for the first quarter.So, on the whole, we do expect within the context of what I mentioned and with seasonality that we will grow revenue for the full-year, and on a first quarter basis will be roughly flat sequentially relative to where we stand right now. Kathryn Huberty : Okay, that's helpful. And Tarek, how should we think about the contribution from lower commodity costs on gross margin of the 260 basis point gross margin expansion? How much of that would you say is from commodity costs? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So far, as we explained at SAM and even in prior earnings releases, some of the gross margin expansion is structural in nature as a result of the products and the mix of what we sell, and the remainder is driven by commodities. So, I would say 50/50 is the rough split between what is structural and mix related on one side versus commodities on the other.We feel that the commodities environment is probably at best it could be right now and is going to continue for a little bit. The question is how long will that be continuing for. We do believe that the profitability level that we are experiencing right now are there to stay for at least couple of quarters. Antonio Neri : And I will Katy, couple of things. One thing I am pleased is our discipline with pricing. I think the team has done a very good job, despite the changes in commodity price and to drive the right configuration for the right workloads and the right pricing, which as you can see, we have achieved what I believe a record year of profitability in the Hybrid IT business.But as we talked before, the structural changes continue to be there because obviously the systems with more IP built into it, particularly with software defined as well as the configuration for density and more data kind of driven type of configurations give us the confidence on that AUP stability as we go along. Tarek Robbiati : Great. Thank you, Katy. I appreciate it. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could just comment on the demand in macro environment. I know you use the term stable a lot in terms of revenue stability. But if we look at the metrics that you like to use most, which is, I think the most accurate which is ex-Tier 1 at constant currency, it's gone from plus 1 in Q2 to minus 3 in Q3 to minus 7 in Q4, and the comparisons are really not all that different and if anything you had a bit of Cray this quarter?And so at least on the surface, it appears as though the macro environment might be becoming more challenging and you've had a number of other enterprise players suggest that. So perhaps you can provide us with an update on the macro environment, and if you do believe it's relatively stable then why are we seeing this deceleration in revenue trajectory? And I have a follow-up, please. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thanks, Toni for the question. As I said our macro economy view has not changed \u2013 materially changed from Q2 since we started talking about this, but I will say, Toni there has been two halves here.The first half, obviously, coming in from a strong 2018 with inflationary commodity costs. Obviously, Tarek can talk a little bit more about the tax reform and what that did, and in some pent up demand on some modernization that needs to take place because of digital transformation.And then the second half, more driven by the tariff situation with the global trade, some geopolitical instability and then the deflationary side of the commodities. We saw unit increase in Q4 of 2%. So, I think, listen, the elongated sales cycles continue to be there. We believe the demand is there. It's just a matter of timing in many ways, and obviously customers are looking at where to spend the dollars. And I would say a lot of dollars are spent to make sure they can harness the power of the data as fast as possible because that's the value of doing this.But obviously, if we stay in this environment, there will be always a little bit more questions out there. So hopefully, we're going to get the result one way or the other one. But I am still very hopeful about the future because obviously this digital transformation continues to be there and continue to accelerate, and the data continues to explode about around that 7. Tarek, do you have any additional comment on that? Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Thank you, Antonio. I'd like to add some comments on the impact that tax reform has had on the industry. We've done a fair bit of work on this internally, and there is no doubt that the fiscal year 2018 was propelled by the benefits from tax reform, i.e. there was more disposable income for large corporates worldwide to be spent on infrastructure, and that has happened \u2013 that carried on pretty nicely all the way on to the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.Beyond that point, there was a drop due to macroeconomic factors, but also we do believe that there is an element where the spend that was taking place in fiscal year 2019 has to be digested by the companies moving forward. So, in simple terms, I'd say the tide has come down in fiscal year 2019 relative to fiscal year 2018, and that digestion is taking place.So year-over-year compares, which give rise to the calculations you've \u2013 you put forward, Toni. By the way, your calculations are correct. The year-over-year compares are lesser and less relevant in the context where you do have to assume that this infrastructure is to be digested.And what's important for us is to see that the revenue remaining stable should bode well for the future as continuous demand for data will get to a point where that capacity that has been essentially consumed in fiscal year 2018 will be needing to be refreshed in the upcoming quarters. So hopefully that provides you with a color on the year-over-year comparison. Antonio Neri : And I will say, Toni, one more thing is that our revenue for the last quarter has been stable. So despite all of this, our revenue would be stable for three consecutive quarters. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you for that \u2013 I know you've made some very conscious decisions about exiting Tier 1 and focusing on higher value products. But just on a reported basis, your revenue is down $1.7 billion or about 6%, and so the question is, in light of a smaller topline, do you have to sort of take out incremental costs because you have a lower revenue base and how do we think about that like as HPE all done or is there more?Do you feel you need to take out more cost and certainly at least in this quarter, you seem to have very tight control over OpEx even R&D, which have been growing all year seem to have come down this quarter, despite Cray?So maybe you can comment on in light of a top line albeit somewhat driven by your own decisions being down, whether you need to take out incremental cost and how specifically you're thinking about OpEx and whether Q4 was really a sign of what we should expect going forward? Tarek Robbiati : Sure. So like Antonio said, Toni, the revenue for us was stable hovering above the $7.2 billion mark for Q2, Q3 and Q4. What's interesting in this is the underlying profitability of the revenue has materially improved as a result of some actions that we have taken shifting the mixed structural improvements in the products, et cetera.So the underlying EPS and you could see it also from an operating cash flow standpoint has been improving materially, although the revenue is stable. So EPS for Q2, we were at $0.42, for Q3, we were at $0.45 and for Q4 we were at $0.49. So we are extracting more and more value over a revenue base that is stable.In saying that, we are not going to cut costs materially to propel our EPS forward in fiscal year 2020. The reason is, we do believe that we have to continue to make the investments in R&D in the key strategic areas of our business, the Edge being one of them. The second one storage as well and you'll see more and more of that in the upcoming quarters.There is always an element of having to apply cost discipline and that is normal in the context of any company and should be expected. We feel that it's important that we stay relatively Nimble in our thinking and on inflate our cost base, too much. But the underlying fundamental trends of data are there and they're playing.That's why we are investing quite significant amounts of dollars in R&Ds in the right category and the performance of our Edge business this year, if you really look at it and what has driven it in the detail, a lot of the underlying operating profit performance is driven by those R&D and FSC investments that we have made to pivot the business to growth in the upcoming quarters. Antonio Neri : So Toni, I will add a couple of things. First of all, if you're asking the question there will be a separate cost reduction program again? No. We are executing our HPE Next. This is the year three, and we are super, super pleased with the outcome and we expect to continue to derive productivity from what we have done in the previous two years. Understand there is one more year to go here, which will complete the program.But as Tarek said, we will always look for opportunities to improve the productivity of the business by improving the way we engage customers and partners, and obviously we still need to get a lot of the benefits of the investment we've made in IT.This year, we invested plus 10% when you look at the year as a whole, plus 10% growth in R&D and FSC and that will also drive productivity in term of growth in the key strategic areas that we're looking for.So we are very proud and pleased with the work we have done and I think we have still a disciplined mentality here to continue to be very, very rigorous about our approach, but I want to make clear that there is no one-off program here, we already have done what we needed to do and that becomes now part of the DNA of the company going forward. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Great. Thanks, Toni. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Can you provide more details on the performance and storage this quarter? If you can talk pricing and demand competition, just wondering what the underlying trends you're seeing there are. And I have a follow-up. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. I mean, storage was down year-over-year, 11%. But when you look at the year, Shannon, it was down 2%, within that, we saw growth in Hyperconverged, which is up 25% for the year and we saw Nimble to a record year of 35%.And we are leveraging now the platform called HPE InfoSight, which you're familiar with, our AI ops platform, that we embedded everywhere, where it is in ProLiant, where it is in our storage business across the entire portfolio, be on Nimble. So we have now Hyperconverged, we leverage it in HPE Primera. Primera for us will be an area of growth going forward.But if you look at the last point of market share, we actually gained 100 basis points in market share last quarter. So in a market, obviously, there has been kind of stop in the growth in the second half and probably decline and we don't have the final figures here, we gained share. So that's why we are very excited about our storage portfolio and obviously is a key strategic area for us.And then with the acquisition of MapR and BlueData storage, now we have a complete portfolio for our customers in the software defined space and that's why we introduced our HP container platform last week. So for the year again, the revenue was down 2%, but in that a lot of growth in key strategic areas and a lot of profit improvements and share gain in the last quarter that was reported. Antonio Neri : And specifically for storage Shannon, if I may add, Storage revenue in Q4 relative to Q3 was marginally up on a sequential basis. This is again another element of the prior answer which is year-over-year compares are of a different nature, given the various effects at play nowadays, but revenue from storage, sequentially Q4 on Q3 was marginally up. Shannon Cross : And pricing, what trends are you seeing there? Given what's going on in commodities? Tarek Robbiati : I think I would say, pricing on storage is stable. Shannon Cross : Okay. Thanks. And then my final question or my second question is just on China. Can you touch on what you're seeing through the joint venture and what that market looks like and maybe some of the trends in terms of using your technology versus H3C's? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. So our set up in China continued to be a point of focus for us. We are pleased with that set up because obviously it allows us to participate in a market that obviously is unique. The indigenous part of the H3C in China continues to grow nicely and obviously we capture that through our dividends.And our portfolio, meaning the HP side of portfolio continue to be sold through that entity because they have the exclusive distributor of products in China, but that has been declining because of the shift between the indigenous products and the green products of HP Green or HP owned products.So overall, in total that business continue to grow, but as always, there is challenges there driven by the same situation we see here. But overall, we are very pleased with the set up and I think it's the right set up at this point in time we are today, considering the global trade tensions. Tarek Robbiati : Great. Thank you, Shannon. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if we could maybe double click on what's happening trend wise in the Intelligent Edge, the HPE Aruba business in that. I think earlier this year, you had talked about some execution issues was hampering this business, and now, I guess, we've got some concern about the macro yet some opportunities from things like Wi-Fi 6. Just if you could maybe walk us through the cross currents and how to think about the trajectory of that line of business? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. First of all, I am excited about the business because it is positioned for where we see the trends in the market, right. So first of all, the digital transformation starts by providing secure connectivity to drive the experiences through the digital transformation.Second, more and more workloads are moving to the edge. And so we have been working on a couple of things. First, our portfolio of products, so we have the best portfolio we had now since the introduction at HP Discover and later in Q3 with Aruba Central, which is the most comprehensive as a service model for both mid-market and enterprise and Aruba Instant On, which is a killer solution for the SMB market, obviously Wi-Fi 6 became available in the second half of 2019.And as I said in my earlier comments, more than one-third of the Wi-Fi 6 and Enterprise was Aruba, but it is early stages, obviously we have to work on our own execution on in North America, which we feel we have put behind us and we feel that that's going to give us momentum as we enter 2020.But in the Aruba portfolio, obviously we sell Aruba and the rest of the portfolio and I will say that the Aruba parts of the portfolio is steady and growing slightly and the other ones were slightly down, but in aggregate, that's where you see the performance. So I know Tarek has few comments to add associated with that. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Thank you, Antonio. So I found the Intelligent Edge, if you look at our presentation and you referred specifically to Slide 3. You will observe that the majority of the operating profit decline is driven by the conscious decision we made to invest in R&D products to equip the Edge with a full suite of products.So more than two-thirds of the operating profit decline year-over-year is a conscious decision we've made to invest in R&D to equip Aruba with a full suite of products and very recently they've launched a number of different solutions including a single operating system to cater for the high end of the market all the way down to branches Wi-Fi 6 Aruba Central.And we feel that now the company is from a portfolio standpoint \u2013 product portfolio standpoint, extremely well positioned for the future, it's been acknowledged by number of industry outage publications, including the Ghana Group, IDC and Forrester Research and there we feel that we are extremely well equipped and positioned for the future with Aruba. Now this puts more emphasis obviously on execution in fiscal year 2020 and we look forward to seeing the fruits of those investments. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Great. Thanks, Simon. Can we get our next question, please? Operator : Our next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Roderick Hall : Yes. Hi guys, thanks for the question. I wanted to start by asking if you've seen any change in the size of customers exhibiting these delays and lower spending patterns, in other words, have you seen it moved from Fortune 100 type customers down to mid markets in any of your business line or in all of them. And then I have a follow-up to that. Antonio Neri : No, no really, I mean what we said is that the elongation sales cycles are really in the mostly in the enterprise space in the larger deals, not in the smaller deals or smaller customer segments. Roderick Hall : Okay, great. Thanks, Antonio. And then the follow-up, I wanted to see maybe Tarek, if you can answer this. With the potential transaction at HPQ changed their commitment to you in terms of financial services in any way or whatever commitment they have with you persist through any sort of potential transaction? Tarek Robbiati : The simple answer to your question is no. There is a contract in place between the parties. We've been working for more than decades with HPI on financing their own equipment. This is incredibly well established and set across the channels. It's incredibly difficult to therefore dislodge HPFS from those channels. We feel very good about this. I don't think a transaction will cause us any palpitations in that regard. Roderick Hall : Okay, great. Antonio Neri : Because of the market we cover, and the vast majority of those customers or channel partners, we have direct relationships anyway. Roderick Hall : Okay, excellent. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Great. Thanks, Rod. Next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thanks. I have two questions and I'll ask them at the same time. So you can decide which to ask first \u2013 answer first or second. So the first one is your sales growth, you mentioned growth for next year, is that with or without Cray? I know you said on a currency as adjusted basis, but I want to be clear is that with or without Cray? And then my second question is your fiscal 2020 EPS outlook is the same from your Investor Day. Does that include more stock buyback and if so how much should we plan on? Thank you. Antonio Neri : The first question is with Cray which is what we said at the Security Analyst Meeting, and Tarek will answer the question on EPS. Tarek Robbiati : So yes remember \u2013 at our Securities Analyst meeting, we said that we would be from a capital management policy return between 50% to 75% of our cash flow to shareholders. And therefore that this would be tracking cash flow, which in turn will be tracking earnings and there is no change to this.We've assumed a certain level of share buybacks, which is \u2013 what is currently implied by the market and the dividend we up the dividend from $0.1125 to $0.12, so you can very easily do the math to understand the level of share buyback that is implied by the figures, I've just quoted to you. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details. That's greatly appreciated. Tarek Robbiati : Great. Thank you, Jim. I think we have time for one last question, please? Operator : Our final question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have one question and a follow-up as well. As we think about the impacts of component pricing dynamics and it sounds like the positive trends might continue here for a little bit with regard to the business in the gross margin.I'm just curious, is there any kind of framework you can help us understand of how much mix has played a part within the server category, particularly any comments on how much content growth you've seen from say DRAM or memory, in general, just trying to think about the structural kind of sustainability of those trends going forward? Tarek Robbiati : Okay. So you may recall from my speech that I made a comment with respect to units, and we explained that when you look at the units of what we sell excluding Tier 1s and China, our server units have been growing sequentially since the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, and they were up 2% year-over-year in Q4 with higher services intensity.So this is really the key driver of our earnings performance in Q3 and Q4, and we see those trends continue, although now most of what we sell is Gen10 on the server side. We do believe that the configurations that customers require to cater for the exponential growth of data are closing ultimately to see units going up and eventually AUP after phase of deceleration will start to go up again. So that's what we are seeing in the medium to long-term. Antonio Neri : Obviously, we have taken actions ourselves to take advantage of the supply, pricing, and as you know, we do a lot of long-term supply arrangements as they become available. But in the end, the structure of the systems, particularly as the Generation 11 comes online, that will drive again another structural change in our AUPs because of the configurations. Aaron Rakers : That's helpful. And then as a second follow-up question. On the storage business as we think about the product portfolio, I know you mentioned strong growth in Nimble, but I'm just curious of where we're at with the Primera product? When do we expect that to really start to materialize from a revenue standpoint?And just remind us how much of your business in storage is related to more of those higher end platforms? I think that that's founded on the legacy 3PAR platform. I'm just trying to think about the refresh opportunity as you look through this next several quarters what that might present? Antonio Neri : Yes. I mean, we have received very strong accolades and interest on HP Primera, and remember HP Primera, we don't sell it just as a part of our independent storage appliance, but we sell it as a part of a Composable Cloud. And with integration, with both HP Synergy and HP Composable rack as a block of IT that has all the software defined intelligent and automation including HP InfoSight.And obviously our strength has been mostly in the mid-range market and, but the high-end is very \u2013 is a market that's very interesting for us and we are rolling that as we speak, and I believe throughout 2020, will be a driving force for growth for us.Generally, the market is actually moving in a direction that's more software-defined. And that's why HP InfoSight is a key component of HP Primera for us, because it's mostly softer on appliance-based driven solution, but it is actually the software that makes that unique. Aaron Rakers : Thank you very much. Tarek Robbiati : Great. Thank you, Aaron. Tarek Robbiati : So I think we're unfortunately out of time for questions. But, Antonio, let me turn it over to you for any final comments. Antonio Neri : Well, as always thank you for joining us today. I just wanted to wrap up by saying I believe we had another very strong year. This is the second year as a CEO and we did what we said we would do. I think we have achieved record level of profitability, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. I will emphasize the free cash flow because we actually improved cash flow by 58%.We are on track to deliver that normalized cash flow. We have spoken many, many times and we are very, very confident that $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. What I'm really pleased is about the execution in the business with disciplined by pivoting the business and excited about the future without forgetting the fact that the culture of the company as it plays a huge role and I couldn't be more pleased and proud of the work we have done here. So thanks again for joining us today and hopefully see you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call today. Thank you.",

Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today. HPE\u2019s first quarter results demonstrate continued progress against our strategic priorities to shift our company to higher margin and more recurring revenues against a dynamic market backdrop. I am disappointed that our overall revenue is $6.9 billion, reflects a 7% decline for the quarter, primarily due to declines in our compute business. However, I am pleased with the results in several key areas of our business aligned to our strategy. Our pivot to as-a-service is gaining momentum. Our annualized revenue run rate grew 19% year-over-year. We started reporting this new metric last quarter to provide more transparency into the recurring and higher margin benefits of shifting to our as-a-service model. We grew HPE GreenLake services\u2019 orders 48% year-over-year. HPE GreenLake gained 65 new logos in Q1 and has surpassed 800 total customers. We returned to growth in our Intelligent Edge business with revenue up 4% year-over-year and we continue to see profitable growth in areas of investment including High Performance Compute, Hyperconverged Infrastructure, Big Data Storage and Operational Services orders with continued improvements in our services attach intensity. Our Q1 revenues were impacted by a number of factors. First, like many of our peers, we continue to see uneven and unpredictable demand due to macro uncertainty. This has resulted in longer sales cycles and delayed customer decisions. Second, commodity supply constraints disrupted our ability to meet our customer's demand this quarter, particularly in our compute and high performance compute businesses. Additionally, the outbreak of the coronavirus at the end of January impacted component manufacturing resulting in higher quarter and backlogs. In both of these cases, we have established specific mitigation and recovering plans with each of our suppliers. Finally, we encountered a challenge in consolidating a manufacturing site in North America. We have a plan in place to address the Q1 issue and are confident that our efforts will result in increased efficiency and agility as we move forward. It is important to note that even with the revenue shortfall, we improved our non-GAAP gross margin by 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2%. We drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44, up 5% year-over-year and inline with our outlook, while also invest in for future innovation. And we delivered improved free cash flow compared to last year's level and in line with Q1 normal seasonality. While market uncertainty continues and new global developments like the coronavirus have emerged, we have taken the right actions to mitigate against these evolving dynamics. Some of these actions includes further cost account in our backend operations as a part of our HPE Next program, which has been a key enabler of our gross and operating margin improvement. We had extended the program through fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. As Tarek will cover in more detail because of the actions we have taken to address the uncertainty and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. We are comfortable maintaining our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS outlook, but there are too many unknowns at this point to provide second quarter guidance. Also, we do feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year 2023 cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Given that we expect some impact on cash conversion cycles driven by the ongoing recovery from supply constraints and the impact of the coronavirus. These are the right pragmatic actions to take and I am confident in our ability to deliver in our strategy. Our customers continue to reaffirm their need for hybrid capabilities to advise their digital transformations and harness the power of their data, whatever it lives in the cloud, on and off premises and increasingly at the edge. As the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company, HPE is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these trends and help our customers to transform. Before Tarek provides more specifics about the quarter, let me highlight a few of our business and segment results. First, our Intelligent Edge business outperformed competitors across the industry. We grew in all geographies posting double-digit growth in North America despite the challenging macro environment and we delivered double-digit growth in our Aruba branded products. Over the last two quarters, we have been actively enhancing our sales coverage model in North America and I am proud of the team hard work and our momentum. We declared the opportunity at the Intelligent Edge early and we continue to invest in bringing in a cloud experience to the Edge where data is increasingly created. At the core of the strategy is HPE Aruba Central, the only cloud native and simple to use platform that unifies network management, AI-power insights and IoT device security for wire, wireless and WAN networks and soon 5G and edge computing. More than 58,000 unique customers are using Aruba Central. In Q1, Aruba, which pioneered the software-defined branch solution for deployment and management of large retail networks further enhance our solution by integrating Aruba branch gateways with Aruba Central by providing a single point of control for SD1 wire and wireless networking. Aruba can help customers achieve secure simplified brunch connectivity at scale. Our customers continue to recognize our innovation at the edge. For instance, in the first quarter, the office of information technology at Princeton University turned to ArubaOS-CX to support its wire initiative and seamlessly integrate with Aruba wireless with a goal of creating a complete Mobile-First Campus of the future. Sub-Zero a leading looks to the appliance maker updated its wired with wireless infrastructure through ArubaOS-CX and Instant wireless to support IoT in high-end appliances. Both our ArubaOS-CX and Wi-Fi 6 solutions continue to gain traction in the market. The customer examples I share are a testament of our differentiated innovation. I am excited about how our market leadership is helping customers to redefine experiences at the edge. We will continue to enhance our portfolio with integration of 5G and mobile edge computing to capitalize on this significant opportunity. Turning to Hybrid IT, as we announced at our Securities Analyst Meeting last fall, we are providing revenue and operating profit disclosures in four business segments : Compute, High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems, Storage, and Advisory and Profession Services aligned to customer demands and market trends. Tarek will walk you through the financial results in greater detail and let me share a few high level observations. As I noted earlier, our compute revenue was impacted by a combination of factors and came in lower than anticipated for the quarter. However, we did see an acceleration in unit volumes, which were up mid single digits year-over-year, excluding Tier 1 in China. Our High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems segment includes the first full quarter of Cray. We are excited about the combination of HPE and Cray and the growing time. We have been awarded more than $2 billion in HPC business expected to be delivered in the next three years. Programs include the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s El Capitan System at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Frontier supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory among others. Our new segmentation provide greater insights in through the size, strength and attractive financial profile of our HPE Storage business, which is $5 billion business with an operating margin of 18%. We gained momentum in key areas during the quarter and expect to gain share in external disk. Big Data storage grew 45% year-over-year and demonstrates early success with our MapR acquisition. Hyperconverged Infrastructure also continued to grow up 6%. HPE InfoSight, our cloud-based AI operations platform gained momentum across both storage and compute. I am proud of our focused efforts and innovation that have created one of the most comprehensive intelligent data platform in the industry, which will continue to provide customers with superior simplicity and performance. Our Advisory & Professional Services business provides strategy, technology planning and consultant services that help customers navigate their digital transformation from edge to cloud. With the increased focus and simplification of this business, we draw demand across the HPE portfolio and significantly expanded operating margins this quarter, up 12.5 points year-over-year. Our customer wins demonstrate the strength of our strategy and breadth of our portfolio. For example, HPE was recently selected by Zenuity, a joint venture between Volvo Cars and Veoneer to help make next generation autonomous driving cars reality. HPE will provide the crucial AI and High Performance Compute and required to gather, store, organize and analyze data from its global network test vehicles and software development centers. The end to end solution will be delivered as-a-service through HPE GreenLake. [Indiscernible] a global electronics company wanted to reduce storage complexity and reclaim claim management time. Already relying on three parts for business critical applications, the company chose nimble storage to help manage that 20% year-over-year growth in data. This new combination has improved performance threefold. Volkswagen Group selected HPE to deliver state-of-the-art Compute & Mission Critical servers to run its apps and solutions like SAP HANA, virtual desktop infrastructure and others focused on Big Data Analytics, AI and autonomous driving. Our offerings such as HPE Superdome Flex, HPE ProLiant Gen10 servers and HPE Pointnext support services will power the data and apps for the Volkswagen Group\u2019s 12 global brands. In Q1, we continue to accelerate innovation. We achieved a major milestone in our pivot to as-a-service with the launch of HPE GreenLake central platform. HPE GreenLake central is an advanced cloud platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all the application and data wherever they live through an operational console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid estate. We launched our HPE Container Platform, which is the first enterprise grade Kubernetes-based container solution. It leverages HPE\u2019s acquisition of BlueData and MapR together with 100% open-source Kubernetes software. This platform provides customers with a common and faster path to run legacy and cloud-native applications with persistence/storage connectivity. And we acquired Scytale, an innovative software company focused on service authentication. The Scytale team are the founding contributors to two open-source projects that they are positioned to become the de facto standards for identifying and securing enterprise workloads both on and off premises. Our Scytale acquisition is consistent with our targeted approach to M&A that brings critical talent and complementary technologies to HPE. We look for accretive value enhancing acquisitions that improve our competitive positioning and accelerate our strategy. Finally, our HPE Financial Services business continues to provide us with the critical competitive advantage. In Q1, overall financing volume increased 2%. GreenLake represented more than 40% of our HPE leasing volume. HPEFS uses multiple leavers to help customers accelerated digital transformations while contributing to the circular economy. Through asset upcycling and accelerated migration HPEFS free up well over $500 million in our customers' budgets over the last two years. This business help our customers capture value from older assets, achieve their sustainability goals, and invest in new technologies as-a-service. As we advance our business objectives to meet our customer needs and deliver for our shareholders, we continue to be guided by very strong purpose. I am tremendously proud of our environmental stewardship, our investments in our people and our culture of integrity and inclusion. HPE was just recognized as one of the Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere Institute. We were also proud to be named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. These are very important measures of how HPE delivers for our team members, customers, shareholders in our global communities. And similarly in Q1 we face continued macro uncertainty, which combined with supply the manufacturing constraints impacted our revenue, particularly in Compute. Despite, these issues and the current market backdrop, we continue to execute with discipline and make progress against our strategic priorities. We outperformed the market in critical areas like the intelligent edge. We gain traction in High Performance Compute with acquisition of Cray. We advance our people to as-a-service all while delivering EPS and gross margin expansion. While we made progress in these important areas, we know we have work to do to improve in others. We are living in an uncertain time, but what is certain is our commitment to continue to manage our business with focus and discipline. I believe in our sound strategy, in our talented team and in our differentiated technology. This combination will enable us to execute our pivot to provide our customers and partners unique edge-to-cloud experiences delivered as-a-service. By doing so, we expect to deliver long term profitable growth and generate stakeholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to provide more details about the quarter. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much Antonio. Now let me provide more detail on our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I have done before, I'd be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, please note that we are now reporting results according to our new segmentation. This will provide more granular detail on the financial performance of our businesses and our progress towards becoming the edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service company. Please refer to our recently filed Form 8-K for more detailed information, which includes historical reconciliation tables for the last two years. Antonio already discussed the high-level points for the quarter, but I want to briefly reiterate the main takeaway. We are continuing to execute on our transition to higher margin and more recurring revenue areas in a challenging business environment. We also remain confident that we have the right strategy in place and are taking the right actions to lay a foundation for sustainable, profitable growth in the future. Turning to Slide 2, with the financial highlights for the quarter, despite the top line challenges from uneven demand and component supply and manufacturing constraints that I'll provide more detail on shortly, we continued to expand non-GAAP gross margins which improved by 210 basis points this year, driven primarily by portfolio mix shift, cost of services, efficiencies and commodity cost tailwinds. This gross margin expansion combined with other income and expense benefits that included record equity interest contributed from our ownership in HPC and share buybacks resulted in diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 which is up 5% year-over-year and in line with our original outlook for the quarter. On the cash front, free cash flow was a use of $185 million, which was in line with the prior year and normal seasonality. Consistent with our capital management and policy we paid $156 million in dividends and repurchased $204 million in shares. From a macro perspective, as Antonio mentioned, geopolitical factors continue to close business uncertainty, particularly in larger enterprise deals creating an uneven and unpredictable business environment. This was further exacerbated by supply constraints, both component shortages and our North American manufacturing site consolidation which affected the Compute business in particular. We expect component shortages to remain a headwind and this situation to alleviate as we progress through the year. The North American manufacturing site consolidation has created near term execution challenges that we are actively addressing and expect to have improved efficiencies and agilities in our supply chain moving forward. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential disruption to demand and supply caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The health issue is causing disruption to both supply and demand and while we cannot quantify the real impact at this time, we're monitoring the situation closely and are working with our suppliers to minimize potential impacts. We'll now move to Slide 3, that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. I won't take you through every number, but let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew 4%. Our changes to North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off with double-digit growth in North America and 13% growth in overall wireless LAN product. While we continue to make relevant R&D and sales investments this year, we are also delivering significant improvement in profitability with operating margins of 9.7% up 630 basis points year-over-year.  In Compute revenue declined 15% this quarter due to the previously highlighted uneven demand environment, component supply constraints and North American manufacturing site consolidation, yet we delivered a 9.5% operating profit-margin in line with last year. With respect to units excluding Tier 1 in China, our units were up mid-single digits year-over-year and have also been growing sequentially since Q2 2019. In High Performance Compute and Mission Critical Systems, we grew revenue 6% that included our first full quarter contribution from Cray. Our HPC business has been awarded over $2 billion of business that is expected to be delivered through fiscal year 2023. We will also optimize the Cray cost envelope and expect triple digit millions in annualized run rate, cost synergies to be recognized by the end of the next fiscal year significantly adding to the operating profit and margins of HPC and MCS. Within Storage, we made progress against a competitive backdrop, maintaining flat sequential revenues with notable strength in big data growing at 45% year-over-year and Hyperconverged Infrastructure growing at 6% year-over-year this quarter. Note that this is the first quarter, we are reporting Hyperconverged Infrastructure and Storage aligned to our peers. In Advisory & Professional Services, we are reporting for the first time in our new segmentation revenue was flat and we significantly improved operating margins by 12.5 points year-over-year as we focus on eliminating unprofitable business. Operational Services, which is included across compute, HPC and MCS and Storage orders were up 1% year-over-year and revenue was down 2%. Our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per unit, was up year-over-year again in every business segment this quarter with double-digit growth in HPC and MCS, Services Intensity driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. Within HPE financial services, we expanded our net portfolio of assets, which was up 2% in constant currency this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake and we maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again this quarter with bad debt loss ratio of 0.4% which is best-in-class within this industry. And while not shown on the slide, Communications and Media Solutions that is included in our Corporate Investment segment is a strategically important business to us providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. It is showing improved momentum. Orders in CMS were up 10% sequentially and revenue was up 2% due to improved momentum of the telco software and services business. Slide 4 shows the ARR slide that I discussed at our securities analyst meeting in October, 2019. Please reference the SAM presentation for a deep dive into what makes up the ARR. Our Q1 2020 ARR actuals came in at $511 million a 19% year-over-year growth that accelerated from last quarter. Our HPE Aruba Central platform is starting to gain traction with revenue growing triple digits year-over-year. We also continue to see strong growth in GreenLake services orders, which were up 48% year-over-year. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as-a-service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as-a-service, we are confident in achieving our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022. Slide 5, shows our EPS performance to-date, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44 in Q1 is in-line with our previously provided outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 due to disciplined execution, expanding gross margins and favorable other income and expense. This represents year-over-year growth of 5% also, please note our OI&E performance in Q1 of fiscal year 2020 does not change our fiscal year 2020 OI&E outlook. As we foreshadowed during last October, Securities Analyst Meeting, we continue to expect OI&E to be a $0.03 to $0.05 per share headwind in fiscal year 2020. Turning to gross margins on Slide 6, we continue to deliver a significant year-over-year gross margin expansion that was up 210 basis points year-over-year to 33.2% as we shifted to a higher margin offerings like the Intelligent Edge with Aruba Central Hyperconverged Infrastructure, the addition of Cray and commodity cost tailwinds.  Moving to Slide 7, we have continued to improve operating profits since the beginning of Q1 of fiscal year 2018, while making strategic investments in R&D and sales to support long term profitable growth. In Q1 of fiscal year 2020 we're now consolidating a full quarter of additional operating expenses from the Cray acquisition that will be optimized going forward. Furthermore, given the additional uncertainty in the business environment introduced this quarter, we are taking near term actions that will enable us to protect and expand our profitability in fiscal year 2020, while continuing to make critical long term investments. As Antonio mentioned, we would extend the HPE Next program into fiscal year 2021 and expect incremental savings while maintaining the original net cash impact. Turning to cash flow on Slide 8, operating cash flow declined with revenue $461 million year-over-year. Free cash flow for Q1 was in-line with normal seasonality at negative $185 million in-line with the prior year, thanks to planned net CapEx benefits in the quarter. Please remember our normal seasonality is for cash to be used in the first half and then we generate significant amounts of free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year. Now as a reminder on Slide 9, we maintained a solid balance sheet with our cash flow generation and we have a disciplined returns based process for evaluating investments and capital returns. We are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating that is evidenced by our current operating net cash position. Consistent with our capital return commitments, in Q1 we returned $360 million in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As part of our capital allocation framework, we also target value enhancing acquisitions to improve our competitive positioning and to accelerate our strategy of pivoting to as-a-service that provides us with higher levels of recurring revenue and profitability. As with any investment we consider, we follow a rigorous evaluation process, cognizant of size, valuation, financial impact, such as accretion, dilution, and strategic fit. Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 10, as discussed, we are in an increasingly uneven business environment, but at this point we're comfortable maintaining our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS outlook of a $1.78 to a $1.94 given the cost actions we plan to take and the expected recovery of supply chain constraints over time. However, there's still considerable uncertainty in the short term due to the unknown potential impacts from the coronavirus, so we're not in a position to provide our second quarter outlook. From a cash flow perspective and given our negative cash conversion cycle, we expect some current year impact on working capital receivables with elongated sales cycles persisting and the need to build inventory levels due to the supply chain constraints. Consequently, we feel it is prudent to revise our fiscal year 2020 free cash flow outlook from $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion to $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. We remain committed to our previously announced capital management policy of returning 50% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders and now expect to be at the higher end of that range for fiscal year 2020. Overall, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities within an uneven environment and introduce new challenges this quarter. We're taking the appropriate actions to navigate the near term uncertainty while executing against our vision and strategy that is really resonating with customers. We will continue to shift our portfolio to higher margin software defined solutions and focus on delivering our edge to cloud platform, offering our full portfolio as a service by 2022. This will ultimately drive sustainable, profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long term. Now with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. Tarek, how much do you think that temporary factors like component constraints, the supply chain disruption can coronavirus and the factory consolidation in North America had on total revenue. And then as a follow-up, Antonio, given how important revenue growth is for stock price performance and valuation, can you talk about the investments you're making and the timeline investors should think about to return the company to growth and how dependent is that path on M&A. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Okay. Good afternoon Katy. Thank you for the question. With respect to how much those short term disruptions have accounted for our revenue performance, I would say quite a lot. There are three things that affected our revenue performance. These are the macro environment softness. The second thing is supply chain constraints. And the third one is also the manufacturing north consolidation in North America. We've taken steps to address what's under our control. Nonetheless, coronavirus has effected the tail end of the quarter and injected a new degree of uncertainty. And when you look at the revenue performance of the company, most of the decline came in the Compute category that we referred to in our new segmentation and that decline has a lot to do with what you referred to from a supply chain standpoint. Antonio Neri : Yes. Good afternoon Katy. And thanks for the question and just will add to Tarek that we felt pretty good about the recovery in the north consolidation that's under our control. All the other factors Tarek explained very well. In term of, when think about investment long term, we have been very clear where we want to invest. Investment obviously is in Intelligent Edge. We see that as a next frontier, big opportunity for us. We continue to do so. And I have to say I'm incredibly pleased with the Q1 performance because we said that business would return to growth and we show, we demonstrated that\u2019s the case.  We outperformed the market and every single competitor there and we are very, very pleased with the differentiation we have with our portfolio with higher margin. So for us, that's one area of investment, much of that growth has happened organically. But we always look for what it makes sense for us in term of accretive addition in term of intellectual property and talent, right, that we want to continue to expand that set of experience we deliver at the edge. And as I said in my opening remarks, we are on a journey to integrate 5G and mobile edge computing on a very robust cloud based solution called HPE Aruba Central, which is all subscription base and obviously we can deliver that through GreenLake. Obviously the other piece of this is what I call intellectual property to make our core business stronger. And that's all softer decline on the core with some additional call it intellectual property in the Silicon space. That's what the core of the Cray acquisition was all about. The Cray acquisition is all about software in a cloud native environment to run these big data intensive workloads. And silicone was all about that. And as I think about the pivot as-a-service also we looking for software that will make our as-a-service experience unique and differentiated in a true age to cloud platform. And as I announced in my remarks, we introduced two key platforms. One is HPE GreenLake Central, which is the console, the control point for managing and deploying workloads at the edge in the core on off premises. So we add that managed services layer on top of that and then the container platform, which is a true cloud native environment, where you can run both legacy and cloud based workloads. So those are the things we are doing, but I just want to emphasize, we have a very stringent and rigorous process here on return on invested capital. And I see as in M&A as one of the three levels to drive innovation. Organic is one aspect, partnership is the other one and inorganic. And I say that the last 15 acquisition I had been part of it has been always in that vein and that's our goal. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thank you. Katy. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jeriel Ong : Awesome. Thank you, so much. I appreciate you giving me a chance to ask a question. To start off, is there any guidance for revenue for the year and focusing on the quarter itself, could you quantify or for the guided quarter, could you quantify maybe how much below seasonal you think the these coronavirus impacts and supply chain constraints could impact the next quarter? Tarek Robbiati : Okay. So let me start by the second part of your question, which is how much of an impact will the coronavirus have on our business? Well, first as we already flagged the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners is our priority and out of abundance of caution for them, we've made the decision to cancel or postpone most of the HPE sponsors events through April. And unfortunately, this is also closing supply and demand disruptions and effecting our revenue profile. The outbreak at the end of January, started to impact the component manufacturing and resulted in constrained supply and higher quarter-end backlog worldwide. And we have been in constant contact with our suppliers and are establishing specific mitigation and recovery plans. So, this is affecting our revenue profile for the full year. And this is why we're not guiding in the short term and relative to what we said at SAM where we were experiencing \u2013 we were thinking we would be returning to growth in fiscal year 2020. I don't think that it is likely at this stage that we were going fiscal year 2020 as a whole for the fiscal year, but we do anticipate recovery of those supply chain constraints over time and face easier comps during the course of the year. Antonio Neri : I would like to add a couple of comments. One is on the coronavirus. Obviously, this is very fluid at this point in time there is uncertainty. We have a daily process with each of our suppliers that we manage very, very tightly and some of those, the suppliers are dependant on other suppliers. Because as you can imagine that supply chain is a little bit longer with the tier two, tier three suppliers that provide what I call low-level components to build what I call the printed circuit board. So the PCIs or the PCBIs and that's a challenge we see today. And we see recovery, but obviously it's going to take time and that's why Tarek said, we cannot provide right now a definite guidance. I think would be not appropriate and that's why we prefer not to provide Q2, but because of the recovery is going to happen through the year, that we felt comfortable reaffirming the 2020 guidance. If you remember when we went to the Security Analyst Meeting in October, we said that we expect to grow the company on a three years basis, long term plan or 1% to 3%. I think that this is still complete and intact because as you can see, as we pivot the portfolio to higher value and higher margins at the same time, the pivot as-a-service, which is going extremely well, and then obviously Intelligent Edge business growing. That's how we think about the long term growth in the right margin profile. Obviously the Compute at this point in time was the challenge short term. I don't think it was off compared to some of our peers. In fact, in some cases we did better than our peers, but that was a disappointment and obviously we need to stabilize it and manage it through the supply chain recovery. Andrew Simanek : Thank you. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I have a question and a follow-up. First I was wondering if you could provide book-to-bill information or backlog information for the Compute business for this year relative to the end of Q1 last year. I think that would provide incremental confidence and insight into how much of this is component in your inability to fulfill versus how much of this is kind of a demand issue. So, a book-to-bill for Compute this year versus last year and/or backlog for Compute this year versus last year. And I have a follow-up please. Tarek Robbiati : Sure Toni. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. I don't have the book-to-bill but I can tell you we entered Q2 which is the quarter we're in with higher backlog than we anticipated and definitely it is more on the elevated side. And so that's true for Compute and as well a carryover for high performance compute, which are the core of that product. Toni is the legacy HPE Apollo. So we enter Q2 with a higher elevated backlog than we have seen. I don't see yet let me qualify this outside China. I haven't seen yet a significant impact on demand so far. Definitely in China, as you know we have a different setup with our H3C partnership there. And you should expect a short term impact in China. But right now they are working it through it. But I will say right now we haven't seen a significant impact. If anything actually creates short term opportunities. I can tell you because of the coronavirus we see customers coming to us and say, can you ship this product to take care of the fact that my employees are not going to be at work. We see some demand in specific areas of our workload optimized solutions. And as I said in my opening remarks, we do have as an awarded business, which obviously we have to build and ship more than $2 billion in HPC business that we have to ship over the next several quarters in the next two years. And that business is doing very well from my vantage point, but it is obviously segregate in two different segments, compute and on the other hand, HPC and Mission Critical. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Thank you. If I could just follow-up I'd love to get your impression of the stock. It's obviously very beaten down and I'd like your view on that. And you've talked about your openness to doing acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could clarify whether there's a size limit or whether you would go to 10 billion, but also are there other structural moves that you would consider? So would you consider taking on debt and aggressively repurchasing your own shares given the valuation right now like HPQ has done. And would you consider other portfolio moves such as divesting businesses like, just for example, because it's small and orphaned A&PS or other businesses. So how \u2013 what do you think of the stock? How big the acquisition size? Would you think about debt repurchase? And how about divestment? Thank you.. Antonio Neri : And I'm going to start then I'm going to give it to Tarek. Let me talk about the stock. Listen, I think it is a point in, kind of situation in my view, we are heavily discounted. There's no question about it. But think about the last nine quarters, Toni, and think about the gross margin expansion and the EPS expansion we have had. It is pretty remarkable. I mean, the last two years we expanded the margins every single quarter and we have expanded EPS every single quarter. So my vantage point, we have done the right things. We have made the company leaner, meaner, and at the same time we have taken big, big, big challenges. And we have managed it through. So, I think for us is to continue to focus on the areas where we see the opportunity to compete and win in higher margins. But obviously the stock also thinking about long term growth and I understand that and obviously a big component of that is our Compute business, but in the end, I think the stock is heavily discounted. I'm disappointed with that. On the M&A, we have been very clear since day one that we look at assets that they are accessible that generally they are accretive or we can manage the dilution very quickly, but ultimately is, has to have strategic fit. In the context of our strategy, obviously, whether it is the edge-to-cloud architecture and pivot to know as-a-service I think the assets we have acquired makes complete sense from that vantage point and we have delivered strong results. Size is important, but I will say it's more strategic effect and obviously the return on that investment capital, which we have incredible strong discipline and where we have demonstrated at over the last two years. And so, maybe I will pass it now to Tarek because you asked the question about taking debt and buying stock and so forth. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So, Toni, I would say, Antonio answered the question on the stock. I would simply point to you at the performance of the values part of our business, the Intelligent Edge, which has outperformed the sector quite substantially this quarter. What's the value of that? If you look at our storage business, which has done better than most of the players in the market and is of the same size as a very large pure-play listed company, what's the value of that? And if you look at our HPC and MCS business and the $2 billion of backlog contracted revenues that would come in, what's the value of that? And then you have to look at other players in the sector and compare our compute business to them and see that also for those players that compute business is valued negatively from an equity standpoint, but it does generate cash and we have to figure that out. Finally, let me finish by saying HPC, the production was the value of that. It's a listed company and it's pretty substantial. So I'll let you conclude whether the stock is beaten down or not and how much is beaten down and probably in your own question you have the answer. Well, expected acquisitions \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : No, I was just going to say, you basically said I think it's really beaten down, especially on some of the parts. So then are you or why wouldn't you consider much more aggressively repurchasing your own shares at these levels? Tarek Robbiati : So the thing that we \u2013 let me just finish up answering the other part and I'll come back to your question on buying share. With respect to acquisitions, Antonio answered very, very clearly. We remain disciplined in that field when we're not going to look at acquisitions that don't fit our investment criteria from an accretion dilutions standpoint. It's very, very important. We do that. A&PS, specifically for A&PS, it's a very strategic business that pulls a lot of revenue and profits in other parts of the organization and it's essential for enabling the as-a-service pivot. Now coming back on to your question with respect to aggressive buybacks, we did in the past two years execute a $7 billion capital return program to shareholders. We returned 2.9 billion by way of dividends and 4.1 by way of buybacks. And what we did flag at SAM is the fact that we are going to continue to return capital to shareholders in line with our free cash flow generation capacity. We're not going to deviate from this because it's important that we continue to think about the long-term value of those businesses and each one of those businesses has its own investment profile and needs to be therefore catered for. Antonio Neri : Thank you. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Toni. Andrew Simanek : Thanks, Toni. Antonio Neri : Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking the question. I wanted to look more at your cost cutting actions. I think you talked about taking actions during the current quarter, which maybe curtailing travel, which obviously would save money, but more importantly how are you thinking about the expansion of Next? Is this sort of a reevaluation of your cost base? Or is it more sort of a continuation of your usual productivity actions? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. So thank you Shannon for this question. When first and foremost you may recall when I joined HPE 14 months ago, I use the expression that SAM in 2018 that looking at our cost structure was akin to a fitness exercise. And it's always important that we look at our cost structure based on the revenue profile that we have and it's no different right now. Specifically to HPE Next, we are continuing the implementation of the program in that context where we have to align our cost structure to the new business climate that exists. We're not announcing a new restructuring plan. And what is happening is that through the implementation of the new segmentation, we have identified new savings opportunities in each of the businesses and we'll continue to streamline our operations in that context. Antonio Neri : I would say Shannon a couple of things. So I think that what we have done in the last two years give us insights on how we can streamline our operations and be even more agile in focus on everything we do. And as you recall, the HPE Next was really transformative from the process standpoint as well as from the IT perspective. And I will say for the vast majority of everything was executed flawlessly and we have delivered the results with a gross margin expansion you see. As we implemented this new segmentation, now we can see through even better visibility on what else we can go and do. And as Tarek just said it right, the reality is you never stop focusing on improving your operations and because the HPE Next actually at the quarter was a cultural transformation, it give us the ability now to take further actions, which are actually I will argue timely considering the uncertainty we live in, but it's to do the hard things now as these things recovered to come on the other end even stronger than before. On the short-term actions, I think first we have to protect our employees. First and foremost, I think, it\u2019s important. And that was the first step. And then obviously that comes with the benefits and the savings, but I want to be clear, this is all about protecting our employees to make sure they don't get exposed for things they don't need to. Shannon Cross : Thank you. And then can you talk a little bit about what you've seen just in the last couple of weeks in terms of production capability or capacity and things coming online. I'm just curious because some of the other companies in the space have started to mention that they're seeing some improvement in the supply chain. Again, this is more on the China side, but just in terms of availability of components in that and when we talk to is even indicated that almost on a daily basis things were getting better. So I'm just curious as if you can talk at all about near-term trends. Antonio Neri : Yes, no, that's correct. We see kind of the same thing. Obviously, some company has been aligned for some time and they have been recovering on a daily basis, the output of their facilities or their capacity. Obviously, the biggest constraint they had at the time was labor because obviously depending on the region within China, but eventually it became the entire China for the most part is the health measures and certifications that they have to go through. But in general, I will say, it progressed every single day and whether it is people coming online or people improving the output or what we\u2019re already doing. And so that's progressing. And so you have to take it day by day. And obviously, what we're doing is, because we have a global supply chain here is \u2013 China is one aspect, but also how we manage inventory and how we manage the distribution of those orders in a way we can maximize the return while these things gets back to normal. That's how we are managing it. And to be honest, we have a very stringent process with war rooms and talking to suppliers every single day. I personally have talked to at least 50 of them, myself and I have direct contact with each of them. Andrew Simanek : Great, thank you. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thank you, Shannon. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Your free cash flow guidance came down but EPS did not. I was wondering, are you still expecting the same operating profit dollars? Or are there other items, some benefits below the line that that are contemplated within your guidance and have a follow up? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, thank you, Wamsi. So you remember last year, this time of the year, we did say that from a free cash flow standpoint, working capital would be a contributor to cash. And that is what happened last year. This year, we have attained the point where our cash conversion cycle is negative. And whilst we do deliver the EPS guide and we confirmed it per Antonio, the drop in revenue will inevitably have a drag on the free cash flow generation. That is because we have a negative free cash flow cycle. So the way cash tracks earnings is a combination of what happens in the P&L at EPS level, but also the working capital components that comes with a P&L and the revenue from the accounts receivable side and also the fact that we need to build inventory to be able to cater for the supply chain shortages that we explained. That is what is behind the difference between the P&L EPS performance and the free cash flow guide that we put forward. Antonio Neri : And I will say in 2020 obviously it's a timing issue as we recover the supply chain and that is a timing from the \u2013 when we can build and ship these products obviously and also the fact that we have to rebuild some of the inventory because as the operations in China and other parts of the world maybe were impacted. We had to manage that inventory and now we have to build it back over time. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you. Antonio, you commented on sort of the uncertainty surrounding 2Q, but you're also seen to be confident on the fiscal year guide. I understand HPE Next is under your control. But what gives you confidence that this demand comes back? It's clear that things in China are improving, but when you sort of think about the demand environment globally, what gives you confidence that the demand is going to come back in the second half because that's what it seems implicitly what is embedded in your full year guide? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes, I mean, first, let's start with some of the businesses I have reported earlier and Tarek provided detail. Obviously, the Intelligent Edge, we see continued momentum. That is continuing right now as we speak. We feel pretty good about that. Much of the supply chain is not gated in China for the Intelligent Edge, so that's a positive news. Then obviously on high performance computing, the demand continues to be solid. And we have a very interesting pipeline ahead of us with a unique differentiated portfolio. So the need for processing data through AI, machine learning, big data intensive loads continue to be very high. That's not stopping. As we think about these new storage platforms, particularly what I call intelligent data platform, the data growth requires that that data gets stored and gets managed and ultimately insights are extracted from it, so that's positive as well. Right now, as I said earlier, as we went through Q2, we enter with a sizable backlog because we couldn't ship it, in Q1 everything we wanted. And at the same time, we haven't seen yet outside China a significant impact, but obviously as we think about the second back of the year here, obviously we expect to things to return to a level of normalcy that eventually will allows us to continue to progress against that. That's how I see it right now. And because of everything we do both from a mix perspective with the pivot obviously as-a-service, which is a long-term opportunity and growing and the fact we're taking our own actions here with HPE Next and other ones. And that's why at this point in time, we felt comfortable in affirming the original guidance that we provided here on EPS. So we felt prudent to adjust the cash flow for the dynamics Tarek explained earlier. Wamsi Mohan : Perfect. Okay. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thank you, Wamsi. I think we have time for one last question please. Operator : Our final question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I've got two. One is probably really simple, so I'll ask that one first and then the follow-up. What are your expectations for the full year's net CapEx? If you could answer that and then I've got a follow up. Tarek Robbiati : Look, net CapEx for this year is not a particularly large number. In this first half of the year, we have benefited from in plan sales that have reduced our overall CapEx consumption. And we think that from a CapEx standpoint we\u2019re in line with prior years. I don't see beyond the first quarter performance, a significant uptick in CapEx this year. Antonio Neri : We don't have any specific CapEx expenditures that they are extraordinary from what we had seen before. Simon Leopold : Okay. And then the other one I wanted to see if you could give us some better insight is to understand how much money you would be able to borrow say for acquisitions or other purposes yet still maintain your investment grade credit rating. I believe that's important to you. So just I want to get a better understanding of what the sort of maximum borrowing could be. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Well, it really depends on what you borrow the money for to some extent, right. And that's a question. But if you really want to look at how do we maintain our investment grade rating and what would be our borrowing capacity maintaining than the investment grade rating, it's probably around the $5 billion mark. Antonio Neri : But I want to make sure that one thing is clear, right. We are committed to maintain our credit rating. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Simon. I think with that we can close down the call. Antonio Neri : All right, thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thank you everyone for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

Antonio Neri : Thanks, Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is safe and healthy. [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Pardon me. Ladies and gentlemen, we seem to be experiencing some technical difficulties. Antonio, your line may be on mute. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thank you. Sorry. I had the problem with my phone. So, thanks Sonalee. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. And I hope everyone is safe and healthy. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating during the coronavirus-19 crisis. This pandemic is unlike any other crisis we faced. And it has brought significant economic disruption. Businesses and communities are struggling, supply chain productivity continues to be significantly constrained, and the demand environment is uneven. The market for capabilities like remote connectivity and virtual desktop solutions is stronger than pre-crisis in certain segments, and we are well-positioned in those areas. But overall, customers are understandably cautious, given so much uncertainty. These dynamics had a significant impact on our financial performance this quarter, given economic lockdowns since February. Our overall Q2 revenue declined by 15% to $6 billion, which led to a 42% decline in our non-GAAP operating profit. This was a tough quarter by every measure, and I'm of course disappointed in the results. But, I do not view our Q2 performance as a reflection of our capabilities nor of the opportunity ahead of us. Through this unsettling time, I have been really proud of our response that is aligned to our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We consider it our responsibility to help the world navigate this pandemic. We have prioritized protecting the health and safety of our team members and supporting our customers and partners as we weather the storm together. At the outset, we moved quickly to mobilize crisis management teams around the world. We took decisive steps to ensure our team members\u2019 safety and wellbeing. We closed all of our sites and rapidly moved team members to work-from-home except for those are performing mission critical roles. We expanded team members\u2019 benefits to cover coronavirus-19 testing and treatment, enhanced mental health support, and provided tools and resources to keep people connected and productive. We also responded with important initiatives to address key needs created by the pandemic. We made substantial donations through HPE's foundation and designated $2 billion in financing through HPE Financial Services to help customers and partners with financial hardships. Our Aruba networking capabilities have been deployed in drive-up and virtual healthcare clinics and in schools that are facilitating distance learning. And our High Performance Computing solutions are helping scientists and leading research institutions to speed up drug discovery with complex modeling, simulation, AI and machine learning capabilities. We joined forces with the U.S. government and other high tech companies to form the White House High Performance Computing Consortium, giving coronavirus-19 researchers access to HPC resources. HPE also signed the Open COVID Pledge, granting free access to all of our patented technologies for the purpose of diagnosing, preventing and treating the virus. We have also adapted to deliver much needed capabilities and experiences to aid our customers\u2019 transformations as they navigate this difficult time. Through an improved sales coverage model aligned to market segments, our Intelligent Edge business continued to outperform the market while expanding operating margins and demonstrated 12% year-over-year growth in North America. In addition, we gained traction in our HPE GreenLake business. We continued to see acceleration in this very profitable strategic business and are seeing large deals come in, underscoring a growing interest in our as-a-service offerings. In fact, our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 17% to $520 million. While these are healthy signs of the needs that customers will continue to have coming out of the crisis, there continue to be significant supply constraints and delays in customer acceptance. This has impacted our ability to make deliveries to our customers. Across our portfolio, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in backlog in Compute, Storage, HPC and mission critical systems, as well as Aruba which represents two times the historical backlog. Our team is doing everything we can to deliver on these customer orders. Tarek will take you through our Q2 results in more detail. But before he does that, I want to take the time to align actions we will take to address the near term uncertainty and ensure HPE is well-positioned to emerge stronger, more agile and digitally enabled for a post-coronavirus-19 world. While the world is starting to envision what the recovery might look like, we need to be prepared for different scenarios. We know there is not going back to what used to be, there is only preparing for and building what comes next. We need to adapt in order to keep our strategic momentum even as the world has changed dramatically. We have taken a deliberate set of actions to protect our financial foundation, become a more agile organization and align our sources to critical core businesses in areas of growth that accelerate our edge-to-cloud platform-as-a-service strategy. We continue to analyze financial forecasts and customer trends to better understand when and how global economies will recover. In the meantime, we have taken some immediate steps to reduce operating expenses that will protect our financial profile. Effective July 1st, we will implement a short-term pay reduction for all team members where it is legally permitted through October 31, 2020. My executive team and I will take the highest percentage of reduction. Beyond us, the amount of reduction will vary by level. For team members who live in countries where pay productions cannot be mandatory due to local laws and regulations, we are implementing unpaid leaves. In addition we have implemented cost containment measures across the Company, restricted external hirings through the end of our fiscal year and put salary increases on hold. Additionally, our Board of Directors have voluntary decided to forgo a percentage of its cash compensation for the remainder of the fiscal year 2020 to demonstrate its commitment to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, as we focus on preserving liquidity and improve our position to deliver for our customers now and in the future. In addition to those short-term measures, today we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan. This plan will help us focus our investments and realign our workforce to areas of growth that will accelerate our strategy. Some of the measures in the plan include continue to streamline our product portfolio, implement new digital customer engagement models and optimizing a workplace site strategy and experiences. HPE expects the plan would be implemented through fiscal year of 2022. And as a result of the changes to the Company's workforce, real estate model and for the business process improvements, we estimate gross savings of at least $1 billion and annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year 22 year end. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, HPE estimates cash funding payments between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next three years. Tarek will provide further details in his remarks. While we take the steps to secure our financial foundation and strengthen our operations, we have simplified our operating model and have aligned them to the financial segmentation we introduced early this year. Each of the HPE\u2019s businesses is critical to our go forward success. Each carries us an important part of the mission. And as our customers demand in new and different products and services from us, we must deliver. I\u2019m personally committed to delivering to help each of our businesses leverage its existing strengths and evolve. Each of our business groups now report directly to me. As part of the new organizational model, we created a GreenLake Cloud Services group to accelerate our other service capabilities. We also added a new software team that will architect our software strategy and portfolio that power our as-a-service platform. This new structure will provide fuller accountability and improve our execution and transformation. As the world emerges from the global pandemic, business continuity will depend on solutions that advance IT resiliency, empower remote workforces securely, extend connectivity, reinvigorate customer engagement and enable business model evolution. These realities mean that the digital transformation will be more critical than ever. This is why we must accelerate our strategy to deliver everything as-a-service edge to cloud. We see data growth in the cloud, on and off premises, and increasingly at the edge where we are uniquely positioned. The edge customers need persistent connectivity to bridge the digital and physical worlds. HPE Aruba Central is at the core of our edge strategy. It is the only cloud native simple to use and secure platform that unifies network management for wire, wireless and WAN networks, and soon 5G and Edge computing. In Q2, the number of unique customers using Aruba Central increased to 65,000. Customers will also continue to need capabilities to harness the power of their data, wherever it lives, at the edge, across public and private clouds, in colocations, or in the traditional data center. We continue to believe the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And as-a-service business models will expand the cloud experience everywhere for all apps and data. Early this month, we announced the general availability of HPE GreenLake Central, our advanced cloud native platform that provides customers with a consistent cloud experience for all their applications and data through an online operations console that runs, manages and optimizes their entire hybrid cloud to estate. And in Q2, we made HPE container platform generally available, our new cloud native software defined stack is built using technologies from HPE\u2019s acquisition of BlueData, Storage in MapR and deliver greater flexibility and lower cost for Kubernetes deployment of cloud native and non-cloud native applications with persistent Storage connectivity. Next month, at our first ever Discover Virtual Experience, we will showcase how HPE will help organizations ensure seamless business continuity through new technology capabilities, greater business intelligence, and enhanced financial flexibility, joined by thousands of customers and partners who will discuss how we should think differently about transformation in the future, and will introduce new innovation to bring agility to customers\u2019 apps and data everywhere. There is a great promise in what we can accomplish when we increase the speed of innovation and continue to bring to market differentiated capabilities from edge-to-cloud. Our customers, partners and communities need what HPE can provide. Our ability to execute our strategic pivot to offering our entire portfolio as-a-service by 2022, while we continue to re-architect and strengthen our core businesses is critical. As we drive increased performance in our core businesses, we will be able to further align resources to new growth segments that will accelerate our strategy and pave the way to sustainable, profitable growth. One of our core beliefs at HPE is the power of Yes We Can. And I'm confident in our ability to execute because I believe we have the right strategy, the right leadership team and the right mindset to adapt and deliver in bold new ways. We are focused and we are making the necessary tradeoffs, so we can continue to invest in the future. We are undertaking it with a sense of urgency and conviction in our strategy. With that, let me turn into Tarek to review the quarter\u2019s results. Tarek? Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. Hope you can all hear me and are all safe and well. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. As I've done before, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, please note since last quarter, we're now reporting results according to our new segmentation. Antonio discussed some of the key highlights of this quarter on slide one. Now, let me discuss our financial performance, starting slide two. Our Q2 results were heavily impacted by the global COVID-19 crisis. As Antonia mentioned, our Q2 represented a full quarter of operating under COVID-19. Our revenues of $6 billion were down 15% year-over-year, primarily driven by supply chain disruption, which resulted in significantly higher levels of backlog, particularly in Compute, HPC MCS and Storage. We also saw uneven demand with customers pushing out business activity as they navigated through the current economic crisis and lockdown. At the edge, the market for capabilities like remote cloud connectivity, and virtual desktop solutions was stronger than pre-crisis in certain segments. And we're well-positioned in those areas, offsetting the decline in campus switching that resulted from lower business activity. Despite the challenging backdrop, we managed to maintain relatively stable non-GAAP gross margins, which were down by 20 basis points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating profit however was down 42% year-over-year to 6.1% in operating margin terms, and then our non-GAAP EPS of $0.22 was down 48% year-over-year. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.64, primarily due to $865 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with legacy goodwill allocated to the HPC and MCS business segment, which impacted GAAP net EPS by $0.67. This impairment was not driven by the Cray business, which continues to perform consistent with our expectations. Cash flow from operations this quarter was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability and inventory build-up. Free cash flow was negative $402 million compared to a positive $402 million for the prior year period, which was impacted by higher financing volumes. Taking all the previous into account, we're taking decisive and prudent actions to manage our costs and expenses, further improve our liquidity, and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger in the post-COVID-19 world. Turning to slide 3. Antonio outlined for you some of the near-term cost takeout measures we're implementing, including reductions in pay across our workforce, unpaid leave in places where pay reductions are not legally permitted, and hiring restrictions. He also mentioned the actions we\u2019re coming to today to further strengthen our financial profile in the medium and long term and accelerate our strategy. Today, we are announcing a cost optimization and prioritization plan to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company, ready to address the needs of our customers in a post-COVID-19 world. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. More specifically, our plan is designed to right size our cost structure to the new normal, to allocate resources in alignment with our new segmentation and growth areas, to drive increased efficiencies through investments in digitization and automation, and finally, to accelerate our pivot to as-a-service to drive long-term sustainable, profitable growth. Overall, these new cost efficiencies will be captured from simplifying and evolving our product portfolio strategy and go-to-market, cost saving from supply chain optimization, increased penetration of remote customer support, new initiatives to leverage digital marketing and consolidating our real estate footprint. In terms of the timeline, we expect that the plan will be implemented through fiscal year 2022 and estimate that it will deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by fiscal year \u201822 end. Having said that, we expect to achieve the majority of the savings by the end of fiscal year \u201821. In order to achieve this level of cost savings, we estimate cumulative cash funding payments of between $1 billion to $1.3 billion over the next three years. We'll now move to slide 4 that shows our performance in the quarter in accordance with our new segmentation. Let me hit a few key points. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we declined 2%. However, we saw over 12% year-over-year growth in North America, showing that the changes we made to our North America sales leadership and go-to-market segmentation are paying off, even in the midst of a challenging business environment while campus switching declined single digits due to increased emphasis on working from home, we grew the wireless LAN product business 7% year-over-year due to high demand for our remote access solutions and Wi-Fi 6 certified access points with 35% year-over-year growth in North America. Furthermore, we expanded gross margins and also grew operating margins by 570 basis points year-over-year to 11%. The bottom line is that we gained share in both campus switching and wireless LAN markets while significantly improving profit margins. In Compute, revenue declined 19% this quarter, driven by lower conversion rates, even as order backlog grew to 2 times our average historical backlog and lower unit growth, which was negative double digits this quarter. Our ability to fulfill orders was impacted by component shortages with supply chain logistics further disrupting our ability to fulfill demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the supply chain constraints alleviate, we expect to execute against our high backlog. In high-performance Compute and mission critical systems, revenue declined 18% primarily as a result of delayed installation and customer acceptance on account of COVID 19. Similar to Compute, this resulted in an elevated backlog, but we expect to see a stronger uptick in revenues in the second half of the year, as we execute against the order book. Our HPC business has been actively involved in COVID-related research activity and is providing COVID-19 researchers worldwide with access to the world's most powerful HPC resources to advance the pace of scientific discovery in the fight to stop the virus. Furthermore, we announced the 2023 delivery of the world's fastest exascale supercomputer, El Capitan for the United States Department of Energy at a record breaking speed of 2 exaflops, 10 times faster than today's most powerful supercomputer. Most importantly, the Cray integration remains on track to deliver the FY20 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by fiscal year \u201821. Within Storage, we declined 16% year-over-year due to higher backlog, similar to Compute, but had notable strength in big data, showing a growth of 61% year-over-year. Nimble Services revenues grew 20% year-over-year with services intensity at record highs as customers add high-margin value-added services. For operational services which is included across Compute, HPC, MCS and Storage, revenue declined by less than 1% year-over-year while orders were down 5% year-over-year, driven by the drop in Compute units. On the positive side, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold, continued to be strong with double-digit growth in Storage and HPC, MCS services driven by Cray. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continues to be robust. In advisory and professional services, revenue was down 8%, but we significantly improved operating margins by 6.2 points year-over-year due to our reentry in select countries combined with an increase in remote delivery of projects from 65% to 90%, which helped to control costs and drive an improvement in chargeability levels of staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume grew 10% year-over-year, despite the impact of COVID-19 and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter with longer contract terms supporting GreenLake. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 15% again, this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 0.5%, which is best in class in this industry. We will obviously continue to closely monitor the impairment losses as liquidity constraints could affect some of our customers\u2019 ability to pay in upcoming quarters. We will tighten our underwriting guidelines as necessary to ensure we can manage through this crisis, and any impairment losses remain within our level of comfort. Our Communications & Media Solutions business that is included in our corporate investments segment is a strategically important business to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. CMS is showing improved momentum. We saw a strong double-digit softer order growth with EMEA growing 45% and Japan growing 70% this quarter. Revenue gained momentum growing 2% sequentially. We also expanded operating margins by 170 basis points year-over-year this quarter. We also recorded our first 5G core win with a Tier 1 carrier in the United States. This strategic win validates our 5G strategy with multi-vendor integration and true cloud native telco network solutions. Slide five shows our growing ARR profile I introduced at our securities analysts meeting in October 2019. I'm pleased to report that our Q2 \u201820 ARR came in at $520 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and in line with our expectations. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue triple digits year-over-year this quarter. As we progress towards building our go-to-market as-a-service motion and remain focused on offering a full suite of differentiated solutions that can be consumed as-a-service, we are reiterating our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% compounded annual growth rate from FY19 to FY22. Slide six highlights our EPS performance to-date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.22 in Q2 with headwinds from reduced operating leverage, suspension of our share buybacks and lower but expected contribution from OI&E. Consistent with our guidance at SAM, we expect OI&E to be approximately negative $100 million for fiscal year '20.  Turning to gross margin on slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 32% in Q2 of fiscal year '20 which was down 20% -- which was down, excuse me, 20 basis points year-over-year. Commodity costs were a tailwind to gross margin this quarter, even as the supply-demand volumes turned into a more inflationary commodities environment at the start of the quarter. Moving to slide 8. Non-GAAP operating margin was 6.1% in Q2 of fiscal year '20 and non-GAAP operating income was down 42% year-over-year. This clearly demonstrates the imperative to right size our business to reflect the new revenue profile we are facing as a result of the COVID-19 impact. Turning to slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $100 million, impacted by reduced profitability from the Compute and Storage businesses, which were heavily impacted this quarter and higher than normal working capital. Free cash flow was a use of $402 million for the quarter, driven by year-over-year growth which was impacted by financing volumes. Higher than normal backlog and resulting inventory build-up triggered a reduction in our cash conversion cycle from minus 17 days in the prior quarter to minus 5 days this quarter. We expect our cash conversion cycle to improve through the rest of the year as we execute against the backlog and supply chain constraints alleviate, both of which help us reduce our high inventory levels. Now, moving on to slide 10, I want to spend a moment on the strength of our balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, which is a competitive advantage in this environment. As of our April 30th, quarter end, we had approximately $5.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $2.25 billion in senior notes in April 2020 at a low cost of capital. We also have an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal. So, in total, we have approximately $10 million of liquidity. We remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in April 2020. Bottom-line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in our business. Let me recap for you our key takeaways for this quarter on slide 11. But before I do that, it's worth spending a couple of minutes on capital allocation. In Q2, we returned $305 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We repurchased $151 million in shares and paid a cash dividend of $154 million. In April 2020, we took the decision to suspend share buybacks in the light of the current environment where liquidity is of paramount importance. Subsequently, in April, we announced our regular dividend payment for Q3 \u201820, payable in July. Finally, let me summarize the key takeaway for you this quarter. Our fiscal Q2 results represent a full quarter of operating under the COVID-19 crisis and we\u2019re heavily impacted by the crisis, both on the demand and supply side. As a result, we have enacted short-term actions and long-term cost optimization and prioritization plans to reflect the current revenue environment and to position ourselves as a more resilient company in a post-COVID world. Our robust balance sheet with approximately $10 billion of liquidity and investment grade credit rating gives us flexibility not only to weather the current storm, but to continue to invest in key growth initiatives. We remain confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to secure our financial foundation and support our path to sustainable, profitable growth. Now, turning to outlook. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model and running scenarios based on various assumptions, just like everybody else does. Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the crisis and the rate and the shape of the recovery, there's a wide range of possible outcomes for the year. We have taken prudent and decisive steps with the latest being our cost optimization and prioritization plan, so that we are prepared for the different outcomes. Due to the uncertainty and consistent with our April 6, 2020 8-K filing where we withdrew our fiscal year 2020 financial guidance, we will not be providing any Q3 or fiscal year 2020 guidance. Now with that, let me hand over to Antonio and open it up for questions. Antonio? Antonio Neri : So, thank you, Tarek. And I know Nancy is going to operate this. So, Nancy, why we don\u2019t get started? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. The color on backlog is helpful, but I wonder whether you could also give some color on how orders trended through the fiscal second quarter, and what you've seen from an order perspective in the month of May. And then, just related to that, you specifically said that the HPC business and conversion rates would tick up in the second half, but you stopped short of giving a similar timeline for Compute and Storage. So, just any color as to when you think orders will begin to convert in those two segments as well. Antonio Neri : Yes. Hi, Katy. Thanks for the question. So, the order intake or what I referred as the order linearity was fairly steady, I have to say. We normally plan a quarter in 13 weeks. The first week is the previous backlog from the previous quarter -- the backlog from the previous quarter and then 12 weeks. Right? And we plan the linearity early on. And I will say, we hit or exceeded our order linearity intake every week of the quarter. And so, these really came down to our ability to convert the order book into revenue. And in the case of HPC, High Performance Computing, let me remind everyone that in order for us to convert that order into revenue, we have to build it, obviously, we have to ship it, but we have to install it and we have to turn it on. And once the customer accepts that installation, which in many cases is fairly large installations, you're talking about number of clusters, that's when only we can recognize revenue. And so, the impact on HPC was two-fold, was not being able to go to customer sites because customers were locked down like we are and not being able to install and deliver and turn it on. And obviously, the same challenge we have in Compute and Storage with supply chain constraints and capacity because of social distances, and obviously, in the components level that we saw obviously a major disruption. And as a reminder, we ship pretty much three servers every minute. So, when that supply chain stops, it\u2019s pretty significant. So, in terms of going forward, our priority one, two, and three continues to be clear the backlog, and that's how I think about it. Throughout Q2, we made progress in the recovery. I\u2019ll say China is pretty much back to normal, but obviously they are clean in the backlog themselves. Because they had to first recover the labor and then obviously, they depend also on sub-suppliers for the components, think about cables, connectors, transistors, you name it. And so, for us, the majority backlog right now is in the bucket. And then, in the regional factories, for the vast majority, all are performing at capacity except one or two, where, the rules and the regulations or the shelter-in-place are demanding that there is a stringent process on social distancing, which obviously impact the capacity in the factory lines, but the factories are all up and running. So, I am optimistic about the weeks to come. So, I take this a week at a time. Obviously, we continue to focus on the order intake, I cannot comment in May because we think you asked the question on May, because we're in Q3 right now. But in Q2, the order linearity was fairly steady. And we expect, not just HPC but Compute and Storage to continue to make progress. And that's why Q3 will be different than Q2. Operator : Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Antonio, you commented on rightsizing the cost structure to a new normal. A few years ago, HPE Next was supposed to be the last restructuring program. And I know no one could have anticipated COVID-19. But, is it your view that you will not get back to pre-COVID levels because of secular end-market challenges, or is there a different interpretation to that? Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. Great question. So, since you mentioned HPE Next, let me start with that. I mean, I was the architect of HPE Next in the 2017 year. As you know, we launched it in the fall of 2017. And I will say HPE Next was a great success story, because it allowed us to re-architect the Company in the key areas in terms of simplification of processes, streamlining our go-to-market model. Remember, we went from a worldwide geo to country to more a geo model, where we removed layers. And honestly, it allowed us to reinvest back in innovation. And that's where I announced the investment of $4 billion at the edge. And now, we start seeing the results of that, with great numbers, despite the challenges. So, that was a success. And remember, we committed to deliver a $800 million in net savings and which we did and we did ahead of schedule. Now, to your point, this is a crisis unlike anyone we have faced. And I will say, in 2017, I said, listen, we don't envision another cost optimization plan, but this is a cost optimization driven by the pandemic. But honestly, I see an opportunity to go faster in our pivot to our strategy, which is to offer everything as-a-service. It is very unfortunate that we have this pandemic just causing tremendous economic disruption and obviously a huge impact to communities. But, from a business perspective, we are more [convinced] [ph] than ever in our strategy. And we see it. The demand for pervasive ubiquity connectivity. That's why access points are very strong for us. All cloud -- the cloud experience deployed everywhere from the edge to cloud and the ability to consumer as-a-service. And this is where we see tremendous momentum with HPE GreenLake. So, for me, it\u2019s right size our cost structure to the new normal. And we don't know exactly what the new normal is at this point in time, because we don't know what recovery looks like. It's about allocating resources for the areas of growth we see in the future and also increase efficiency because we learn a lot. Remember, in Q1, I talked about it. We learned quite a lot and we extended the HPE Next, which is now part of this cost optimization and prioritization plan, and digitize everything. I believe this will cause incredible structural impact in a way people are going to work. And my expectation is at least 50% of our employees will never come back to an office. And the office will look completely different, which means our offices will be more center of innovation and collaboration, not where you come to do your regular work every day. And that requires resizing our real estate footprint. But even, as you resize the footprint, also requires new experiences and therefore investment associated with that. But, when you bring it all together and the need to rescale and upscale and allocate resources in the right place, I believe we have an opportunity to accelerate the strategy and drive to that long-term sustainable, profitable growth. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, Antonio. And the negative operating leverage on Compute was quite significant in the quarter. How much of that would you say was a supply-driven issue versus demand-driven issue? And how do you think investors should think about the trajectory of that, given that you also have the significant cost actions starting to kick in? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. It definitely was a supply chain-driven, although demand continued to be uneven, as we discussed before, particularly in Compute. And I will say -- you have to look at it this way. The shortfall on the revenue is pretty much all supply chain-driven. Because I made the comment early on that our linearity in the order intake was pretty steady. But, in the order linearity, you have to look at the customer segments. Obviously, when you sell to, I call it cloud companies, which are more software companies that deliver their value through the cloud, those are continuing to be steady. If you think about enterprise, I will say those were pretty steady. SMB obviously was the biggest challenge in the transactional business. Because fundamentally, that segment of the market was significantly disruptive. As I think about the future, right, obviously, we already were under a macro situation. But, let's remind ourselves that the Compute platform go through an innovation cycle themselves, even though it's commoditized. And as I think about the Gen10, if you remember the Gen10, we actually told everyone that we said that two thirds of the structural change was permanent because of the ability to attach richer configuration. As we go to what we call Gen10.5 and Gen11, which is happening in the next 18 months, you're going to see more in that. You're going to see, again the same cycle where the density of these products, the amount of memory and storage, you can put inside this Compute platform will continue to increase. And that's good for us because obviously it drives AUP. But right now, our focus is really around, clear the backlog, both on the Compute side and on the HPC side, both finish installation and obviously clear the backlog there as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni Sacconaghi : I have two questions as well. First, it sounds like you're saying there was really a de minimis impact from coronavirus on demand and this was largely supply chain driven. And if you have the supply and you kept backlog at normal levels, you would have done $700 million more in revenue in Q2. And it sounds like if production is up and running, if you are able to bring down your backlog to normal levels, such should boost Q3 revenues $700 million relative to normal seasonality. So, am I thinking about that correctly? And how much progress do you think you can make on bringing your backlog down to normal levels over the course of Q3? And then, I have a follow-up. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Toni. Hope all is well. Yes. I think, you're thinking in the right parameters. The only thing I will say is that definitely the vast majority was supply chain. And as I said in my early comment in the previous question, there was some demand obviously, but particularly in SMB and some elements of the mid market where enterprise was a little more steady. And we saw uptick in demand for example, that consumes Compute for example solutions like VDI, which was in high demand or even big data storage, which at the end, Toni is a Compute platform with a level of hard disk attached to it or SSDs attached to it. So, in that context, you are asking absolutely the right question, and this is what I\u2019m maniacally focused with the team and which as I said, my priority one, two and three is clear the backlog. And as I said earlier, we focus the quarter in 13 weeks, where we enter the backlog, which was the $1.5 billion on May 1st and where we're going to exit on July 31st as the new orders come in. Because fundamentally, we expect the orders to come in. And we have an linearity plan associated with that recovery. So, I feel pretty optimistic about it. But however, it's going to come down to our ability to get the supply in the right place and the ability to execute in the cycle times that we need. And obviously, as you know, we have a very global diversified supply chain, and we have made some series of moves to move products built around the globe, even if they are for other regions. So, we can accelerate that backlog. And so, this is going to be the name of the game. But generally, as I think about the last four weeks, and I think about the next four weeks and then the next four weeks after that, we continue to see progress. But, there's a lot of things, who knows, there is a restart of coronavirus. I'm more concerned right now, Toni, to be honest with you, if something happened in one of these locations where we have the factory and you go into resheltering of the social distancing, that could have an impact. In terms of the velocity behind with components from China, I will say that\u2019s where the vast majority is going absolutely in the right direction. And obviously, the logistics side, as we reopen countries and flights across the globe, that will help as well. Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. Thank you for that. Maybe you could -- I mean, is it unrealistic to think you could close, you could get backlog to normal levels? And then, my second question is, if you're really saying that this was largely the supply, not demand disruption, I'm still a little -- I'm having difficulty reconciling the new -- sort of HPE Next too, because on your Q4 call, you were pretty unequivocal there wouldn't be another HPE Next. You felt you were in the right place on cost. You said last quarter, you were doing a little bit more on cost, but it wasn't structural, it wasn\u2019t another HPE Next. And now, you are undertaking a significant multiyear structural change. And A, that doesn't feel consistent with the statement that this was really a supply issue; and B, it makes me wonder like, are you more worried about your competitive position, or are you worried that the IT environment is going to be weaker for a while? Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Toni. So, my remarks about what happened in Q2 was about the supply chain and lesser so on the demand. I cannot forecast right now what the demand is on the back end. And this is where in our remarks we said we are looking at the pipeline, we're looking at the economic indicators, which obviously all of you provide, and others. And so, I will not make any further comment because on the demand in -- I don\u2019t know in October or November, I don't know what that will look like. But, I'm just replying to your question about what happened in Q2 definitely was based on the order intake we had. It was -- the vast majority was the supply chain problem. And there were pockets of uneven demand, which obviously were accentuated in SMB space, which was quite significant. But remember, we serve global customers, we serve large enterprise, mid-market and SMB, and in that a lower vertical. So, we have to look at this from multiple perspectives. But definitely in Q2 was -- the vast majority was a definitely a supply chain, and in that demand, we saw pockets of growth, despite the dynamic of the coronavirus, which Aruba definitely was -- despite the 2% decline year-over-year, we saw bright spots in wireless LAN up 7%, North America, the geo 12%, the remote access points we couldn't ship enough of it. I mean, we didn't have all of it. VDI was another one. So, I think that was Q2. As I think about Q3, it\u2019s all about cleaning the backlog. And in a reasonable way, I feel more confident in Q3 and obviously in the results in Q2 because we should expect continuous improvement. As for the demand, I don't know what to tell you, Toni right now, because obviously it depends also in the global recovery of the economy. And then, ultimately, customers are going to assess where they want to spend their money, but right now, that's where we are. And then, in terms of HPE Next, I made that comment at the beginning of HPE Next. Now, let's be clear. I mean, nobody expected the coronavirus 19. But as I said in one of my comments, I think to Katy's question -- actually, Wamsi\u2019s question was, I believe this is -- in a downturn, this is where you go double down your strategy. And this is where investing in the right place now. So, when the recovery takes place, you come out on the other end stronger. And so, that's fundamentally what we're doing is really obviously addressing the cost resizing for the situation we are in. And in the short term, we have taken some painful action. For me, as a CEO, telling our employees we're going to cut salaries, not an easy thing to do. I don't take that lightly. But in the other end, allocating the right people, the right resources, the right investment into the future, now that we're in the downturn is the biggest opportunity. Because I think the strategy is absolutely spot on. And I'm more convicted than ever. Thanks, Toni. Okay. Operator, next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my questions. My first one is, I realize you're not giving guidance, but can you provide some parameters for us to consider thinking about OpEx, how much is variable, how material do you think the salary reductions will be relative to sort of the overall base run-rate of OpEx? And, is there a significant amount of revenue that\u2019s sort of just sitting out there waiting to be recognized as soon as customers come back and can be trained and can accept? And I don't know maybe something about backlog in terms of your confidence level that you're not going to lose those orders to competitors or that they are pretty firm orders? Just anything you can kind of give us to have some idea of how to think about it? Was this the trough quarter for instance? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. Let me start, and then, I will ask Tarek talk about more the first part of your question. Obviously, again, it goes back to Toni's question, the confidence to clear the backlog. And this is where again we are focusing. I feel better about it than six weeks ago. But, as I said earlier, right, we're taking it day by day, week by week. It looks promising. And we continue to make progress every day, every week. In terms of what is the size of revenue? I cannot give you a right now, but I will tell you, remember, HPC deals are normally multimillion dollar deals, sometimes mid-double-digit deals. And those are all waiting to be deployed and installed. And they are all over the world. And so, obviously, we have a fantastic services organization ready to go as soon as the customer let us in. So, those are the things you need to think about it. But, I hope everybody appreciates, we\u2019ve given you complete direction of what was the backlog and what we are doing about it.  I think, I'm going to give it back to Tarek to talk about the first part of the question. So, Tarek? Tarek Robbiati : Thank you, Antonio. It's quite difficult to call the bottom or trough quarter, given the level of uncertainty that is currently visible. There's one thing that we know is that the uncertainty is high. And it's everyone's guess what the shape of the recovery will be. So, please bear that in mind. And most people and economists we talk to and spend a lot of time talking to many experts, as I'm sure you did, are not thinking in terms of a V-shape recovery, more in terms of a U-shape recovery. And that's what we are modeling. And this is why we have come up with the cost prioritization plan that Antonio mentioned. And as he said, we need to take every day as it comes. So, in terms of cost take out, there is -- as part of our plan, the goal is to achieve the vast majority of the $800 million net run rate savings by fiscal year \u201821, although we said this number will be visible by fiscal year \u201822. And the reason why we said this is because of this level of uncertainty that exists in the shape of the economic recovery that I was referring to you before. So what we are doing is we\u2019re supplementing run rate reductions with temporary pay cuts and actions that we can take otherwise to protect the financial profile of the company and enhance our liquidity moving forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeriel Ong from Deutsche Bank. Jeriel Ong : Thanks for letting me ask a question. And, I guess, first of all, I\u2019d like to ask a little about GreenLake. Obviously, it was nice that the business still grew, year-on-year. But I'm wondering why you\u2019re confident in an acceleration in that growth. It seems like as the business gets bigger, it'd be hard seeing growth rate, but it seems like you're kind of back ending more of that growth to get to that 30% to 40% compound annual growth rate. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thank you, Jeriel. I think, we have a unique differentiated value proposition with the HPE GreenLake. And with the introduction of the HPE GreenLake Central, which is a true cloud native platform where you can deploy the right mix from edge to cloud and consumer as-a-service and deliver the workload optimized solutions in a standardized way, it is a true differentiation for us. And what we have seen in the last several months is a continuous growth in a pipeline and the ability to convert the pipeline into larger deals, larger deals. Some of these deal, in particular two or three, which are triple digits, to give a sense. And so, for us -- and also, they are multiyear, right? So, for us, that's an exciting, because remember, we said many times, when we sign a GreenLake deal, we work with a customer in a multiyear deal. And the pull-through for infrastructure that goes with it and services attached is higher. The services attached through Pointnext operational service is 100% by the way, attach. And the margins are higher. So, fundamentally, we are confident in reaffirming the annualized run rate revenue of 30% to 40% that Tarek talked earlier, because it's a function of getting these continuous momentum and larger deals for many large cap companies. So, I think that's what we feel. And now, we are tailored more for the mid-market as well for SMB. And what the customers are looking for is the ability to scale up and down based on their needs, and also more and more have someone else run it for them. They don't want to be in the run side, they want to be more in the innovation side. Jeriel Ong : I appreciate that. And just one more for me. I think, I get a sense from the cash spend for the realignment that fiscal year \u201821 is going to be -- seems like the bulk of the spending. But, I guess, I'd like to get an idea for whether it's going to be cost of goods sold or OpEx-driven, if it is going to represent the general mix on your costs generally, or if it's going to be weighted one way or another. Thanks. Antonio Neri : I'm going to give that to Tarek. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Thank you, Antonio. With respect to cash and cash flow and I'd like also to ask you a question for clarification purposes. With respect to cash flow, what has driven our cash flow performance in Q2, is the increase in inventory levels and the change in the cash conversion cycle. We've stocked up a lot of inventory. And the backlog is also a reflection of the fact that we stocked up a lot of inventory. And our cash flow conversion cycle, which was a favorable minus 17 days, dropped to less favorable minus five days because of our stocking up in inventory terms. Could you please, for my benefit, repeat your question on costs and what you were trying to get to here? I did not quite understand it. Thank you. Jeriel Ong : Yes. So, in terms of your annualized net run rate savings, what areas of your business are those going to come from? Tarek Robbiati : Okay. So, by and large, we're going to leave no stone unturned. That's the message. But, effectively, if you look at what the plan is about, it\u2019s fundamentally around realigning resources to the segments that we started to report back in the first quarter and areas of growth that we see driving better productivity levels across those segments, changing fundamentally the way we engage with customers from a marketing and sales standpoint, rethinking our supply chain to create it in such a way that is more resilient than before, yet agile and efficient, rethinking also our workforce management practices. Because quite frankly, I don't know what your situation is like, but we've been working very effectively from home for the past three months almost. And so, this is pointing to us the need to think about this new normal and what does it mean from a workforce management standpoint, and our real estate footprint. So, you can rethink your real estate footprint now that the world is much more distributed and connected than ever before. So, I hope I have provided sufficient color to answer your question. Back to you, Antonio. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Antonio. Next question? I know, we got into the top of the hour where we are 5 minutes over. Do we have any more questions on the line operator? Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Jake Wilhelm : Hi. This is Jake on for Aaron. I was wondering if you could go into a little bit about how we should think about portfolio simplification in regard to the cost optimization plan. Antonio Neri : Yes. So, obviously, from the portfolio optimization, I think about the work we have done under HPE Next and continue that work to streamline number of platforms and options, we have done a phenomenal job there. But to Tarek\u2019s point, it\u2019s all about where we build these products and fundamentally, where we also design these products. So, there is an opportunity to continue to drive that optimization. And fundamentally, I think about our portfolio as a way to accelerate that as-a-service model. Obviously, on one end, at the edge, we have a fantastic cloud platform called HP Aruba that we continue to invest -- Aruba Central, that we continue to invest and it\u2019s this 100% software, right, with access points and switching that comes with it, think that way, and obviously through the subscription model. The other thing is, obviously in the core business is how we drive the best workload optimized solutions that they are fully automated and provision from the cloud using HPE GreenLake Central. So, that's another component of that. So, that's how we think about it. And obviously, there is a lot of the work we do even in the core businesses. While people may think it\u2019s hardware -- and I want to give an example. The recent introduction of a distributed hyperconverged infrastructure is actually all software. It's 100% software in many ways. And as I think about the future, how the world will evolve, we're going to live in a more distributed model. Today, it's very centralized in the sense you have your mobile phone or your mobile device connected to some sort of cloud, that cloud can be your datacenter, can be somebody else's cloud. But fundamentally, the cloud experience will extend -- will be extended all the way to the edge. And that's why we have plan in that portfolio to continue to invest in the Aruba Central with integration of 5G and the integration of edge computers. So, it's a combination of freeing up resources in the traditional businesses, reallocate those resources in those areas that will drive the long-term sustainable, profitable growth, based on the work we have done in HPE Next and also continue to digitize everything we have and we can. Okay. So, next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. My sense is, is that the quarter you just reported was primarily supply and the uncertainty you're expressing about the outlook maybe reflects more of a shift towards demand. So, I thought it would be helpful, if you could give us a better understanding of what your customer verticals typically look like? In other words, how much is federal government, how much is the SMB market, how much is Financial Services? Because I think even if we can\u2019t make predictions, I think all of us have some sense of which verticals are healthier than others. I appreciate it. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thanks, Simon. I think, I will say -- let me start with the bad. SMB obviously has been a significant challenge, we all witness every day. That's what has driven a big chunk of the unemployment that we see here in the United States. So, obviously, that will take time to recover. And generally, that market gets served through what we call a transactional engine, and it\u2019s a high velocity engine. In the enterprise, if you take it by vertical, I think telco has been fairly steady. Tarek talked about a portfolio that we have called Communications & Media Solutions. You heard some of the numbers, in some areas growing 40% and 70%. It's all software and services, and obviously drags infrastructure because eventually has to virtualize, whatever infrastructure put there. Financial Services actually was fairly steady and strong. We have a very large footprint. And this is where the diversification of our geo and verticals actually is helping us a little bit. Generally, FSI and telco are very large for us, where retail not so much, and I think retail obviously was more impacted. But I will say, telco or communications, media and entertainment, Financial Services was strong. Obviously, oil and gas not so much, because we know the pricing of the oil. And then, as I think about transportation, obviously impacted as well. But, I will say the number of deals and the size of the deals were generally the same. The elongated sales cycles were consistent. But we align our plans based on the linearity I talked earlier. And Q2 was fairly steady so far. So, whether the first half was supply chain and the second half is demand is to be seen. Again, Tarek talked early on about the shape of the recovery. And I agree with Tarek, I totally subscribe to the U recovery. The question is how far the two sides of the U are and how deep the U is. But right now, it feels steady in those areas. And as I said earlier, our focus is the backlog. Okay. Next question? I think, this is the last -- one more question. I think, this is the last question. I think we have another question on the line. Operator : Our final question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Irvin Liu : Thanks. Hi. This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. As I look at your cost optimization and prioritization plan that was announced today, that will result in a $1 billion to $1.3 billion total cash payment through fiscal 2022. Now, is it fair to say that the cost savings plan will essentially push back the timing related to the achievement of your normalized free cash flow target of $2 billion by let's say another two to three years? Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm going to pass it to Tarek. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you, Antonio. So, the most important thing in our costs optimization and privatization plan is to achieve those $800 million of net run rate savings and hold them as long as possible in the cost structure, so that we can effectively see more margins in our business. With respect to free flow last year, if it were not for a legal settlement that we paid, we would have exceeded $2 billion free cash flow Mark. So, that was what that business was capable back then with a certain revenue base. And, what you've heard from Antonio is that we are rightsizing the business to what is potentially a new revenue base. And it's too early to tell whether that new revenue base will come back to the pre-pandemic revenue levels, moving forward. But, what's very important right now is our focus is to ensure that we right size our business and deliver those run rate savings, so that we can emerge stronger after this crisis subsides. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Tarek. And again, I just want to -- last year was a unique year in the sense that we were pretty much on track. And actually, I would argue, we delivered the normalized free cash flow because we were able to take care of unique circumstances with the settlement in arbitration. So, when you add it all up, it was in excess of $2 billion. And again, it comes down to our ability to drive the operating cash, the cash from operations which general tends to be very strong. Obviously, this quarter, because we couldn't convert, we couldn't deliver that. But, let me remind again that the cost optimization and prioritization is not just about resizing, but it's about shifting investments to the strategy, which I answered earlier to Toni, I think is the opportunity we have now and therefore, making that happen in the lower part of this, whatever the lower is, is the right strategy, so you become stronger on the other end. So, to wrap it up, thanks again for joining us today and for your questions. Let me make a few comments to wrap the call. As I said earlier, these are unprecedented and challenging times for all of us, not just the business, but obviously the economy and the communities. Technology and digital transformation, in my view, are more critical than ever, to enable what I think is going to be new world, the new distributed world where workforces would be located in different ways. And honestly, there will be new ways to run businesses. I think, our strategy to deliver a cloud experience from the edge to the cloud is more relevant than ever. And at the core of that is to securely connect people and things as we see more than 50 million devices being connected to the network every single day. But, at the same time, we need to analyze data faster and to accelerate the business outcomes for our customers. I think, the measure we announced today will allow us to protect not only our balance sheet and continue to preserve the liquidity, which as you saw, in one of the slides, we have a very robust balance sheet with capacity up to $10 billion. So, that's not the issue. But fundamentally, my goal is to adapt the organization to be more agile, to align our resources to the critical core business areas of growth, and ultimately to accelerate the strategy, which I'm very convicted which will result in a long-term sustainable, profitable growth. And I want you to take away that this work is being done with sense of urgency. Whether we are the first to announce it than other people, doesn't matter, we believe that this is the right thing to do, and the time is important. So, again, thank you for joining us, the call today. And I hope you stay safe with you and your family. And we'll talk soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today and you may now disconnect. Thank you.",

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Sonalee, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Overall, I am pleased with our Q3 performance. We executed well to enable strong sequential growth across our businesses. We gained momentum in key areas of differentiation, driven by customer demand aligned to our strategy, and we began to take decisive and prudent actions to strengthen our core financial foundation, while we continue to align resources to critical areas of growth. COVID-19 has forced fundamental changes in businesses and communities. These changes have further validated our strategy. Navigating through the pandemic and planning for a post-COVID world has increased customer needs for other service offerings, secure connectivity, remote work capabilities and analytics to unlock insights from data. Our solutions are aligned to these needs, and we see a tremendous opportunity to help our customers transform and digitize their businesses as they continue to adapt and operate in our new world. Let me review a few highlights from the quarter. Total net revenue of $6.8 billion was up 14% quarter-over-quarter and non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. Compute, HPC & MCS, Storage, and Intelligent Edge business segments also grew sequentially. Moving forward, we expect continued gradual performance improvement. We made significant improvements in our supply chain execution, reducing our backlog by more than $500 million from our Q2 historical high exit levels, which contributed to our results. In our HPC business, COVID-related impacts continued to affect our customers' ability to accept delivery of our products. We expect to return to normalized level of backlog by the end of Q4 through continued improvements in both supply chain execution and customer acceptances. Our pivot to as-a-service continued its strong momentum in the quarter. Our annualized revenue run rate of $528 million grew 11% year-over-year. GreenLake services orders grew a record 82% year-over-year. We believe this is faster than the orders growth of public cloud vendors and it is a validation of our hyper strategy and competitive differentiation. We are focused on delivering one seamless cloud experience for all applications and data, no matter where they exist; at the edge, in a data center, in a colocation, or in a public cloud estate. While others are public now publicly declaring plans to offer Everything-as-a-Service, we have been focused on this for several years and have made significant organic and inorganic investments to deliver a differentiated experience for our customers. Our Q3 free cash flow of $924 million was up $276 million year-over-year, driven by a record cash flow from operations as a result of our improved execution this quarter. Importantly, we also declared our Q4 dividend today. Dividends remain an important part of our capital allocation framework that consists of capital return to shareholders and strategic investments that together drive long-term shareholder value. Our customers are managing through the pandemic with even greater needs for the capabilities HP can uniquely provide. In June, we put our strategy in the spotlight at our Discover Virtual Experience event, where we introduced new breakthrough innovation on a global virtual stage. The new solutions we introduced support our position that cloud is an experience, not a destination, and they're already gaining traction with our customers. We launched our next-generation of HP GreenLake Cloud Services. These new cloud services span machine learning operations, container management, virtualization, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, data protection and Connectivity-as-a-Service. Now, our customers can access all of our HP GreenLake Cloud services via a soft service point-and-click catalog on our HP GreenLake Central Cloud Portal. Notably, in Q3, we signed several of our largest HPE GreenLake Cloud services deals in history, including LyondellBasell, one of the largest plastics, chemicals, and refining companies in the world who signed a $27 million HP GreenLake deal to drive their digital transformation and environmental efficiency. Underpinning our customers' cloud experience is the need for software. That is why we introduce our new HPE Ezmeral software portfolio. Our new portfolio includes a container platform that deploys Kubernetes at scale for a wide range of use cases on bare-metal and virtual machines. A data fabric that delivers enterprise-wide global access to data from edge-to-cloud with best-in-class reliability, security and performance, and machine learning operations solution that increases speed and agility for machine learning ops by operationalizing end-to-end processes from pilot to production, as well as IT operations and automation to improve productivity and mitigate risk of service disruption. In addition, it enables our customer to control cost and compliance across their hybrid cloud estate through our managed cloud controls capabilities built into the portfolio. HPE Ezmeral can be consumed as a license or as a part of our HPE GreenLake Cloud Services offering. And just a few weeks ago, as a strong endorsement of our strategy and capabilities, we announced plans to partner with SAP to deliver the customer addition of SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with HPE GreenLake Cloud Services. This new joint solution will help customers leverage our cloud capabilities, while keeping their SAP workloads and data on-premises. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our core capabilities in Storage and Compute, which are essential resources to store and process customers' data. Every 60 seconds, we ship 46 terabytes of storage in four servers. Despite the challenging market that impacted our storage performance overall, in Q3, we saw sequential improvement of 4%, and importantly, we gained traction and grew in key areas of investment. Big Data storage, which is built on unique intellectual property from our MapR acquisition to enable real-time analytics for mission critical Big Data overloads, grew revenues 31% year-over-year. Nimble distributed HCI, our new hyper-converged solution for business-critical applications and mixed overloads of scale grew revenue at 112% year-over-year. And a great example of our organic innovation is HP Primera, our most intelligent storage platform, grew revenues 114% year-over-year. HP Primera gained 104 new logos this quarter, with nearly one-quarter of those being new to HP Storage. We saw strong sequential momentum with HPC in mission-critical systems that grew 10%, including a 10-year deal of $125 million with the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, who chose HPE to power the Edinburgh International Data Facility with our industry-leading HPC and AI solutions. And finally, we had a very solid quarter in Compute, with 29% quarter-over-quarter growth, driven by the reduction in backlog and customer demand in VDI, or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure solutions. For example, Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands wanted to upgrade its VDI environment for life cycle management needs and to prepare for future waves of COVID-19. We introduced a complete composable hyper-converged infrastructure solution based on HPE Synergy, along with HPE Primera to meet their needs. Our Intelligent Edge business performed in line with the market in Q3. We continue to see the edge as a significant opportunity over the long-term. The explosion of data devices and application will drive demand for secure multi-protocol connectivity, analytics and cloud computing capabilities at the Edge, especially in the post-COVID world. We are now entering the edge of insights, driven by the amount of data we are generating and the utilization of new analytic tools, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies. Customers are looking to power a new breed of applications and workloads that work in concert with the cloud, but analyze and process data at the edge. To enable these new customer needs, we introduced the Aruba Edge services platform, or Aruba ESP, the industry first AI-powered cloud platform designed for to unify, automate and secure the edge. The Aruba ESP combines AIOps, Aruba Zero Trust security and a unified infrastructure with financial and consumption flexibility. And we are seeing early customer adoption. Noble Hospitality, a luxury lifestyle brand is standardizing on our Aruba Edge services platform as their edge cloud foundation for the hotel chain. The ability to generate actionable analytics where the data is created and deliver new on-property experiences for guests was critical to their decision. We also announced our plans to acquire SD-WAN leader Silver Peak. Silver Peak's advanced SD-WAN offerings strengthened our Aruba ESP and complements Aruba's existing work-from-home and branch office solutions to deliver one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios designed to securely connect any edge to any cloud. The combination, which is expected to close in Q4 of this fiscal year, will allow enterprise customers to simplify their branch office and one deployments to empower remote workforces, enable cloud-native deployments and transform business operations without compromising quality or reliability. These are great example of accelerating our strategy while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Building on our 5G Core Stack launched in March, we introduced a new Telco Edge Orchestrator Solution for telecom operators. This new solution provides revenue opportunities for telecoms in the enterprise market with one-click deployment of applications at the edge of the new 5G networks. We are receiving positive feedback on our 5G offerings. For example, we announced an innovative technical demonstration of an automated virtual 5G network conducted with a French telecom operator, Orange, and telco infrastructure solutions provider Casa systems. The demo highlights the expanding use cases and service agility needed to support 5G business applications, including location-based telemetry, IoT, edge computing and more that will require low latency. Our ability to innovate for our customers is made possible by strong financial management that strengthen our core financial foundation and allows us to align resources to the most critical areas. As we exited Q2, you will recall that we took a number of decisive and prudent actions to manage our business through the evolving impacts of COVID-19. This included several short-term initiatives to reduce operating expenses and drive efficiencies as well as the introduction of a long-term cost optimization and prioritization plan designed to accelerate sustainable profitable growth. We remain on track to deliver the annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022, driven by optimizing our workplace site strategy, simplifying our product portfolio and introducing new digital customer engagement models. These efforts, backed by our diversified portfolio, robust balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating, will allow us to continue to invest in key growth areas. In closing, I am proud of our Q3 performance, and I am proud of our HPE team. Our team members have been steadfast partners for our customers through an unprecedented period. They have moved quickly to address rapidly evolving market conditions. They have innovated with our customers in mind. They have made personal sacrifices to invest in our company's future. They have passionately committed to help HPE play a role in shaping a more equitable and inclusive society. And they have done all of this, while managing the challenges of living through a global pandemic. Put it more simply, my HP colleagues have represented our values, labor culture and deliver on our purpose to advance the way people even work. As a result of the efforts, HP is stronger and better able to serve our customers, partners and communities in a world that's forever changed. While we continue to navigate through the global pandemic and macro uncertainty, we are cautiously optimistic that we will see gradual quarter-over-quarter performance improvement going forward. This is why we are providing guidance for our fiscal year 2020 non-GAAP EPS, which Tarek will discuss. We look forward to seeing you virtually at our security Analyst meeting on October 15, where we will provide more details about our long-term plans. And with that, let me turn it over to Tarek to review the quarter's results. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Also, let me remind you that since the start of the fiscal year, we are reporting results according to our new segmentation. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide four. Now let me discuss our financial performance, starting with slide five. Q3 was characterized by strong execution, driving sequential growth. We delivered Q3 revenues of $6.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and down 4% from the prior year period. I am especially pleased to report that we have made significant progress in clearing our backlog by more than $500 million during the quarter. We expect a return to normalized backlog levels as we exit Q4 2020. As a result, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 8% sequentially to $2.1 billion in Q3. Non-GAAP gross margins were 30.4% this quarter, down 160 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of compute as we executed against our backlog from prior quarters. Normalizing for the effect of backlog, both our compute and storage business segments grew gross margin on a sequential basis. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 33% sequentially, resulting in a 7.1% operating margin, and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.32 was up 45% sequentially. Our GAAP EPS was $0.01 as we accelerated our transformation program and incurred restructuring costs. Q3 cash flow from operations was approximately $1.5 billion, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million, up $276 million from the prior year period, driven primarily by favorable working capital movements that I will detail later. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable October 7, 2020. Let's move to slide six, which shows our performance in the quarter by segment. Here are the highlights. In the Intelligent Edge segment, we grew revenues 3% quarter-over-quarter, in line with the market. While wireless LAN declined single-digits sequentially, we grew the campus switching business 12% quarter-over-quarter. In North America, our largest geo, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating our continued momentum. Operating margin in Q3 was 8.6%, down 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter, impacted primarily by higher logistics and duties costs in this current environment. In Compute, revenue grew 29% quarter-over-quarter as we executed against the backlog and improved our supply chain execution. Not only did units grow strong double-digits sequentially, AUP grew 3% quarter-on-quarter as well. The increased operating leverage in this segment resulted in an operating profit margin of 8.5%, up 380 basis points quarter-over-quarter. In High Performance Compute & Mission Critical Systems, revenue grew 10% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in Edge Compute, HPC Apollo, and MCS, up sequentially 82%, 16%, and 2%, respectively. We expect to see sequential momentum next quarter driven by increased customer acceptance for HPC/MCS and Cray as we execute against the order book across the portfolio. Most importantly, Cray remains on track to deliver both on its FY 2020 revenue targets and triple-digit run rate synergies by the end of fiscal year 2021. Within Storage, we grew revenue 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong operational execution across the segment portfolio of products and reduction of backlog to normalized levels. With respect to Pointnext operational services, which is included across our Compute, HPC/MCS, and Storage segments, total revenue was down 2%, while orders grew 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware unit sold continued to be strong with solid double-digit growth on a sequential basis across all segments; Compute, Storage and HPC/MCS. This demonstrates that the underlying profitability of the units we sell and the attach rates continue to be robust. In Advisory & Professional Services, revenue was down 4% sequentially as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. This business is strategically important for us as it helps customers navigate through their digital transformation and also pull-through significant infrastructure and operational services orders. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 1% quarter-over-quarter despite the impact of COVID-19, and our net portfolio of assets was up 4% this quarter, driven primarily by FX movements. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 74 basis points, which was slightly higher than previous quarters is still best-in-class within this industry. I am particularly pleased by the collection performance in HPEFS, which attests to the quality of the book and the HPEFS franchise overall. I will come back to that later on. Our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investment segment is strategically important to us, providing software and services capabilities to telco service providers. Revenue was down 4% sequentially due to first half slowdown in services bookings. However, due to our improved cost of delivery, we're able to expand operating margins by 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud native telco networks functions. Slide 7 shows our growing ARR profile, which I introduced at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October 2019. I am very pleased to report that our Q3 2020 ARR came in at $528 million, representing 11% year-over-year growth. GreenLake Service orders were up 82% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by outstanding performance in North America, which delivered 5x year-over-year growth. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform continued to grow revenue strong double digits year-over-year as well. Based on strong customer demand, I am confident to reiterate our ARR growth guidance of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2022. Slide 8 highlights our EPS performance to date. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.32 in Q3, up 45% sequentially from Q2 driven by improved operating leverage, cost control and lower OI&E expenses. We now expect fiscal year 2020 OI&E to be significantly less than our $100 million expense guidance provided at SAM 2019, driven by higher earnings from equity interest in HPC, and better cost of debt resulting from our balance sheet funding diversification strategy that I will elaborate further on. Turning to gross margin on slide 9. And as I mentioned previously, non-GAAP gross profit was up 8% sequentially due to improved operating leverage. At 30.4% of revenues, our gross margin was down 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by higher mix of compute as we executed against our elevated backlog from the prior quarter. Most importantly, and normalizing for the effect of backlog, both Compute and Storage business segments grew gross margins on a sequential basis. Moving to slide 10. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.1% in Q3 of fiscal year 2020 and non-GAAP operating income of $484 million was up 33% quarter-over-quarter. A combination of improved operating leverage and disciplined cost controls enabled us to improve profitability on a sequential basis. Last quarter, let me say this, we were prescient by proactively announcing the head of other industry players, a cost optimization and prioritization plan that would deliver annualized net run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022. We are making excellent progress there and are very much on track to emerge stronger in the post-COVID world. The actions we outlined as part of that plan to transform our core by optimizing our cost structure and aligning our resources through deep segmentation to key growth areas are now clearly starting to bear fruit. Turning to Slide 11. We generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.5 billion. This is the highest level for the past 11 quarters, as we improved our operational execution. Free cash flow was $924 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements that resulted in favorability in Q3. Overall, we saw an improvement in our cash conversion cycle for minus five days in the prior quarter to minus 10 days this quarter. For Q4, we expect free cash flow to be sequentially lower, mainly due to two reasons : number one, working capital will be a use of cash; and number two, higher restructuring payments related to our core transformation plan we announced in Q2. As you recall, during the lockdown, we discussed our company exposure by industry vertical and company size, and explain in detail that our business is highly resilient. As a proof point, I would like to highlight the performance of our credit collection teams in both our operating company and in HPEFS. Thanks to their contribution during the quarter, the level of our ARR that is current is at a record high of 99.5%, which attest of the strength of the HPE business and the quality of our franchise. Now moving on to Slide 12, I want to spend a moment to talk about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position and provide some insight on the puts and takes on forthcoming adjustments to our cash and debt positions. As of our 31st of July quarter end, we had approximately $8.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, having successfully raised $1.75 billion in senior notes in July 2020 at a low-cost of debt. Post the quarter end, we redeemed $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $10.3 billion of liquidity after the redemption of the notes maturing in October 2020. Additionally, we expect to pay $925 million cash when we complete the proposed acquisition of Silver Peak, which is expected to close in Q4 of fiscal year 2020. Adjusted for these known changes, our opco gross debt would be lower by $3 billion to approximately $4.4 billion, and our opco cash will also be lower by $3.9 billion to approximately $4 billion, resulting in an opco net debt of approximately $400 million. Separately, we have securitized some Financial Services-related debt through the ABS market in the U.S., and as of July 301st quarter end, we have approximately $2.1 billion in outstanding ABS issuances. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at cheaper cost of capital, which helps diversify our balance sheet and lower interest expense payments in the future. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was reaffirmed by the rating agencies in July 2020. Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on slide 13. Given the progress made in our operations, we are now in a position to provide guidance on fiscal year 2020 EPS. We expect to finish fiscal year 2020 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.34, and we expect our fiscal year 2020 GAAP diluted net loss per share to be between $0.35 and $0.31. Let me recap our key takeaways for this quarter on slide 14. We delivered strong sequential improvement in top and bottom line and significantly improved operational and supply chain execution. We also accelerated our as-a-service pivot with very strong momentum in ARR and record GreenLake Services order growth. We're taking actions to strengthen our financial foundation and align resources to critical areas to transform our core and drive sustainable profitable growth. At this stage, given all of this, we expect gradual sequential performance improvement moving forward. In Q3, we paid $154 million in dividends to shareholders. We recognized that dividends are an important part of our capital allocation framework and returns to shareholders. And today we are very pleased to declare a Q4 dividend of $0.12 per share payable on October 7, 2020. On a personal note, I\u2019d like to echo Antonio's comments. We are both very proud of the way our company and team members quickly and decisively responded to the unprecedented challenges that the global COVID-19 pandemic has caused. As Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us at our Virtual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 15, where we will provide an update on our strategy, financial outlook and capital management policy. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Antonio Neri : All right. Thank you, Tarek Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Antonio, can you talk a bit about what customers are telling you, maybe on a geographic basis or looking at your segments, about what they're looking to invest in? How they're feeling about IT budgets? Clearly, some of the other large-cap tech companies have come under pressure. So I'm curious as to sort of the sentiment that you're hearing from customers in the channel as they look to the next couple of quarters? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thank you, Shannon. So, I spent probably 50% of my time talking to customers and partners. So, I have a pretty good insight of what we see in the market. What we see right now, first of all, and I made this comment in my remarks, we see steady demand and obviously, there are areas which are stronger than others. But the general sense is as follows; first of all, they're looking to strengthen their operations, and therefore, IT plays a huge role with that, and IT resiliency is more important than ever. So, anything that comes with security and enables them to digitize their processes is on the growth side. Second is, obviously, they have a lot of data and they need to get insight from that data and we see an acceleration of solutions related to AI and machine learning, and that's why our big data storage saw another great solid performance. But obviously, MLOps, and that's why we introduced an offer with HP GreenLake Cloud Services around machine learning operations is a high demand. Obviously, as we look at the workforce and I think there are permanent and lasting changes to how we're going to work in the future, remote connectivity is essential. And that's why I'm so excited about the acquisition of Silver Peak, because together with Aruba services platform, give us now the ability to provide connectivity for all the edges and the edge now is your home office, right? I consider that the micro branch to any cloud. And obviously, there are multiple clouds, because it's a hybrid strategy. And then anything that preserves CapEx is also in high demand. And that's why we see significant momentum with our HP GreenLake Cloud services, because that's a true conceived as-a-service offering. And so obviously, that's in transition, right? We see -- what we see is a transition period. But I would say the enterprise has been steady. Obviously, SMBE is a challenge. From the customer segmentation perspective, is a challenge. When I look at the verticals, I think the financial sector where you play is still very sector where you play is still very solid and the manufacturing side as well. Education, obviously, now is going to be very important. And in the public sector, the public sector is very strong. And obviously, we have a unique portfolio there with our HPC and AI solutions, but also around Storage as well. So, that's the general theme, Shannon, that we see at this point in time. In terms of budgets, obviously, they are assessing what happens in the context of their own revenues and profit. But overall, I will say the enterprise, which is where we participate the most, is fairly steady. And that's why Tarek meant, we have a very diversified and resilient portfolio, both by customer segment and by solution. Shannon Cross : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just looking at Compute, obviously, you had a benefit from the backlog. But underlying all of that, pricing, competition, component costs, I think you said that revenue was up even net of the backlog fulfillment. So, if you could just talk a bit about some of the underlying trends you're seeing there? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. The Compute business performed really well, 29% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. And we did a very good job in reducing the backlog. There's still some -- but that's why we feel very confident that we can totally get back to the historical levels by the end of Q4. We grew sequentially double digits in units, in AUP 3%. If you recall, commodity cost has been inflationary in the first part of the year, and we took quite significant actions on pricing. And that's why our AUPs went up because of pricing, but also because of the structural changes we continue to see in that type of products. I mentioned, we shipped 46 terabytes of storage. And that's not just storage in a traditional storage platform, it goes with the Compute, right, and for servers. I think, as you think about going forward, obviously, we'll continue to be very disciplined on pricing. In terms of commodity costs, but in particular, DRAM, we start seeing some declines, honestly. The curve is pointing downwards. But as I said before, and we lived this in 2018, right, when prices go up \u2013 when cost goes up, prices go up faster than when the cost goes down, it takes longer. But ultimately, the next-generation of Compute platform will drive even more richer configurations because there will be more per gigabyte per unit that will be attached to it. And so that's why we feel good about where we are today. But that's what we see in Compute right now is still very competitive, there's no question about it. But the demand is shifting between enterprise, public sector and obviously, the service provider segment. Operator : And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Antonio, thanks for those comments around Compute, but I was also wondering clearly, backlog conversion was -- helped a great deal within the quarter's performance on Compute, but you also showed growth in Compute on a year-on-year basis after a very long time. How are you thinking about this sustainability? Not just sort of going one quarter out, but just more sustainability across the next several quarters in terms of Compute growth? And if you could also comment on the deterioration and growth in edge, that would be helpful. And I have a follow-up for Tarek. Antonio Neri : Sure. I mean, as I said before, everything in our life computes, which means Compute is embedded everywhere, not just in a server, and a lot of our storage platform is basically a compute platform with software, right? Big Data storage is a great example of that. It is an Apollo platform that runs our AI software on it. It's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen there, but we saw steady demand again. We, obviously, are real locator resources, particularly in our go-to-market where we see the growth opportunity as well. And we will continue to drive what the focus is, particularly in areas like VDI, which is, in essence, is a Compute product with a bunch of software. Traditional Compute per se, in general purpose workloads, those obviously have been kind of weakened over time, been declining. But overall, I think a combination of AUPs, pricing, obviously, action and richer configuration, we should maintain a level of stability at this point in time considering that 2020 was fairly depressed overall. In terms of the edge, we believe we grew in line with the market. If I look at our competitors, what they announced, I think, is in line with the market. But we saw strength, as Tarek said, in switching, which was up sequentially 12%. Obviously, we continue to see quite a bit of strength in our subscription-based model with our Aruba platform. And also, we saw quite a bit of strength as well on the solutions around we provide, particularly of work solutions and remote connectivity. For us, this is a business that the long-term future. The thesis is totally intact. The Silver Peak acquisition will obviously accelerate the growth of Aruba going forward as well. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, Antonio. And Tarek, you noted in your comments, the seasonality in Q4 around free cash flow that it wouldn't be up seasonally, it would be down. Can you help us think through where in working capital you see the headwinds in 4Q? Is it on the inventory side, which significantly improved here in the third quarter? And what sort of magnitude of restructuring we should expect in 4Q as well? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Okay. Well, thank you, Wamsi, for the question. So let me start by answering the latter part of your question on the magnitude at the restructuring, it's pretty much in line with the guidance we gave you in Q2 for fiscal year 2020, $300 million to $400 million is the cost we would incur for the restructuring. Now back to the first part of your question with respect to free cash flow, free cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q3, as we work through the backlog, right? So this has been very, very solid. And particularly, we were able to work through the backlog and improve the cash conversion cycle. Also, we benefited from temporary favorable timing of working capital, and that component will reverse in Q4. And so in Q4, like I mentioned in my script, expect free cash flow to be lower than Q3 as a result of two components : one is the restructuring costs and number two, the working capital changes, and specifically, if you want a little bit more guidance as to where in working capital the change will come, it's predominantly in payables that you will see a change that will be adverse to the generation of free cash flow. Antonio Neri : I think there is another piece of this Wamsi. Maybe, Tarek, you want to comment about the inventory side of the house because we believe there is a lot of fluidity there. It's very fluid. And also, there are some opportunities. Shannon asked that question. So we're going to play the market-based on what we see opportunity for us. And therefore, this \u2013 in the end, it comes down to really timing \u2013 the bottom line is timing. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, that's absolutely right. So one of the reasons why you may wonder why we don't guide on free cash flow, although we guide on EPS, is because we do see opportunities that are available to us to take advantage of from an inventory position standpoint. And we want to retain the flexibility to be able to capitalize on those. Having said that, we do expect positive cash flow in Q4 lower than Q3 for the regions that I mentioned. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you put context around the $500 million of backlog worked down this quarter, as it relates to the overall size of excess backlog exiting April? And then as a follow-up, you talked about the really strong growth in GreenLake and customers shifting to OpEx models, but ARR growth did decelerate. Maybe talk through the factors that will get you back to the 30% to 40% growth target? And what the time line looks like in terms of hitting that growth profile? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. So thank you, Katy, and I'm sure you will all be normalizing for backlog on every aspect of our business. So I want to take the opportunity to clarify this and leaving no shadows for doubt. So as you recall, in Q2, we said we exited with executable backlog in excess of $1.5 billion, which was 2x the level that we would normally see in our operation. So, essentially, $750 million above the level that we normally have in our business. We reduced that $750 million by $500 million in Q3. The rest, we believe, we can reduce by Q4. So even if you normalize for the $500 million, and I'll let you do all the calculations, you will see that the underlying revenue performance Q3 on Q2 is better. And also, if you really ask where did that backlog get reduced, in which segment, in particular? It was mainly Compute in a tiny bit in Storage, that's where the $500 million come from. And even if you look at Compute, back onto Wamsi's questions before, and you normalize for the reduction in backlog, you will observe that Compute was growing sequentially even after the normalization. We also want to underscore the fact that the backlog reduction hides a little bit what happens at the gross margin level, right? It\u2019s very difficult for you to see this at your end. But we did -- both of us reiterate the fact that, with the pricing actions we have taken and once you normalize for backlog, both Compute and Storage flow their underlying gross margins going up. And this is partly the reason why we've done so well in growing our gross profit 8% sequentially in the year. So that hopefully answers the backlog question, or part of your question. On GreenLake, its true what you\u2019re saying that, Q-on-Q the ARR decelerated, but the practical reality is, where you look at the lead indicators that make the ARR is the order growth. The order growth that we've had in Q3, it's the record -- it's at record levels. We didn't experience an 82% order growth in GreenLake and we feel very good about this order growth, because we're seeing bigger deals with larger companies and the companies that Antonio quoted are not small companies that typically start with a little spend that is variable on their IT infrastructure. These are bigger companies that are considering as-a-service consumption as a new way to handle their IT expenditures. So Antonio, maybe you would like to add to that? Antonio Neri : Yes. Actually, I will say a couple of things to that comment on the backlog, Katy, I mean this is product shipped, right? Not all that product was totally recognizable in the quarter, particularly in HPC. Because if you remember, right, in the HPC segment, we got to ship it, we have to install it, we have to turn it on, and we have to run the test. And only and only when the customer signs up for the acceptance, then we can recognize revenue. And that's why we still have quite an interesting opportunity in Q4 with HPC in particular. But in Compute, once you ship it, you recognize it. So, overall, very pleased with that. But even when you factor the backlog out, we actually grew sequentially on net new orders. And the net new orders, to Tarek's point, came at higher margins because of our pricing actions. The problem is the backlog was kind of dilutive to the margins because we price protect our customers, obviously, and we stand on that commitment and also the channel, right? On the GreenLake, I mean, this is an amazing performance. As I said in my comment, I think, is -- we believe, I believe, it's faster growth than any cloud out there. And it has -- it really comes down to the ability to provide a hybrid experience. What customers are telling us, they don't want to be in the wrong side of the house anymore, but they understand they have to have apps and data everywhere. 70% of the apps and data, still on-prem, by the way and more apps in data are moving to the edge. But ultimately, even if they have apps in public cloud, they like the GreenLake because it provides them the cost control, the managed aspect of it, and we can run it for them in a truly hybrid approach. And when they keep the apps and data on-prem, we give them the exact same consumption model, or whether they move it to the edge. And their value proposition is resonating more and more because the world is hybrid, cloud is an experience, and obviously, our software capabilities, they are playing a huge role together with our innovation on the business model side, and obviously, the financing. So that's what we see. And the ARR will take care of itself because, obviously, there is puts and takes because remember, ARR is a consumption-driven metric of it and as we go forward, we are very, very confident to confident to hit that 30% to 40%. Operator : And our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to revisit this question of demand trends and how backlog can impact it. So, the way that I think of it is, last quarter, you built backlog, so you didn\u2019t ship $500 million worth of stuff that you should have shipped and so if I adjust for that, last quarter should have been $500 million higher. In this quarter, you actually shipped that and recognized $500 million, and so this quarter, adjusting for backlog, should be $500 million lower. So, if I look at that year-over-year revenue ex the $500 million boost in backlog, it's down 13%. But more importantly, sequentially, if I make those two adjustments, revenue is actually down about 3% sequentially, which should be a reflection of orders, if I make the backlog adjustment, and that's below normal seasonal. And so A, is that incorrect, that analysis? And B, I'd like to understand why that wouldn't point to the fact that the order rate actually might be getting a little worse rather than getting a little better? And I have a follow-up, please. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, Toni, hi it's Tarek here. So, your math is right. But operationally, things are slightly different, meaning if you normalize Q3 performance for the $500 million, yes, you get to $6.3 billion. But it's not entirely operationally correct to add the $500 million to Q2, because as part of the backlog, you do have orders that ship in-quarter but are not invoiced. You do have all, sorts of, different effects that come into play that distort that picture. So there is a limit to the normalization math that we can give. The simple point is, it's all about timing. Look, it's all about timing. This revenue should have materialized in fiscal year 2020. It is materializing in fiscal year 2020. And we're back to normalized levels of backlog by the end of fiscal year 2020. We've taken $500 million of backlog down. There's another -- you've done the math, $250 million to go. There's also another aspect that Antonio underscored before in HPC/MCS, it's very, very important for all of you to understand and it's the following. Specifically for that segment, it's slightly different than other segments because these systems are super sophisticated and even if we ship and land the system on customer premises, before we can actually invoice the customer, there's a technical acceptance process that takes place that delays our ability to invoice the customer. And so that is also fundamentally changing the trajectory of HPC/MCS, and we see very, very strong order demand in the public sector, which underpins the HPC/MCS segment, and you'll see the fruits of that in the foreseeable quarters. The conclusion of it is, whatever happens on backlog is an FY 2020 phenomenon driven by COVID, and they were essentially in Q1, the fact that we had, you remember, component shortages, and the whole industry experienced those. This translated into Q2 into manufacturing closures, where manufacturing was not at the full level. And then now, this issue has morphed into being specifically for HPC/MCS, a customer acceptance issue. So all-in-all, what matters is that the revenue of fiscal year 2020 is actually the same if you factor into the equation the fact that we will reduce the backlog we generated and we saw elevated at the end of Q2, we'll turn that into revenue by the end of Q4 in full. Antonio Neri : Yeah. I think, Toni, the other part is that we reduced the backlog by $500 million, but not all of that translated in Q3, because, again the HPC side of this, it takes -- sometimes takes weeks, some takes in months. We have installations, which are very large. It takes many, many weeks. And, obviously, the global pandemic, the COVID, is not allowing us to have a lot of people on-site for cabling and all that as well. And even if we ship it, in many cases, depending on the timing on the, kind of, more of the normal type of products, we may have a ship to not invoice, which basically, yeah, from the supply chain, it was taken care, but not from the revenue recognition perspective. That type of situation gets resolved, generally speaking, with a handful of weeks. On the HPC, it depends customer by customer. But the point on HPC is very strong. And, obviously, we have a go-forward amount of business, which is very sizable for us. And that's very good. Toni Sacconaghi : So, thank you for that. If I could just quickly follow-up. So if order rates are steady and you still have $250 million-plus in backlog given HPC, should we be modeling normal seasonality, which is up maybe a couple of hundred million sequentially, plus $250 million to $300 million from backlog pushout? Is that -- isn't that the literal interpretation of what you're suggesting? And then just on the Compute margins, they were down 440 basis points year-over-year despite flat volumes. Is that really the impact of the rising component prices? And should we expect that to reverse pretty sharply as a result over the next couple of quarters as you pass through price increases? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Okay. So I'd say, in simple terms, if you want to model this with seasonality factors that you've outlined, that is potentially correct. The only major shift here is this : the tide has come down across the industry. And it's not just for us, but overall, the level of demand is not going to be very quickly resuming to the levels we witnessed in fiscal year 2019. So the year-over-year compares that you're seeing are less and less meaningful. And what matters more is what happens on a sequential basis. This is why we are accentuating where we are recovering from Q2 into Q3 and now Q4 with the dynamics that Antonio mentioned with respect to HPC & MCS and customer acceptances. Toni, I apologize, could you repeat the second part of your question? I'm not sure I remember it. Toni Sacconaghi : Just Compute margins year-over-year, down 440, and does that improve as you pass along DRAM pricing? Tarek Robbiati : Yes. The answer is yes, Toni. That is correct. We've taken pricing actions. And as Antonio said, in these situations, we've lived those before in 2018, as we raise prices, the margin expands, and the commodity costs take longer to normalize or to revert back into a position when margins are deteriorating. And so we do believe that at least in the short term, if the DRAM pressure continues, we will see margin expansion in Compute. Antonio Neri : And the only thing I said, Toni, just to wrap the first part is that we feel confident that we will continue to see performance improvement as we go forward on a sequential basis. Question is, by how much? But the reality is about timing, it's about all these things that we just cover, converting orders and then ultimately be able to recognize revenue. But at this time, time, my early comments what we expect continued sequential performance improvement as we move forward. Operator : And our next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll make them quick as you're done at the end of the hour here. I wanted to ask back on Compute. I think, Tarek, you had said AUPs are up 3% sequentially. Could you say what that is year-over-year on AUP for Compute and then I'll just give you my follow-up now, so you don't have to come back to it. Could you just comment, maybe Antonio or Tarek, on visibility that you've got right now on demand, given your little bit better commentary on demand than what we've heard from some other big enterprise players? Thanks. Tarek Robbiati : Sure, Rod. Thanks for the question. So I'll say in Compute, units grew 36% quarter-on-quarter while AUP grew 3% quarter-on-quarter. I know you want the AUP on a year-over-year basis. I don't have that handy with you. I can follow-up and let you know what the answer is and the IR team will do that. And the second part of your question? Antonio Neri : And the second part of the question is about the demand visibility. As I said, depends by customer segment, depends by offer. Ultimately, what I see at this point in time has been steady. But the reality is that there are areas that are stronger and the areas are weaker. But I think it points to the diversification of our portfolio. We have a unique portfolio, and that's why we have a unique strategy to become the platform edge to cloud. And I think, as I think about that, obviously, there is a lot of opportunities, particularly as we continue to pivot the company with more software and services-oriented type of offers. And you can see even in Q3, some of the strength with big data Storage in our Primera, which is a software, in essence it\u2019s a software offering based on InfoSight, up over 100%. So these are the things that will continue to drive growth. And if we can sustain, the question that was asked about the Compute momentum, then you get that continued improvement, which we believe will be the case. But HPC plays a huge role for us. Let me be clear about HPC, I am very bullish about that business. Tarek Robbiati : And Rod, let me follow-up on the AUP questions on a year-over-year basis. On a year-over-year basis, units grew 3% and AUP was down 2%. That is the answer you were looking for. And on visibility, look, in simple terms, it's better than in Q2, and that's the reason why we provide guidance. If we didn't have a confidence, we wouldn't be providing guidance, if visibility were to be too low or too uncertain for us to do so. Operator : And our final question today will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for squeezing me in guys. I just have a question around your margin structure. Fairly impressive, I think, 100 basis points of margin uptick you guys saw sequentially. But when I kind of break it up, it looks like gross margins were down 170 basis points, and maybe more than made up for that in SG&A and R&D curtailment. So could you just maybe talk about first half gross margin decline? Was that all mix, or were there other factors involved in it? That would be helpful. And then, the OpEx run rate you have today, is this a steady state number we could think about as we go forward, or was there more one-off things that helped you curtail it? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you, Amit, for the question. So, yes, your observation is right. The gross margin went down 160 basis points, as highlighted in our announcement, and we more than made that at the OP margin level, with the OP margin at 7.1%. So what's driving that at the gross margin level is purely the mix. We had more Compute revenue at lower margin, it's a mix issue. We did also articulate the fact that if you normalize for backlog, we did have an impact on gross margins, both in Compute and Storage our gross margins would be up. But also, what you can see at OP margin is the fact that we are starting to take cost out and we are incurring restructuring costs as a result of this. I want to take the opportunity to remind everyone about our cost optimization and prioritization plan that we announced in Q2. We took proactive steps to strengthen our financial profile. I would tell you, I take a lot pride about this one, because we were present and we did it on time, being hit very hard in a full quarter of Q2 that was disrupted by COVID. And we are on track with that program to generate net annualized run rate savings of at least $800 million by the end of fiscal year 2022 relative to the fiscal year 2019 exit level and with most of those savings achieved at the end of fiscal year 2021. So hopefully, that should give you some comfort with respect to also the visibility point, and that's why we're saying, we expect gradual performance improvements going forward, knowing that we have taken actions with this core transformation program that is about prioritizing and reducing costs where we can find opportunities to do so. Antonio Neri : Yes. I will say, just to wrap that up, I know that was the last question, there is always quite interesting and significant opportunities. Remember that HPE Next was a very successful program for us and for our shareholders, and this is the next iteration. But most importantly, this is all about executing our strategy and align our resources to where we believe the growth is and continue to make this company even more efficient on a foundation of work we did the last three years. So, that's why we are very, very confident about that and we have a very strong discipline and track record to be honest with you, while at the same time, we focus on innovation. So, I know we went a little bit longer, but we felt that it was important to give you as much clarity and insight as possible. Again, I will wrap up by saying very pleased with Q3. This was a quarter marked by strong execution and honestly, very strong sequential growth. While much of the uncertainty is still there in the market and the global pandemic is still with us, we actually are cautiously optimistic, and we will see quarter-over-quarter improvements going forward across our businesses. And at the same time, we are investing into the future, which is essential for us, but I'm very pleased with our execution in the Pivot-as-a-Service. You can see the momentum there. Hopefully, we will see you in October at the virtual event for the Security Analyst Meeting. Thank you for your time and I hope to talk to you soon. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call today. Thank you for attending and you may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year with a very strong performance. In Q4 we saw a notable rebound in our overall revenue with particular acceleration in key growth areas of our business. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. As usual, I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to highlight our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide four, so now let me discuss our financial performance starting with slide five. I am very pleased to report that Q4 marked a return of revenue to pre-pandemic levels. We delivered Q4 revenues of $7.2 billion, up 5% sequentially and flat from a prior year period as our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC & MCS executed strongly. We also cleared our backlog by further $250 million during the quarter, which has now returned to normalize levels as we exited Q4. As a result of the improved revenue performance, we have grown non-GAAP gross profit by 7% sequentially to $2.2 billion in Q4. Non GAAP gross margins of 30.6% were also up sequentially driven by positive mix shift towards Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC/MCS, all of which reported strong sequential revenue growth. Our non-GAAP operating profit was up 15% sequentially, resulting in a 7.7% operating margin and our non-GAAP EPS of $0.37, was up 16% sequentially. Q4 cash flow from operations was $747 million, driven by strong operational execution. Free cash flow was $223 million and that was in line with our guidance, as we saw the expected reversal in the favorable working capital movements from elevated backlog in Q3. Finally, we paid $154 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January 2021. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment highlights in slides six and seven. As you can see, we are doing exactly what we said we would do at SAM in October. We are doubling down on our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS, while stabilizing our core business segments of Compute and Storage. In Intelligent Edge, we continued our momentum with 14% quarter-over-quarter and 5% year-over-year growth. We also expect to take share in both campus switching and wireless LAN with our best-in-class portfolio, which was just recognized as a leader for the 15th year in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for wired and wireless LAN access infrastructure. We are also beginning to see the operating profit potential of this business, with operating margin in Q4 of 10.1%, up 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 390 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from prior investments in this business. Finally, we closed the Silver Peak acquisition on September 21st, so it had a minimal contribution in Q4, but obviously Silver Peak will be more meaningful going forward. In HPC & MCS, revenue reached record levels near $1 billion, growing 50% sequentially and 25% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Cray, HPC Apollo and MCS. We executed well against our existing order book with increased customer acceptances and grew orders further with a healthy pipeline. As you know, this business can be lumpy with revenue recognition and profitability linked to completion of critical customer milestones. While we do expect to see a normal seasonal decline in Q1 \u201821, we are well on our way to delivering our 8% to 12% three-year revenue CAGR outlined at SAM. In Compute, revenue declined 7% sequentially, but was up low-single digits when normalizing Q3 and Q4 results for backlog conversion. Gross and operating margins were also pressured by clearing the backlog as we had to fulfill orders at cost levels higher than originally quoted. We are pleased to report that backlog has now returned to normalized levels. Thanks to continued improvements in our supply chain execution. Within Storage, we grew revenue 7% quarter-over-quarter driven by strong operational execution, reduced backlog and improved order momentum in key areas of the portfolio. We saw notable strength in big data, up 27% sequentially driven by increased customer focus on AI machine learning related applications, all-flash array storage up 19% sequentially by increase -- driven by increased adoption of Primera all-flash and dHCI, which grew double digits sequentially. We also expanded operating margins this quarter, which was up 380 basis points quarter-on-quarter ending at 16.7% of revenue and already aligned to our SAM fiscal year \u201823 targets. With respect to Pointnext Operational Services, which is included across our Compute, HPC/MCS and Storage segments, total revenue was up 2%, while orders were down 1% on a sequential basis. Additionally, our services intensity, which is the ratio of attach revenue per hardware units sold continued to be strong with notable strength in Compute and Storage, excluding Nimble, which were up low-single digits growth on a sequential basis. In Advisory and Professional Services, revenue was up 6% sequentially, even as COVID impacted consulting activity and the chargeability levels of our staff. Within HPE Financial Services, financing volume was up 6% and revenue was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, despite the impact of COVID-19. We maintained a solid return on equity of approximately 13% this quarter. Our bad debt loss ratio this quarter was 1.06%, which while slightly higher than previous quarters is still best-in-class and well within our comfort zone, as cash collections have already returned back to pre-COVID levels. In our Communications and Media Solutions business that is included in our Corporate Investments segment, orders were up 18% and revenue was up 6% sequentially, driven by strong double-digit orders and revenue growth in Americas. Additionally, due to our improved cost of delivery, we were able to expand operating margins by 240 basis points quarter-over-quarter. We continue to make good progress in our 5G core strategy that provides multi-vendor integration and true cloud-native telco network functions. Slide eight shows key metrics of our growing as-a-service business, which I elaborated on during our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. We are making great strides in our AAS offering. I am pleased to report that our Q4 \u201820 ARR came in at $585 million, representing 11% quarter-over-quarter and 30% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 20% year-over-year, driven by outstanding performance in North America and APJ. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also continued to grow revenues strong double digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is delivering and progressing towards its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year \u201820 fiscal year \u201823, set at our 2019 SAM and reiterated at our 2020 SAM meeting. Slide nine highlights our revenue and EPS performance to-date, where you can clearly see Q2 was a trough. Strong operational execution has driven sequential revenue growth from a low of $6 billion in Q2 all the way back to $7.2 billion in Q4. Turning to slide 10, the rebound in revenue has resulted in a 15% improvement in non-GAAP gross profit from the Q2 trough, which was up to $2.2 billion in Q4. Also, the gross margin rate in Q4 of 30.6% of revenues was up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by a higher mix of Intelligent Edge, Storage and HPC/MCS, which are higher margin businesses, offset by continued execution of elevated Compute backlog, which was a headwind but is now behind us. Moving to slide 11, you can see how the improvement in gross profit combined with progress on our cost optimization plan has delivered 53% growth in operating profit from the Q2 trough, while still investing for growth. As mentioned at SAM, we are making excellent progress in our cost optimization and prioritization plan, which will strengthen our financial foundation, while aligning resources to critical growth areas. As of the end of this quarter, we are on track to deliver annualized net run rate savings for at least $800 million from the FY \u201819 baseline by the end of fiscal year \u201822, with most of the savings being realized by the end of fiscal year \u201821. Obviously, we will keep you updated on our progress in the upcoming quarters. Turning to slide 12, we generated cash flow from operations of $747 million and free cash flow was $223 million for the quarter, driven by timing of working capital movements from clearing backlog that resulted in favorability in Q3, but a headwind we flagged for in Q4. We ended fiscal year \u201820 with free cash flow of $560 million in line with our outlook provided at SAM 2020. Looking to \u201821, we expect free cash flow to grow over 75% at the midpoint of our outlook of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Please remember our normal cash flow seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash flow than the first half. Now moving on to slide 13, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet and liquidity position, which is a competitive advantage in the current environment. As our October 31st quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash after successfully redeeming $3 billion of bonds maturing in October 2020 and paying approximately $853 million net of cash, excuse me, $853 of net cash for closing the Silver Peak transaction. Together, with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottomline, we have a strong cash position and ample liquidity available to run our operation, continue to invest in our business and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on slide 14, at our recent Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year \u201821 and I would encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me drill down on a few key areas. We continue to expect to grow our fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP operating profit by 15% to 20% and now expect FY \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be between $1.60 to $1.78, as a result of increased confidence in margin improvement. This is a $0.03 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior guidance of a $1.56 to $1.76 in EPS. From a topline perspective, we are pleased with the rebound we saw in Q4 and continue to see gradual improvement, but want to remain somewhat cautious due to the uncertain pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically for Q1 \u201821, after normalizing for excess backlog reduction in Q4 \u201820 of $250 million, we expect Q1 \u201821 revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4. For fiscal year \u201821, we expect total revenue to be in line with our long-term financial targets of a CAGR of 1% to 3% presented in our recent Securities Analyst Meeting. For Q1 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.06 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.40 to $0.44. So overall, I am very pleased with the performance in the quarter and execution against our strategy and financial priorities outlined at SAM. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges this fiscal year and had a very strong finish. Q4 was marked by a strong rebound in revenue as we reduced backlog to normalized levels and saw increased order momentum across all business segments. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our growth businesses of Intelligent Edge and HPC/MCS. Our core business of Compute and Storage is pointing to signs of stabilization and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. We have been proactive in strengthening our financial foundation and aligning resources to critical areas to transform our core. This will ultimately drive sustainable profitable growth and shareholder returns for the long run. Let me close by reiterating that I am very proud of what we have accomplished as a team during very challenging and uncertain times, and we look forward to fiscal year \u201821. Now with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator :  And our first question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to go into the Compute segment a little bit more. First of all, can you talk a little bit about the demand linearity you saw throughout this October quarter? And just as we move forward, how do I think about the operating profitability, if I look back in fiscal \u201819, I think, the average operating margin was somewhere in the 11.5% range, this quarter it was 6%, averaging about 7% this last fiscal year. So I am just trying to understand what is the kind of normalized operating margin profile of that Compute business? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Tarek? Tarek Robbiati : All right. So, look, if you look at total revenue in Compute, as Antonio said, and I think, I reiterated too, revenue was up low-single digits when you normalize for Q3 and Q4 for backlog conversion, right? So, considering where we were at the end of Q2, the team did an outstanding job of driving supply chain efficiencies and clearing that backlog. The backlog is no more a problem. It\u2019s back to normalized levels. Specifically, with respect to order trends and momentum, order trends were encouraging and then this is pointing to further stabilization in this business. And most importantly, if you look on a combined view for servers across Compute and HPC/MCS, which is how the market tracks server\u2019s performance, our total net revenue in the servers would be up low-single digits sequentially and up low-double digits sequentially, if you exclude the impact of backlog in Q3 and Q4. So we feel we gained revenue market share in total servers for the second consecutive quarter. Now when you look at margins in that context, gross and operating margins were pressurized by clearing backlog as we had to fulfill orders in Q4 at cost levels higher than they were originally quoted. Having said that, we are pleased to report now again that the backlog has returned to normalized levels and we continue to improve our supply chain execution. As we continue to stabilize this business, we expect gross margins to expand now that backlog is no longer an issue and mix shift to more profitable market segments. We also continue to optimize R&D and sales investments, and expect to achieve an operating profit margin of 10% to 12%. This is what we told you as part of our long-term outlook provided at SAM. Antonio Neri : So I just want to emphasize a couple of points that I hope that, I think got lost through Tarek\u2019s commentary here, because he provided a lot of insight. Our orders in Compute without China, because as you know we have a difference, it was up 2% quarter-over-quarter, our new orders. And then as we think about the total server category, which is Compute plus HPC plus MCS, you combine all of that and basically when you normalize for the backlog, we would have been up quite a bit sequentially and up low-single digits year-over-year and that\u2019s why we believe we have gained share in total server revenue. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks for the question, Aaron. Operator, can we go to the next one please? Operator : And our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could drill down on what\u2019s occurring in the Intelligent Edge business. In particular, we see a couple of crosscurrents, maybe macro recovery would be helpful, but this could be offset by increased work-from-home. So there\u2019s this debate about how this business may trend? And on top of that, I have the impression that you expect to gain market share from some of your larger competitors. I wonder if you could help us understand how you weigh these various crosscurrents when you look out over calendar \u201821 opportunities for the Intelligent Edge? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah. Thank you for the question. I mean, we committed to doubling down on the Edge two years ago, where I went on to state that the Intelligent Edge is the next big frontier. And when you think about digital transformation, all starts with a connectivity. And in order to participate in the digital transformation, you need connectivity, you need security and then ultimately you need to bring the cloud computing, where the data is created and we have now seen that the vast majority of the data is created outside the data center, outside the big cloud and more and more where we live and work. Obviously, the pandemic has validated what I said two years ago that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And when I think about our Q4 performance and I am going to speak organically, because the Silver Peak acquisition was just four weeks, five weeks in our numbers. We grew year-over-year versus our competitors in the traditional space whether its Cisco,  orders declined and that\u2019s why we believe we are going to gain share. And the reason why we believe the momentum will continue is not just because of the transformation that we see in customers, particularly as we are going to be in a much more distributed enterprise where connectivity has to be ubiquitous, it\u2019s because we have a cloud native solution. It is important that the street understands our Aruba Edge Services platform is a software company and provides cloud connectivity from the cloud with security, analytics, AI and all the things that you need in this environment at massive scale and it has been designed for devices, people and things. And that\u2019s why we have in that platform today more than 65,000 customers and we are adding 14,000 new devices every single day and that momentum is all about the experience we can provide and this is why we saw the 14% growth sequentially and also we saw the 5% year-over-year growth. But what is interesting is it is a software-as-a-service growth because ultimately that contributes to our ARR. And by the way, our switching was up sequentially high-single digits versus our competitor down and our wireless LAN was up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, we believe we have something special and unique here right at the middle where the customer demand is. I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you want to add any commentary. Tarek Robbiati : That\u2019s absolutely right, Antonio. There\u2019s one thing I can add from a financial standpoint is, we do project that the edge is going to outgrow the market, given the strong differentiation that the Aruba Edge Services platform provides as Antonio described and we see revenue growing at a 6% to 10% CAGR over the next three years from FY \u201820 to FY \u201823 and this will come with enhanced profitability. We ended Q4 with a 10.1% op margin, up 150 basis points. Longer term, we expect operating margins to progress upwards, through the teens with more scale and richer gross margins from higher software content such as the Aruba Services platform including the contribution from Silver Peak. Antonio Neri : And I think you should walk away with three key trends, so that you can put that in context. One is, Wi-Fi for secured remote worker solutions. Wi-Fi 6 refresh, which is a pull-through for switching because of the architecture and obviously the acceleration as for SD-WAN, which obviously Silver Peak plays a huge role. And last but not least, we see an increased demand in NaaS, which is network-as-a-service, which obviously is a component of our HPE GreenLake offering. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks for the question, Simon. Operator, can we go to the next one please? Operator : And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Hi. Yes. Thank you. Congrats on the strong execution and solid quarter. Antonio, you are back at pre-pandemic revenue levels for overall revenue and your growth segments are performing impressively. Do you see this as a sign that enterprise spending is coming back stronger than you thought 90 days ago? And Tarek, if I could, can you just give us an update on the roughly $2 billion of payments that are potentially coming your way from Oracle and how you would deploy that if you got that over the next year? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. I mean I will say we are very encouraged by the all the momentum we have. Obviously, there\u2019s still quite a bit of uncertainty out there. We are still subscribed to our thesis that Tarek and I discussed in Q2 which is a U shaped recovery. But what I am really pleased is that order momentum and the sequential growth that we continue to see, and the demand particularly in the growth areas, but also very pleased with what is pointed to the stabilization of the core business. The fact that our Compute orders grew sequentially 2% is very, very good. We also saw a sequential growth in Storage in orders and I think it\u2019s pointed to different solutions, Wamsi. Obviously, we see in our containers, we see bare metal applications, we see everything that\u2019s workload optimized, data recovery is one aspect of it, VDI is another aspect of it. I think there is a shift in not just buying infrastructure, but that type of infrastructure which is way more optimized. And one of the things we see obviously is GreenLake. GreenLake is a driving force for pulling through our portfolio and when you pull that portfolio through, Compute and Storage win and that\u2019s where we discussed at SAM, not only we need to focus on the stabilization, but the transformation of that business to become more software and silicon-oriented, which the example of that is we introduced our Silicon Root of Trust Version 2.0, which is the most secure platform on the planet. But what is interesting, if you listen to some of our competitors, including today, they say that 96% of the spend is still on-prem. This is not my words. It\u2019s a big cloud provider who said that. And that transition is an important transition for us to capture and that\u2019s where we went ahead with our on-premise solutions as-a-service. So that\u2019s where I think there is definitely stabilization in demand. There is increased demand in certain areas associated with connectivity, AI, data. We see more workload optimized solution. We see more IT resiliency needed at this point in time and that\u2019s where, as we enter Q1, we enter with a very strong momentum on orders and that\u2019s where we were confident with Tarek to raise our guidance for the year. Oracle? Tarek Robbiati : Wamsi, so the question on Oracle. So, yes, we have not forgotten about that one, of course. Let me remind everybody where we stand. There was a $3 billion roughly jury verdict in HPE\u2019s favor in the Itanium matter. That matter remains on appeal. The renewed judgment now stands at $3.8 billion in total with interest accruing at 10% since May 2019, so an interesting interest rate here. The appeal has been fully briefed and we are awaiting the California Court of Appeal to schedule oral arguments. Although, we are hopeful that we will receive a ruling from the California Court of Appeal in 2021, obviously the timing of this is out of our control. We remain confident that the outcome on appeal will be favorable to HPE and also I want to remind you all that we would have to share any sort of payment with our cousins at HP Inc. Antonio Neri : Correct. Thanks, Wamsi. Andrew Simanek : Great. Yeah. Thanks, Wamsi. Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Your next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thanks. This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. I wanted to get an update on your HPC & MCS business. During your recent Analyst Day, you alluded to this business in addition to Intelligent Edge being contributors to growth and clearly this quarter puts an emphasis on that viewpoint. Can you perhaps highlight some of the underlying demand vectors for a business that\u2019s been historically lumpy in nature, perhaps, the durability of this level growth looking forward and perhaps progress on reaching customers beyond Cray\u2019s historically public sector customer base? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Yeah. Well, that\u2019s part of the thesis why we combined Cray with the organic portfolio HPE had. You need to look at the segmentation of the business. Obviously, Cray plays on the top end of the supercomputer market with a unique set of technologies both in software and silicon. That\u2019s very important to understand. Cray brought to us a fully verticalized stack from the silicon, particularly in the interconnect fabric to the entire software to manage these very specialized workloads which is a significant point of differentiation for us. And then the HPE Apollo, which is a platform I actually introduced when I was running the Compute business in 2013, plays more in the mid-range and the low end in a density optimized and other types of workloads. The combination drives tremendous synergies across the entire segment and it\u2019s true it is lumpy. No question about it. But it\u2019s lumpy because the way the mechanics works in term of revenue recognition. So in this business, obviously, you take the order, then you have the time to build it. It takes some times months to build one of the systems. You have to ship it, you have to install it, you have to run the workload and only when the customer give us acceptance we can recognize revenue. But remember, what we showed at SAM is the fact that we have more than $2 billion in backlog, meaning awarded business that we expect to ship between \u201821 and \u201822, and that business is already won, okay? And some of those include exascale systems, which obviously, we shared the data with you, which we won five out of six. But since SAM, we won new deals and I quoted some of those in my opening remarks, like the Pawsey deal and the European Union deal and these are typical. And the reason why we win is because we have a very set of specialized technology. And the need to collocate data in Compute is unique. And that\u2019s why not only we continue to grow the business at the pace you saw, but also we own 39 of the Top 500 supercomputers and we own 37% of the share. So we are very pleased with this business. Our thesis is coming through and the reason is because of data. Data is exploding, AI is now a democratized tool in many ways. You need high-performance computing capabilities to run it. By the way, we see now the momentum on margins too, right, because now we own more of that stack. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Irvin. Appreciate the question and Operator, next one please? Operator : And our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I was wondering, Antonio, if you can talk a bit about your thoughts behind the headquarters move and any potential cost savings not from layoffs, but perhaps lower taxes in that? And then, I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you can just confirm that the cost of the new building was included within your free cash flow estimates? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. Listen, as we look into the future, our business needs opportunities for cost savings, simplifying our footprint. And also remember we learned quite a bit, Shannon, about the team preferences about the future to work. Altogether, we made the decision to relocate the headquarters. Let me be clear, our technological hub for innovation, particularly in Aruba, Software and Storage is in Silicon Valley. And basically what we are doing is consolidating our Silicon Valley footprint in the state of our San Jose headquarters that we opened last year. This is our technological hub. Now, for non-technical hub and as jobs, we decided to move the headquarters to Texas, because you have access to diverse talent and ability to attract and retain is unique and differentiated. So, what we are creating here is two very strong hubs with clear mandates on each of them. From the taxes perspective, there is none, because we are incorporated in Delaware to begin with. Definitely our savings associated with the real estate because you rationalize the Bay Area footprint, you expect savings. The cost of that new site in Houston was already included in our numbers because we already were building that since 2000 -- beginning of 2020. That was already in the plan. We are not changing anything. So, we are just relocating that. And what we are doing for the unique job functions that we believe are better suited to be in Houston, we are offering the voluntary move to the employees and there will be no jobs impact in California. So that\u2019s pretty much it and we are creating again two very strong hubs for our company, and rationalize the footprint that will drive cost savings over time, which by the way they are part of project accelerate as we go along. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Shannon. And Operator, next question please? Operator : And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thanks. Good afternoon. What have you seen in Europe as markets have -- as some of those markets have shutdown and do you view that as a path to what you might see in the U.S. over the next few months? And then just as it relates to demand in the October quarter, any difference in trends between the commercial enterprise and public sector? Antonio Neri : Yeah. Katy, I mean, Europe was strong for us. I mean, honestly, the lockdown is happening as we speak maybe in the last two weeks to three weeks in some markets. But I have to say, no real impact at this point in time that we can see. We again exit October with the momentum and a good order book getting to Q1. The momentum is being cut in November. But again there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty out there. I am not sure yet what real impact it is. I also will say that customers are now kind of accustomed to deal with this way to work, obviously, we have been now nine months, 10 months in this situation and so business continues. There may be -- certain things may be slowed down over time because you need to access the certain facilities. But overall, I haven\u2019t seen anything in particular right now. Commercial seems to be improving. And then, on the public sector side, obviously, we participate particular with HPC and that continue to be very, very strong, I will say. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Katy. Operator, next question please? Operator : And our next question will come from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Jeriel Ong : Thank you so much for squeezing me in. Revenues, it\u2019s nice to see this revenue trend kind of get back to that flat year-on-year range? But if I really look at the gross and operating margins, there are still deltas on a year-on-year basis. I understand the normalization of backlog may have something to do with the modeling of this? But I guess going forward as you -- with your forecasting of fiscal \u201821, what are the prospects for margin normalization back into those fiscal \u201819 figures? Thanks. Tarek Robbiati : Hi, Jeriel. Thanks for the question. So, if you refer back to our outlook on revenue that we provided at SAM and that was a 1% to 3% CAGR growth of revenue that we reiterated today as we issued our guidance for fiscal year \u201821. We also said that we expect operating profit to grow 15% to 20% over next year. And so when you take the combination of the revenue growth, which is outpaced by the operating profit growth, yeah, surely there will be operating margin expansion. And what\u2019s fueling that expansion is the cost optimization and prioritization program, which is well on track and most of the benefits of that program will be attained towards the end of fiscal year \u201821. And I want to remind everybody that we are foreseeing $800 million of net run rate savings of the fiscal year \u201819 baseline and so you can infer from this where the margins would be by the end of fiscal year \u201821 leading into fiscal year \u201822. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Jeriel. Operator, I think, we have got time for just one last question, please. Operator : And that question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to come back to the Financial Services business and particularly the write-off percentage and the increase there. I know there\u2019s a little bit of seasonality there, Tarek, but it seems like that\u2019s up a little bit. I am just curious if you could say a word about. I know you have said it\u2019s a healthy absolute level, but a word about what it tells us about the end market and whether you would expect that to decline in the January quarter? And then, I assume the return on equity there is still relatively low, because you guys are forgiving payments. But could you just update us on that payment forgiveness plan and is that over, are you still doing it, just kind of give us an update on where that stands as well? Thanks. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you, Rod. It\u2019s a really good question. So when you look at the Financial Services business, the bad debt loss ratio is just over 1%. It\u2019s up modestly. I am very comfortable personally with that level, given what happened in the pandemic and we are absolutely satisfied with the way the business unit has performed. The team has worked incredibly hard to give payment holidays to certain customers who needed it. This is why year-over-year you see the revenue dropping, but the profitability hasn\u2019t dropped dramatically at all and that is testing of the way the management team has performed this year. And it\u2019s actually what that translates into is an extremely strong position for the future, because what happened is that you had contract extended as a result of those payment holidays quote-unquote and when those contracts extend that over time leads to higher returns as you know in the leasing space. So, on the whole I feel very positive about the performance of HPEFS. I want to reiterate cash collections, have already returned to pre-COVID levels, which is good, economically, it\u2019s a sound position also for the economy. We are now collecting cash on deferrals granted earlier in the year and that level of deferral was granted to a small subset of the customers, and we do expect the return on equity to trend back to the 15% plus levels over the next couple of years. Antonio Neri : All right. Thanks, Tarek. Rod Hall : Okay. Antonio Neri : I know there may be some more questions, Andy, but I know you and Tarek will do some call backs as well and so there will be opportunity for those who were not able to put a question into answer the question. In any case, I just want to finish by saying that Q4 was marked by a very strong rebound in our total company revenue. We are pleased with the results. While much uncertainty still exists in the overall market. I am confident in our team\u2019s ability to execute the strategic priorities we shared with you, particularly SAM, which we believe will position us to drive future sustainable profitable growth. And again thank you for joining the call today -- joining us today on the call and I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. Happy holidays to you and your families. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call today. Thank you and at this time you may now disconnect.",

My name is Cole and I will be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call.  And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Andrew Simanek, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I am Andy Simanek, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2021 first quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Tarek Robbiati, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. It is hard to comprehend everything that has transpired around the world over the last year. The world we knew pre-pandemic has changed forever, and the need to use innovative technologies to advance the way people live and business operate has never been greater. Improving the health of our communities from educating our children to digitizing our economy and enable its recovery creates an enormous opportunity. I believe we are entering a new year, the age of insight, fueled by the amount of data around us. The arrival of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines is a marvel of innovation and good news for us all, bringing hope and optimism for what lies ahead. I am personally very excited about the future of innovation and the impact it will have. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year \u201821. As usual, I will be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on Slide 1 and now let me discuss our financial performance and KPIs, starting with Slide 2. I am delighted to report that our Q1 results were marked by continued momentum in revenue, substantial gross and operating margin expansion and robust cash generation. We delivered Q1 revenues of $6.8 billion, down 3% from the prior year period, but better than our typical historical sequential seasonality when normalizing for Q4 backlog. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin returned to above pre-pandemic levels and was up 30 basis points from the prior year period and up 300 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Our operating expenses decreased year-over-year, thanks to our ongoing structural efficiency measures as well as some timing-related benefits related to hiring in key selected areas, which have been pushed out. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 11.3%, up 130 basis points from the prior year, which translates to an 11% year-over-year increase in operating profit. As a result of our strong execution, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, which was up 4% from the prior year and significantly above the higher end of our outlook range. Q1 cash flow from operations was close to $1 billion, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital timing benefits. Q1 free cash flow was $563 million, which was up approximately $750 million from the prior year and a record level for any first HPE first quarter. Finally, we paid $155 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April 2021. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment highlights on Slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities, delivering 11% year-over-year growth, our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. Switching was up 5% year-over-year with double-digit growth in North America. And wireless LAN was up 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in both North America and APJ. Additionally, the Aruba SaaS offering was up triple digits year-over-year and is now a significant contributor to HPE overall ARR. Based on our solid performance, we expect to take share again this quarter in both campus switching and wireless LAN. We are also seeing the significant operating profit potential of this business with operating margins in Q1 of 18.9%, up 680 basis points year-over-year as we drove greater productivity from past investments and operational leverage benefits kick in. Finally, I am pleased to say we recognized our first full quarter of revenue from the acquisition of Silver Peak, the premium growth SD-WAN leader, which contributed approximately 500 basis points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. In HPC and MCS, revenue declined 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the inherent lumpiness of the business, which is linked to the timing of deals and customer acceptance milestones. We remain very confident in the near-term and longer-term outlook for this business and are reaffirming our full year and 3-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%, respectively, as highlighted at SAM. We have an extremely strong order book of over $2 billion worth of awarded exascale contracts with another $5-plus billion of market opportunity over the next 3 years. Finally, we announced the launch of our HPC as-a-Service offer, which we expect to gain traction later this year and become a further contributor to our overall growing ARR profile. In Compute, revenue stabilized to a 2% year-over-year decline, but was up low single digits sequentially when normalizing for Q4 backlog, which attest of a strong order momentum in the quarter. Gross and operating margins were up meaningfully quarter-over-quarter due to the absence of any backlog-related margin impact, improved supply chain execution and the rightsizing of the cost structure of this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.5%, up 80 basis points from prior year period and at the high end of our long-term margin guidance for this segment provided at SAM. Within Storage, revenue declined 6% year-over-year, driven by difficult prior year compare, but with strong growth in software-defined offerings. We are extremely well positioned in Storage with Primera and Nimble dHCI. Our most software rich platforms, they are both growing triple digits year-over-year. They are absolute winners in the market, and Primera is on track to surpass 3PAR sales as early as next quarter. We also saw notable strength in overall Nimble, up 31% year-over-year, and total all-flash arrays were up 5% year-over-year. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms helped drive storage operating profit margins to 19.7%, well above our long-term outlook for this segment presented at SAM last October. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue stabilized and was flat year-over-year, driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling products and services as bundles, improved services intensity and are growing as-a-service business, which I remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very important to note because all of our services \u2013 all of our OS revenue is recurring with 3-year average contract length, and OS remains the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, revenue stabilized and was slightly down 1% year-over-year. As expected, we are seeing sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios, ending this quarter at approximately 0.9%, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen strong cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 110 basis points on the prior year. And our return on equity is back to a pre-pandemic high-teens level of 16.5%. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to last quarter, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering this quarter with over 70 new GreenLake logos added in Q1. I am very pleased to report that our Q1 21 ARR came in at $649 million, representing 27% year-over-year reported growth. Total as-a-service orders were up 26% year-over-year, driven by very strong performance in Europe and Japan. Our HPE Aruba Central SaaS platform also contributed to grow revenues strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving its ARR growth targets of 30% to 40% CAGR from fiscal year \u201820 to fiscal year \u201823, which I am reiterating today. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from our Q2 trough. Revenue returned back to near pre-pandemic levels last quarter. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have nearly doubled EPS from the trough and are now growing year-over-year. Turning to Slide 6, we delivered a non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q1 of 33.7% of revenues, which was up 300 basis points sequentially and 30 basis points from the prior year period. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, the absence of backlog-related headwinds we had in the second half of last year, operational services, margin expansion from cost takeout and automation and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and Storage. Moving to Slide 7, you can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins, which is up 280 basis points sequentially and 130 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits while simultaneously maintaining our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q1 operating expenses also benefited from delayed hiring and a push-out of select investments that we will be making to drive further growth. Turning to Slide 8, we generated record levels of first quarter cash flows. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow was $563 million for the quarter, up approximately $750 million from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some working capital in year timing related benefits. Now moving on to Slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet, liquidity position, which are a competitive advantage in the current environment. As of our January 31 quarter end, we had approximately $4.2 billion of cash on hand. Together with an undrawn revolving credit facility of $4.75 billion at our disposal, we currently have approximately $9 billion of liquidity. Finally, I would like to reiterate that we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which was recently reaffirmed by the rating agencies. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity to run our operations, continue to invest in our business to drive growth and execute on our strategy. Now turning to outlook on Slide 10, at our October 2020 Securities Analyst Meeting, we provided our outlook for fiscal year \u201821, which we raised by $0.03 at the midpoint to $1.60 to $1.78 in our last earnings release. Today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we are raising our fiscal year guidance for fiscal year \u201821 once again to reflect our strong operational performance to date and confidence in our outlook. We now expect to grow our fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP operating profit by over 20% and expect to deliver fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.70 to $1.88, which is a $0.10 per share improvement on the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.60 to $1.78. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in Q1. And whilst we continue to see gradual improvement, we remain prudent as we and the rest of the world continue to navigate the pandemic and related macro uncertainties. More specifically for Q2 \u201821, we expect revenue to be slightly better than in line with our normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q1. This still represents double-digit year-over-year growth from the $6 billion trough of Q2 of fiscal year \u201820. Now with respect to supply chain, I would like to remind everyone that we exited Q4 of fiscal year \u201820 with higher levels of inventory to protect against the risk of a short-term supply squeeze and address improved customer demand. With these actions and other proactive steps that we\u2019ve taken in Q1, we do not expect any meaningful impacts on our supply chain in the near-term. We are now turning our attention to working on strengthening our inventory supply for the second half of fiscal year \u201821 as we see improved levels of demand, recognizing also that we have entered an inflationary environment for memory components. For Q2 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.02 to $0.08 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow this quarter and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year \u201821 free cash flow guidance from our SAM guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion to a revised outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, a $250 million increase at the midpoint. So overall, Antonio and I are proud of these results. We have navigated well through unprecedented challenges in the last fiscal year and have started the new fiscal year strong out of the gate. We saw significant acceleration and customer demand in our Intelligent Edge business and the order pipeline in our HPC MCS business remains robust. Our core business of Compute and Storage revenues are stabilizing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR continues to show strong momentum aligned to our outlook. As a result of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we are emerging from an unprecedented crisis as a different company, one that is much leaner, better-resourced and positioned to capitalize on the gradual economic recovery currently at play. We are already seeing the benefits of our actions in our improved margin profile and free cash flow outlook. Now, with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Andy? Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Tarek. First question, please. Thank you. Operator : Certainly.  Our first question today will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. I\u2019m curious, everyone is talking about digital transformations, and they seem to have really gained traction early in COVID with the need for remote work. But now could you talk a bit about how customer priorities and purchase decisions are changing as we\u2019re moving past COVID? And I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s an opportunity for more consultative sales and higher ASPs margin. If you could talk about it maybe by segment, that would be helpful because I assume it may vary across your business lines? Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Thanks, Shannon. Yes. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Shannon. Yes. I will take that, Andy. Well, we definitely still see the tailwind of what we saw in 2020. Obviously, we work in a much more distributed environment. We talked about this all the time about the fact that many employees will never return to the office, and they need access to data and services in a very connected way. And so that\u2019s why we believe our Aruba business, it is a digital transformation engine for our customers. It is not just about access to a Wi-Fi port, but it\u2019s also the fact that provides that edge-to-cloud connectivity for all the apps and data, wherever they live. So what we see though is an acceleration for definitely the access to data, the analytics side. We see AI machine learning taking holding every segment of the market because data insights is necessary to compete in this new digital economy. We see, obviously, the need to improve IT resiliency based on the learnings we had in 2020. We see also the need to deploy cloud everywhere. And remember, our definition of the cloud is an experience, not a destination. And that\u2019s why we are very bullish about our HPE GreenLake cloud services. The pipeline, the size of the deal, the need to engage in a consultative application-driven conversation is increasing. And that\u2019s where we have aligned our advisory and professional services to that part of the business. So I think there is going to be a mix of things, Shannon. But ultimately, digital transformation is no longer a priority. It is a strategic imperative. And those who move fast around the data insights and digitizing everything will be the winners. No question. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Great, thank you, Shannon. Operator, can we go to the question, please? Operator : And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Hi. Yes, thank you and congrats on the nice execution, and especially the strong cash flow performance. Antonio, you noted some solid order linearity. I was wondering if you can talk about any meaningful changes that you\u2019re seeing in your customer conversations around recovery and enterprise demand. And what are some of the key assumptions around the upside to the EPS and cash flow guide? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, maybe I\u2019ll start, and then I would like Tarek to talk about the EPS upside. Listen, I spent more than 50% of my time talking to customers and partners, and I see a renewed focus on making sure the businesses are positioned for success. Definitely, there is a need to modernize their infrastructure and deploy these new technologies across the board. Our order linear intake, Wamsi, it was very solid every single week of the quarter. There was no one week that was higher than others. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised about that. The way I manage the business with my team, a quarter has 13 weeks because when you go into a quarter, you already have a week of backlog and then you drive your linearity from there. And it was very consistent. It was across all businesses. As Tarek said, our Compute business saw sequential growth in our order intake, the same in our areas of the Storage portfolio, where we are pivoting, particularly everything that\u2019s software-defined. Aruba was very strong out of the gate, and we see the momentum going through 2021. GreenLake the same thing, but ultimately, their vision of edge-to-cloud is paying off because ultimately, customers need that architecture and a set of services that they can deliver what they need in this digital transformation. So we feel very confident about that. And that\u2019s why we are confident in raising the outlook, which Tarek gave you the insights about the EPS upside. So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about that? Tarek Robbiati : Sure, Antonio. Wamsi, thanks for the question. We feel very good about our guidance for the second quarter and the full year \u201821. We did express in our scripts that we see our non-GAAP operating profit growing by over 20% year-over-year, and our guidance reflect that. Now when you look at our margins for this quarter and the need to proceed with select investments, we feel that the guidance that we have on an EPS level is achievable, particularly when you look at the improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2 and for the rest of the year, as Q3 and Q4 are usually strong quarters for our businesses such as the Intelligent Edge and also Storage. With respect to cash flow, our guidance has improved by $250 million at the midpoint, and it\u2019s a reflection of the improved outlook on operating profit. I am very pleased to put forward the guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion in free cash flow and we will see as the year progresses, how this guidance will translate in actual results. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Wamsi. Can you go to the next question, please? Operator : And our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thanks for taking the question and also congrats on the quarter from me as well. I want to ask about the margin profile. Tarek, when you think about the performance that we\u2019ve seen this last quarter and you think about the mix of the business going forward, I guess, how do you think about the continued upward levers on gross margin? And can you just remind us of where we stand on the $800 million net savings initiatives from an OpEx perspective? Where we stand at now and what\u2019s left in terms of that target by the exit of fiscal \u201822? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure, Aaron. Thank you for the question. So let\u2019s pick up gross margin first, and then we\u2019ll talk about our cost optimization, resource allocation program. On gross margin, we feel very good that now that we\u2019ve put behind us all the effects from backlog in Q3, Q4 of last year. We\u2019re now operating the business in the context where we have normal business flows between orders and supply chain delivery. And we do acknowledge, like we said before, that there is an inflationary environment on some commodities such as DRAM. But we feel that we have the right levers around pricing and also purchases to navigate the upcoming quarters. We feel very good about our supply chain position in terms of inventory levels for the short-term. As a reminder, at the end of last year, we stocked up in anticipation of two things a resurgence in customer demand, which we saw happening; and also a potential squeeze in some commodities that we were anticipating back then, which is proving true now. But we are very well positioned to drive that. So we will navigate the short-term supply-demand equation reasonably well, pulling on pricing levers as needed in our core. In addition to this, you have a mix effect from software rich revenues. These are coming from storage and of course, the Intelligent Edge. Aruba is performing extremely well. It\u2019s a very high gross margin business. We see continued growth in Aruba. We\u2019ve demonstrated three quarters of consecutive growth. This is set to continue. The products are in very hot demand everywhere globally. And the mix effect will also play on the gross margin front. I think I\u2019ve given you sufficient color there. So maybe it\u2019s time we turn to the cost optimization and resource allocation program. The bottom line on this one is we\u2019re on track and the reason why you see our operating margins up to the levels that you\u2019ve seen north of 11% overall for the company is because of that program. And so what\u2019s very, very important for us is that we keep that expense discipline to sustain this level of operating profit growth moving forward and drive productivity, meaning having higher revenue over the same cost base to continue to drive operating profit growth and, therefore, translating into free cash flow growth moving forward. The $800 million net run rate benefits, as a reminder, would be felt for the most part in fiscal year \u201821. You started seeing some of that. We\u2019re incurring restructuring costs to that effect. And the program will be over by fiscal year \u201822. And we\u2019re well on track, and I\u2019m very pleased with how it\u2019s tracking as we speak. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you. Antonio Neri : My other comment on the \u2013 sorry, Andy, my comment on what Tarek said, what we announced last year in Q2 was the right thing to do. It gave \u2013 we have enough experience in this company to tell us to take actions immediately and now proven to be very, very fruitful for us. As Tarek said in his remarks, right, we are becoming a different company, more leaner, more agile and allows us to prioritize investment in the areas of growth. So very pleased that we took that action at the time. Andrew Simanek : Yes, good point, Antonio. Thanks, Aaron, for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one please? Operator : And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. My congrats on the quarter as well. Question for Tarek, you beat the first quarter by about $0.11 versus consensus, you guided up the full year by $0.10. So the guidance implies that you don\u2019t operationally beat the next three quarters. Is that just prudence as we await full visibility into the pace of demand recovery? Or is that tied to some of the delayed OpEx investments that you mentioned? And maybe if you can detail what some of those investments are just so that we can understand what those are? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. So, we pretty much, Katy, passed on to the full year guidance the entire beat in Q1. A couple of points on the investment front, you could see from some of the slides that we put forward, our investment in R&D and FSC, this has to continue, and we\u2019ll find adequate sources to fund investments in FSCs and R&D because we have to continue to fuel growth. And this is part of our story, which is to rethink our cost structure in terms of back-office and front-of-house to drive growth and innovation by way of software. So I feel pretty good about that. With respect to also your modeling of EPS on a full year basis, I want to take the opportunity to highlight what\u2019s going on at the OI&E level. OI&E was a positive contributor to EPS in this quarter. This is just simply due to timing, particularly the contribution of economic interest from HPC. For the full year, we still see overall in OI&E $100 million expense. And this is why you may think that the guidance is flat H1 on H2. But don\u2019t forget the effect of OI&E coming in, in the second half of the year as an expense. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Katy for the question. Can we go to the next one, please? Operator : And our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. And I\u2019ll extend my congratulations as well. I wanted to talk a little bit on Aruba, fairly strong double-digit growth over here. And I think that\u2019s fairly impressive given peers like Cisco and Juniper are probably seeing low to mid single-digit growth. I know Silver Peak got some element to this. But I\u2019d love to get a sense from a share gain perspective, where are you seeing the share gains on the products and vertical side? Some color there would be helpful. And then the durability of this growth, that would be helpful to understand as well. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Amit. Well, listen, we believe Aruba is a winner, simply put. It is a software asset that delivers mobile-first class first experience that provides ubiquitous secure connectivity in a platform-oriented approach. So for us, it\u2019s not a surprise to see the momentum in that business, which is not just revenue as Tarek said three consecutive quarters of growth, but also five quarters of growth and margin expansion in that business. And as we commented early on, our SaaS revenue, which is the subscription to the platform is up three triple-digits, right, on that part of the business. We expect to gain both shares in campus switching and wireless LAN, whether is \u2013 we\u2019ll see how the market does. But some of our competitors don\u2019t disclose numbers. So it\u2019s hard to understand what was down versus up. But I think the market was not as positive as people portray, but we outperformed that market quite significantly. So whether it\u2019s 100 basis points, 200 basis points, all we see soon. But I\u2019ve remained very bullish. I remain very bullish about the business. This business will continue to grow for the balance of the year, also because now we have Silver Peak in our portfolio, which is a completely differentiated experience for the SD-WAN. And remember what I said early on, in an edge-to-cloud architecture, you have to connect all your edges and all your cloud. And the only way to do it at scale is through software. And Silver Peak brings a SaaS solution and also an on-prem solution that allows customers to connect all their edges on the cloud in a fully automated and autonomous way. And that\u2019s a big opportunity for us. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m really bullish because ultimately, we are integrating that solution into the same platform. And then there are multiple drivers of growth as we think about the next 12, 24, 36 months, which includes edge computing and 5G. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m very, very confident in our ability to deliver against that market. Andrew Simanek : Great, thank you. Thanks, Amit for the question. Can we go to the next one, please? Operator : And our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could help us understand where you see your market in terms of enterprises coming out of the pandemic or recovery? And really, the root of this question is Intelligent Edge looks like it\u2019s recovered with the year-over-year growth, whereas the other segments, maybe we can expect more of a recovery pattern later this year. So I\u2019m looking for maybe a bridge between what\u2019s execution and what\u2019s kind of macro recovery by segment. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. I mean, I think the market, in general, is recovering. As I said early on, Simon, is my point about the order linearity was steady and consistent throughout the quarter, which give us the confidence that we will see gradual continued improvement in that demand. And it\u2019s not one business. I think it\u2019s across all businesses. And I think it\u2019s a combination of our execution because of our strategy and the emphasis on the innovation that we bring to the market. And obviously, as the market gets better, we should take advantage of that, but remember, we have a unique value proposition. We are a company that has unique portfolio from edge-to-cloud. Our competitors don\u2019t have all of that. Some have in one area, some have in another area. And what customers want is an integrated experience more and more. And obviously, the shift to a consumption-driven model is in our favor because once we land a customer in GreenLake, basically, they get what they want, whether it\u2019s at the edge or what is in the core or whether it\u2019s in the managed services for the hybrid model that they are all adopting. So I think Compute, I think there are new technologies coming online with NVMe and more options that can be attached. Storage, obviously, is all the software-defined that Tarek talked about it. Data is exploding. And HPC, I\u2019m very bullish about HPC because ultimately, the data sets we see in customer sites continue to grow. And they all need AI machine learning at one point in time. Not just few customers. So whether it\u2019s large public sector, education also is going to be very good because we expect our children to get back to school at some point in time, obviously, transportation with autonomous vehicles and 5G deployments. So I see multiple growth going forward and obviously, it\u2019s in our hand to innovate and deliver against that opportunity. Tarek Robbiati : Antonio, if I can add color to compute business, I think it\u2019s important we let everyone on the call know, that when you look at the underlying performance of compute and particularly when you normalize for Q4 backlog impacts, both AUP and units were up sequentially. So there is a real recovery in Compute if you strip out the impact of backlog in Q4. AUP was up high single digits, and units were up approximately 10% quarter-on-quarter once you do that normalization. It\u2019s very hard for analysts outside the company to do the normalization, but that\u2019s why I wanted to make the point. So hopefully, that will resonate with the analyst community on this earnings announcement. Andrew Simanek : Yes. Thanks, Tarek and thank you, Simon for the question. So we are just about at the top of the hour now. Operator, can we have the last questions, please? Operator : And our last question today will come from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Paul Coster : Not a very exciting question to finish up on, but it looks like you\u2019re pushing the upper boundary of your expected operating margin range for the core businesses. And I\u2019m wondering \u2013 and it sounds like they could get better yet. So are you going to change the range of expectations around operating margins or is this just sort of unsustainable what we\u2019re seeing at the moment? Antonio Neri : Tarek, you want to take that? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, I will take it. Paul, this is a very exciting question. It\u2019s a very exciting question for me. It\u2019s essential. So don\u2019t be shy about it. I would simply say, look, we have to keep the expense discipline and drive productivity. We feel that the upper boundary has yet to be tested. And I would say that this is always, in a company like this, not a short-term endeavor, but something that has to be done on the sustainable business \u2013 on a sustainable basis moving forward. But remember also that what drives the operating margin is the continuous expansion into software. Margin risk software offerings and our ARR will start to shine as it continues to accelerate into fiscal year \u201821 and \u201822. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Paul, for the question. Antonio, maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to you for any final comments you have before we close the call. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Tarek, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I know there are more questions, but I know Tarek and the team will get off-line with you on the one-on-one follow-up calls. Now, I mean, I just want to reiterate this is a very solid start for our company for fiscal year \u201821. Obviously, we remain committed to driving shareholder value. I\u2019m particularly pleased with our results in profitability, in free cash flow, which was record-breaking. The fact that we are confident in the demand recovery and our own execution that allows us to raise guidance for the full year in both non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow, we see tremendous momentum in our areas of innovations and focus, Intelligent Edge and even HPC business, remember with our lumpiness of the business, confident to deliver that 8% to 12% growth and in the pivot to as-a-service. So because all of that, we believe this is going to be a good year in balance. And obviously, we\u2019re all watching the trends with the COVID. But I think customers realize that this is the year they need to make the investments to digitize everything in the company. So again, thank you for joining us today and I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. Talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you. And at this time, you may now disconnect.",

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found and posted to our website and is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. While great progress is made in the fight against COVID, it\u2019s also clear that it\u2019s still a global challenge. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the suffering occurring in India and elsewhere as communities confront devastating COVID surges. We will continue to do everything we can to support our team members, customers and communities through this very challenging time. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I\u2019ll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year \u201821. As usual, I\u2019ll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights for this quarter on slide 1, and now, let me discuss our financial performance, starting with slide 2. I am very pleased to report that our Q2 results reflect continued momentum in revenue, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation. We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 9% from the prior year period, a level better than our normal sequential seasonality. I am particularly proud of the fact that our non-GAAP gross margin is at the record level of 34.3%, up 210 basis points from the prior year period and up 60 basis points sequentially. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, cost takeouts and an ongoing favorable mix shift towards higher margin software-rich offering. Our non-GAAP operating expenses increased in the quarter, as we previously indicated, due to the planned hiring increases along with R&D and go-to-market investments. This offset by our continued progress delivering on the savings from our cost optimization plan, which is on track. Even with our investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 10.2%. That is up 300 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 59% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from onetime gains related to increased valuations in our Cohesity and IonQ investments within our Pathfinder venture portfolio. As a result, we now expect other income and expense for the full year in fiscal year \u201821 to be an expense of approximately $50 million. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.46, up 70% from the prior year and meaningfully above the higher end of our outlook range for Q2. Q2 cash flow from operations was $822 million and free cash flow was $368 million, up $770 million from the prior year, driven by better profitability and strong operational discipline as well as working capital benefits. This puts us at a record level of free cash flow for the first half at $931 million. Finally, we paid $156 million of dividends in the quarter and are declaring a Q3 dividend today of $0.12 per share, payable in July. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment highlights on slide 3. In Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our momentum with rich software capabilities to meet robust customer demand, delivering 17% year-over-year revenue growth across the portfolio. Switching was up 17% year-over-year, and wireless LAN was up 16%. Additionally, the Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up triple digits year-over-year and now represent a meaningful contribution to HPE\u2019s overall ARR. We also continued to see strong operating margins at 15.5% in Q2, up 320 basis points year-over-year, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion. Silver Peak continues to perform well, leveraging the high-growth SD-WAN market opportunity and contributed about 5 points to the Intelligent Edge top line growth. In HPC-MCS, revenue grew 11% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer acceptance milestones and deliver on our more than $2 billion of awarded contracts. We remain on track to deliver on our full year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. In compute, revenue grew 10% year-over-year and was down just 1% sequentially, reflecting much stronger than normal sequential seasonality. Operating margins were up meaningfully year-over-year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. We ended the quarter with an operating profit margin of 11.3%, up 550 basis points from the prior year period and towards the upper range of our long-term margin guidance for these segments provided at SAM. Within storage, revenue grew 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 17% with ongoing strong dHCI momentum growing triple digits. All-flash arrays grew 20% year-over-year, led by Primera that was up triple digits and is expected to surpass 3PAR sales next quarter. The mix shift towards our more software-rich platforms and operational execution helped drive storage operating profit margin to 16.8%, up 110 basis points year-over-year. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the second consecutive quarter year-over-year as reported with further growth expected for the full year of fiscal year \u201821. This has been driven by the increased focus of our BU segments on selling product and service bundles, improved service intensity and our growing as-a-service business, which I\u2019ll remind you, involves service attach rates of 100%. This is very, very important to note because all of our OS revenue is recurring with three-year average contract length, and OS is the highest operating margin contributor to our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was down 3% year-over-year as the pandemic did not materially impact this business until later in 2020. As expected, we are seeing continued sequential improvements in our bad debt loss ratios ending this quarter at just 75 basis points, which continues to be best-in-class within the industry. We have also seen improved cash collections well above pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin in this segment was 10.8%, up 160 basis points from the prior year and our return on equity at 18.3% is well above pre-pandemic levels and the 15%-plus target that we set at SAM. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. Similar to the past couple of quarters, we are making great strides in our as-a-service offering with over 90 new enterprise GreenLake customers added. That is in Q2, bringing the total to well over 1,000. I am pleased to report that our Q2 \u201821 ARR was $678 million, which was up 30% year-over-year, as reported. Total as-a-service orders were up 41% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in North America and Central Europe. Our Edge-as-a-Service offerings also continued to grow revenue strong triple digits year-over-year. Based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth targets of 30% to 40%, a CAGR from FY20 to FY23. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date where you can clearly see the strong rebound and momentum from our Q2 \u201820 trough. For the past two quarters, revenue has exceeded our normal sequential seasonality, reflecting the improving demand environment. And with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q2 by 70% year-over-year. Turning to slide 6. We delivered a record non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q2 of 34.3% of revenues, which was up 60 basis points sequentially and up 210 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline, operational services margin expansion from cost takeout and automation, and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses, like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offering. We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of fiscal year \u201820 that has given us much better visibility into each business unit and enabled better operational discipline. Moving to slide 7. You can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margin substantially from pandemic lows of -- to 10.2%, which is up 300 basis points from the prior year period. We have done this by driving further productivity benefits and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fuel our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. Q2 operating expenses also included planned increased hiring and spending on select investment to drive further growth. Turning to slide 8. We generated record first half levels of cash flow with $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and $931 million of free cash flow, which is up $1.5 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by the increased profitability, strong operational discipline and some in year timing-related benefits. I would like to underscore that this year, our free cash flow profile seasonality will be different as a result of our backend-loaded restructuring costs and investment in inventory for our supply chain to cater for rising demand and chip shortages as the economic recovery accelerates. Now, moving on to slide 9, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified balance sheet. As of April 30th quarter end, we have improved the operating company to a net cash neutral position with our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we have made good progress securitizing some financial services-related debt through the ABS market and expect to have close to all of the U.S. portfolio securitized by year-end. The refinancing of higher cost unsecured debt with ABS financing allows us to boost access to financing markets at a cheaper cost of debt capital as well as diversifying and segregating our balance sheet between our operating company and our financial services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensures we have ample liquidity available to run our operations, continue to invest in our business, drive growth and execute on our strategy. Now, turning to our outlook on slide 10. I am very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in the demand environment and our strong operational performance to date. This will be our third guidance increase in SAM in October 2020. We now expect to grow non-GAAP operating profit by 25% to 35% and deliver fiscal year \u201821 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.82 and $1.94. This is a $0.09 per share improvement at the midpoint of our prior EPS guidance of $1.70 to $1.88 and a $0.22 per share improvement at the midpoint since SAM. With respect to supply chain, we have executed well to date with minimal impact, and continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible. We do see further industry-wide tightening and inflation persisting in the near term, which has been factored in our outlook from both a revenue and cost perspective, but overall demand remains strong. From a top line perspective, we are pleased with the momentum we saw in the first half. And while we continue to see further demand improvement, we remain prudent as certain geographies continue to navigate the pandemic, and we continue to observe uncertainties in the supply of commodity. More specifically for Q3 \u201821, we expect revenue to be in line with our normal sequential seasonality of up low single digits from Q2. For Q3 \u201821, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.04 to $0.10 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 to $0.44. Additionally, given our record levels of cash flow in the first half and raised earnings outlook, I am very pleased to announce that we are also raising FY21 free cash flow guidance to $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. That is a $350 million increase at the midpoint from our original SAM guidance. So overall, Antonio and I are very proud of the progress we have made in the first half. We have navigated well through the pandemic and are exiting the first half with improved revenue momentum, strong profitability and robust cash flow. Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC-MCS have accelerated top line performance, our core business of compute and storage revenues are growing with improved margins, and our as-a-service ARR is accelerating. We also continue to execute well against our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which has made us leaner, better resourced and positioned to capitalize on the economic recovery currently at play. Now, with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator :  The first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. And congrats on another beat and full year free cash flow raise. I was wondering if you can dig a little bit more into the guidance dynamics. You\u2019re guiding 3Q a little bit below The Street, 4Q slightly higher. Can you maybe address what the visibility you have into 4Q is? And how much of supply chain impact are you baking in into 3Q, 4Q? Is that both the demand and the cost level? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Wamsi, hi. It\u2019s Tarek here. So, let me try and dissect the guidance we gave for Q3 and also the full year. So, putting things in perspective. First, you know we are raising our FY21 EPS outlook by $0.09 at the midpoint to $1.82 to $1.94 based on our Q2 outperformance. And we feel very confident for the rest of the year. This reflects what we see as continued improvement in customer spending, but also we want to remain prudent given the remaining pandemic and supply chain uncertainty. Specifically for Q3, it\u2019s important to note that we do expect revenue growth in line with normal FY18, FY19 sequential seasonality of up low single digits. We anchored you on FY18, FY19 and not last year because of the disruption we suffered in the supply chain last year. So, it\u2019s better to look at it from an FY18, FY19 viewpoint. You should expect that gross margins hold roughly flat relative to our H1 levels, near just under 34%. OpEx should be up somewhat as we continue to make select investments aligned to our strategy in key growth areas, and this is partially offset by further efficiencies we find. But most importantly, it is important that you note that OI&E will flip to an expense overall in the full year, and therefore, in the second half. OI&E in Q1 was a positive income and Q2 was a positive income. And now we\u2019re expecting for the full year \u201821 a $50 million expense, hence, the guidance that we\u2019re giving you overall for Q3. You can expect that the tax rate will be unchanged at 14%, like we said at SAM. And the net of all of this is that we expect our Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.44, and we feel pretty comfortable about it. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes. And thank you. I just wanted to ask your take on the forward guidance, which implies low-single-digit sequential growth following above seasonal quarter in the April quarter. It sounds like backlog continues to be strong. So, are there particular pockets of areas where you\u2019re seeing a slowdown or maybe more cautious outlook for -- from customers because they\u2019re still dealing with the pandemic issues? Antonio Neri : Maybe I\u2019ll start. I know Tarek has many comments. I mean, we see strong demand momentum right now. We quoted in our remarks that we\u2019re up mid-single-digits. And therefore, we translate that conversion into revenue. But obviously, part of the improvement could come from the HPC acceptances. Remember that on HPC, our order to revenue is a little bit more lumpy because of the time between orders and revenue takes longer. But overall, what we are confident is the fact that we see obviously IT demand improving. But I\u2019m really pleased with our innovation and our ability to execute against that innovation. The innovation we have across the portfolio is perfectly timed what we see in today\u2019s environment. We live in a much more distributed enterprise. Obviously, digital transformation is essential to operate in this digital economy, and the first step is connectivity. And I have to tell you, the Intelligent Edge business is absolutely incredibly strong. You saw in actual dollars, almost 20%. And we expect to continue to be super strong for the balance of the year into 2022, honestly. And that\u2019s because we have a business scale. We have a massive business scale. And to give a point of reference, we already have 100,000 customers on that platform. We have 150 customers every day. We manage more than 1.1 million devices. And honestly, we actually manage data of 1 billion plus per hour, data points that comes through our cloud. And so, we expect that to continue to be very strong. I think, the core business has definitely stabilized. And we see pockets of improvement, particularly with storage. And then, the as-a-service will continue to stay strong. Again, we are cautious about the supply chain aspect of this. But, we position ourselves well for the second half, and that was all factored in our guidance, absolutely well factored in our guidance. So, it\u2019s why we raised the guidance. Operator : Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. My congrats on the quarter as well. I want to come back, Tarek, to just reconciling the improving growth trajectory in all of your segments with the second half EPS guidance that assumes well below normal seasonality or about 40% of EPS coming in the back half versus past years. You typically have low to mid-50% second half EPS mix. I think, I heard you mention supply chain constraints and being cautious around that and COVID and general cost inflation, investments you\u2019re making and then OI&E dynamics. Can you just rank those -- well, first, did I forget any? And then, can you just rank those factors in terms of which are having the most impact on your back half EPS guidance? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Thank you, Katy. So, let me try and add a little bit more color to what we said already. So, first of all, remember, our cost optimization and allocation program. We exited FY20 very lean, and this has driven a very strong performance in Q1 at $0.52 per share. This is a level of earnings that was actually benefiting from the fact that we have a very strong run rate entering into Q1. In Q2, you saw that momentum continuing with the EPS that we posted at $0.46 per share. Very comfortable with the level of investments that we are making, and this is also showing in the gross and operating margin expansion that we\u2019ve demonstrated so far. So, now, when you also look at how this translates into free cash flow, obviously, we had a lot of free cash flow benefits into Q1, Q2 as a result of the earnings strength and which translated into free cash flow. But moving forward, what you have to factor into the guidance on earnings is the fact that there is some degree of uncertainty on supply chain. Although, as Antonio said, the demand is very strong across the board. The demand is very strong in Aruba. The demand is very strong in Compute. And you can see that with units going up year-over-year. And also in HPC-MCS, we are seeing the revenue trending in the range that we guided at SAM. This is all good. Having said that, we have also to reckon two other dynamics. Aside from the cost optimization program and the demand, the other dynamic is OI&E, which affects EPS in Q3 and Q4. Q1, Q2, we had two income quarters as far as OI&E is concerned. They\u2019ll flip into an expense of $50 million for the full year, gives you an order of magnitude of what would be the EPS for each one of Q3, Q4. And then, on free cash flow, the other final element that drives it is we have to deal with supply chain, and we continue to buffer inventory to be ready for the demand in fiscal year \u201821 for the second half, but also fiscal year \u201822. We do not expect that the situation on inventory is going to be all of a sudden setting up across the world and across the industries, and we\u2019ve taken steps, and we\u2019ll continue to do so. So overall, we\u2019re managing, I would say, the resurgent demand environment very well. We\u2019re lean from an organization standpoint. Our earnings power is shown by the margins we\u2019re posting. And also, you could see that what we\u2019re doing on free cash flow, we\u2019re doing very, very well. So hopefully, that gives you a color to your questions with the rankings of the various effects at play. Antonio Neri : Katy, this is Antonio. I just want to reinforce a couple of things. I understand the normal sequential seasonality, people trying to get into it. But the fact of the matter is, we are delivering record-breaking gross margin. We are raising our EPS guidance despite the supply chain uncertainty. And our business is in huge demand. And it\u2019s not just the IT demand, it\u2019s the fact that we have unique portfolio, edge-to-cloud, that\u2019s meeting the customer needs of today and future ready for tomorrow. And so, I think the fact is that when you look at the full year, right, we have raised guidance now 3 times. And to Tarek\u2019s point, it\u2019s more than 25% from the beginning of the year. And that\u2019s a testament of the momentum we have in the business. Then obviously, every quarter has ups and downs because of unique things like OI&E or maybe more inventory buildout. But in the end, the takeaway is that we are raising again the EPS for the full year and free cash flow. Operator : Our next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle McNealy : I wanted to see if you could give us a sense for the position of your compute installed base. We saw F5 had stronger than expected upgrade activity to hardware systems coming out of the worst days of COVID impact. For you guys, how high is the average age of your compute installed base versus normal levels? And are you seeing any upgrade activity start to come through now for on-premise hardware after COVID-related delays last year? Antonio Neri : Well, sure. Obviously, we are one of the market leaders today in terms of whatever you look at, revenue, market share. But obviously, our portfolio, which is ProLiant is on the 23 years in the making and our installed base is incredibly large. The average is probably between four, five years, Kyle, at this point in time. Definitely, it\u2019s a pent-up demand to modernize that infrastructure. But, it\u2019s not just replacing hardware for the sake of replacing hardware. It\u2019s to really bring that cloud experience to our computer source and more and more be able to consume it elastically as-a-service. And that\u2019s the unique value proposition we have, which is not only just the best infrastructure with ProLiant as a franchise, but the fact that we have a provisional life cycle management. And you should stay tuned for more announcement here shortly, but also be able to pivot that installed base to more a consumption base over time, and then more and more as a well to optimize solutions. And remember, these platforms come also in a different structure in the sense that you have more options and more technologies built into the platform. And so, for us, it\u2019s a big opportunity. And I think an accelerator of that transition is our GreenLake business. It\u2019s not just replacing the old infrastructure or the CapEx but be able to and repatriate workloads on-prem where it makes sense, or actually hold workloads on-prem because now we can deliver a true cloud experience in our consumption-driven model. Tarek Robbiati : And let me add to this, Kyle. There\u2019s also another aspect that we see the pent-up demand and really the need to modernize the infrastructure and the way the infrastructure is used. But also, if the decision to actually modernize the infrastructure and moving to consumption isn\u2019t made, it\u2019s not bad for us, because we benefit from extended leasing with our financial services portfolio, which has been doing extremely well with our asset management business as people tend to use the infrastructure more, absent a decision or an availability of supply for the equipment they want to use. So, it\u2019s good for us on all fronts. And we\u2019re very happy with that performance on both, the core compute business and HPFS. Antonio Neri : And last but not least, let\u2019s not forget just the hardware is the operational services that come with it, because every upgrade cycle, whether it\u2019s the traditional way or as-a-service, obviously, as-a-service is even better because it comes with 100% attach of Pointnext OS. We have seen richer configurations and higher services attached. And that\u2019s why part of the gross margin expansion you saw in Q2, in compute, which was 550 basis points, comes also after the fact we are attaching more services to our infrastructure. Operator : Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the quarter and the raised guide. One of the things that comes up obviously is your asset, H3C. I\u2019m just curious any updated thoughts on how you are thinking about that put optionality, which I believe expires in early \u201822. And how are you thinking about kind of the use of capital? Any kind of thoughts on more flexibility on M&A or any strategic thoughts on that front? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, I will start and then Tarek will comment. Listen, we still have roughly a year to make the decision. The put expire in May 2022. Let me remind everybody that obviously China is the second largest IT market and growing. And our setup is unique, is unique in many ways to fulfill the needs of a unique market like China. And I think that joint venture with the partner has been incredibly successful driving shareholder values through H3C level and also through us, right, because obviously, we collect dividends from that joint venture. But it\u2019s a way to reach a market that\u2019s very hard to compete. So, we will continue to relate what is the best use of that capital in the context of participating in China, and we decided to take action what to do with our capital. But right now, we have not decided one way or the other one. We continue to explore what is the best return for shareholders and also to position the Company for growth as we think about the future. I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you have any comments? Tarek Robbiati : You said very well, Antonio. We have time to make the decision. The put expires in April 2022. So, we have a little bit less than a year, and that is to sell all or part of our 49% stake in units. We feel that this is a stake that continues to accreting value. Just to put things in perspective for everyone on the call, in fiscal year \u201820 alone, the equity interest contribution from H3C grew over 20% to $212 million for fiscal year \u201820. We expect that growth to continue, and therefore, the value of our stake to continue to accrete. Operator : Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I was just going to ask about acquisitions in general and your M&A thoughts. It\u2019s been about a year since Silver Peak, a couple of years since MapR. Just I know you\u2019ve made some small acquisitions in the interim, but I\u2019m wondering with the liquidity position you have, the cash flow and your approach to growth where you\u2019re at and what you might think are some holes in your portfolio? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. No, thank you. Obviously, M&A is an important component of our strategy. And as we have done, at least I have done now probably 19 of them, has always has been about, obviously, very stringent return on invested capital, very disciplined in that approach. But it\u2019s always about bringing intellectual property and talent to accelerate our edge-to-cloud platform vision. Silver Peak was completed in September last year and now fully integrated into our business and now we start seeing the momentum in our Intelligent Edge business, and all the ones we are doing along the way, particularly around data and software-defined assets and so forth. So, again, we continue to evaluate what is available there, notwithstanding the fact that we have to be incredibly disciplined. As you know, valuation seems to be a little bit too high for some of the assets. But again, if there is something out there that makes sense, we will evaluate it, and we will take the right action. But again, it\u2019s an important component of our strategy going forward. And I always we talk about the Aruba-like type of things. But we evaluate everything, whatever is relevant for our strategy. I don\u2019t know, Tarek, if you have any comments on that. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Shannon, I mean, it\u2019s very important to maintain discipline and focus in the content -- in a context where valuations in some cases, particularly for some class of assets, a little bit exuberant. But, if we can find two to three Silver Peak type of acquisitions, I don\u2019t think Antonio and I will hesitate a second to just go and press the button. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. And thanks for taking my question. I guess, I was hoping if you could talk more about the Intelligent Edge performance. The 17% growth, I think, is more impressive, better than what most of your peers have had on the networking side, other than Arista maybe. So, maybe you can just talk about what is driving the inflection of growth over here? And what is the durability of the double-digit growth really as we go into the back half and beyond? That would be really helpful. And then, if I could ask you to clarify this, because I may have missed it completely. Why is OI&E flipping from positive in the first half to negative in such a big way in the back half? Antonio Neri : Sure. I will start, and Tarek will talk about the OI&E. I mean, obviously, if you look about the way we operate and the growth in IoT and the need for connectivity, obviously, is continuing to grow. Interesting enough, three years ago, I said that the enterprise of the future will be edge-centric, cloud-enabled and data-driven. And it\u2019s played exactly that way. Unfortunately, through the COVID pandemic, we saw that acceleration. But, when you think about digital transformation, right, obviously, we live in a digital economy. And the first step is to be connected. If you\u2019re not connected, you\u2019re not participating. That connectivity is not just any more users and devices as things -- everything is connected to the network, everything computes, everything generates data. And so, connectivity is at the forefront of the digital transformation. And obviously, remote working is requiring the need for Wi-Fi connectivity to a level we haven\u2019t seen before. But, that\u2019s an example of what\u2019s happening out there. But, I will say, our innovation with a true cloud-native platform at massive scale. And again, the fact that we already have 100,000 customers, and we\u2019re adding 150 customers every day, that tells you the value proposition resonated. We can provision a WAN port, a LAN port or a Wi-Fi port or a BLE or Zigbee, whatever is the amount protocol from the cloud. And we\u2019re able to do that in an intelligent and autonomous way. Because ultimately, it\u2019s about the data you collect and what experiences you can provide. And so, we believe this is absolutely durable. We are very bullish about this business. We expect this business to continue to grow double digits for the balance of the year. And as we add more functionality by cloud platform, particularly with edge computing and 5G, we are going to accelerate that momentum. And when you talk to customers and partners, they love the Aruba experience, absolutely love the simplicity, they love the fact that you improve their experience for their own business, and then powers this new way to work. So, that\u2019s why we are pretty excited. And the other thing is that the platform that Aruba runs the cloud is not the platform we run the rest of the Company. When we deploy now one of the data services through the new announcements we made on May 4th, or where we deploy compute or we deploy a workload-optimized is running on the same backend that Aruba was originally created. And that\u2019s why we have a true edge-to-cloud platform. And then, we lay on top of that the as-a-service model, whether it\u2019s subscription and software, which is growing triple digit in Aruba or whether it\u2019s the as-a-service model with GreenLake. And that\u2019s the unique differentiation we have in the marketplace. And that\u2019s why we feel very good about the growth prospect of this business. Tarek, on the OI&E? Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Thank you, Antonio. On the OI&E front, thanks for asking the question as to why we expect OI&E to flip into a negative in the second half. In OI&E, you have effectively three effects. The first one is the H3C economic contribution and the timing of which shifts between quarters, while like we said before, very happy with H3C and the economic interest that we have through them and the cash they return to us on a regular basis. So, it\u2019s a timing element there for H3C. There is also interest expense that is the second force in the OI&E line. And then, the third force is the Pathfinder portfolio, our venture portfolio, which has been doing extremely well in the first half, and we did flag this in my script. We said we had benefits from revaluations of our investment in Cohesity and IonQ. We had, in the first quarter in OI&E $16 million income in the second quarter, a $27 million income. This is on an aggregate basis across the three forces. So, for the first half, $43 million of OI&E income, and we\u2019re guiding for the full year for an expense of $50 million. So that\u2019s a $90 million swing. And that $90 million swing, if you turn it into an EPS number, divide that to do the math yourself, it\u2019s about $0.07 to $0.08 of EPS for the full year, right? That\u2019s the thing you have to reckon when you compute your Q3 or Q4 EPS forecast. That\u2019s the swing factor there. It does not change the fact that our operating performance remains very, very solid. The swing factor at the OI&E level is explaining a little bit more hopefully the guidance for all of you on the call. Antonio Neri : And I will say again, despite all of that, we have raised the guidance. Operator : Our final question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on solid results and cash flow. My question is on the HPC business. I had expected that that business to grow sequentially, especially after a slowdown in Q1. Maybe it\u2019s just normal seasonality, but understand the businesses could be lumpy. Are there any trends that you can draw from the last two quarters? Whether deals are taking longer to close or being accepted by customers? And more broadly, what gives you confidence that you can hit your 8% to 12% growth target? Maybe you can talk about what\u2019s the normal seasonality for that business in fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4. Thanks. Antonio Neri : Let me start. I\u2019m going to talk more for the market. Tarek can talk more on the financial side. Listen, the bookings momentum is incredibly strong in this business. So, you have to look at the booking side and then you have to look at the revenue side. The bookings continue to be just amazing. And I quote some of the deals we won. These are multimillion dollar deals. Seasonality in this business doesn\u2019t really play out that well because the fact of the matter is that you have these large systems that need to be built, shipped, installed, you have to run the workload. And then, only then when the customer accepts the system with the workload running, you can recognize revenue. And that time can vary. It can be as quick as three months, as long as a year in some cases, especially when you deploy these massive exascale systems, which we\u2019re going to do starting end of the year and then next year in 2022. And sometimes you need to run the workload for a month. But reinstalling the system from the factory on the floor, sometimes can take up to 60 days. It\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a size of football field. So, I would not think about the seasonality. I think about the long-term growth of the business, we feel pretty good and confident about that CAGR. But, even this year, we believe we\u2019re going to deliver the 8% to 12% growth just this year in 2021, right? So, this is about keeping the orders book momentum, short term, the life cycle of the supply chain and install and acceptance as much as we can. And then, this business is a lot of softer, right, that gets built around the system itself. So, that\u2019s why we\u2019re very bullish about this system and this business. And remember, it\u2019s all on the back of the day. That\u2019s why we talk about AI and deep learning technologies, data continue to grow exponentially, and you need more compute. That\u2019s a fact at the level you haven\u2019t seen before. Tarek, maybe you want to comment on the... Tarek Robbiati : Yes. You said it very well, Antonio. We simply say, look, the order momentum remains very, very strong. It was up double digits in Q2. We have a large awarded order book with over $2 billion of contracts. The pipeline that we are having in mind includes another $5 billion of exascale opportunity to be awarded over the next three years. The win rates that we observe are very high. We win five out of six contracts in the exascale space. It\u2019s an inherently lumpy business. So, I think if you look at it on a quarterly basis, probably not the best picture. You have to look at it on a multiyear basis. And we feel very confident that we can achieve the 8% to 12% CAGR per year, including starting this year fiscal year \u201821. And because of the lumpiness of the revenue, you also have lumpiness in profitability as a result of the revenue profile and the product mix that doesn\u2019t worry us at all. It\u2019s the nature of the beast, so to speak. We feel that HPC-MCS is extremely well positioned as a business segment, to continue to be a very strong tractor of growth for HPE overall. Antonio Neri : And that growth will continue, which, as I said earlier, right, today, the HPC at the edge already represents 22% of the Company\u2019s revenue. And as we go forward with both businesses growing double digits, that 22% will be bigger at the different margin than the core, right? So, anyway, I know we are running out of time. Just to close, I\u2019m very pleased with HPE\u2019s Q2 results that again, they are marked by strong revenue momentum, profitability and free cash flow. The overall demand is improving, but our execution, our innovation is perfectly timed to the customer needs that we see in the marketplace. And despite there is supply chain uncertainty around specific commodities, we factor all that in, in our ability to execute to the back half, and that\u2019s why we are raising once again for the third time in the year, our EPS and free cash flow. And I believe the future is edge-to-cloud, and it\u2019s going to be consumption-based. Well I think HP has a unique value proposition and set of offerings. And that\u2019s why I believe this is a very exciting time for HPE. We have worked really hard, despite the pandemic. Our team has been incredibly resilient. And this Company has a clear purpose to advance the way people live and work. And despite the challenges, we continue to support the communities we are in. So, again, thank you again for joining the call today. And I hope you continue to stay safe and healthy. And talk to you soon. Andrew Simanek : Thanks, everyone, operator. I think we can go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. I am amazed by the resilience of our customers, partners, and team members. And I'm incredibly proud of the way Hewlett Packard Enterprise continues to serve the needs of our global communities during such unusual and evolving circumstances. We delivered a very impressive third quarter at the HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins, and record-free cash flows. Overall, I am pleased to see how our differentiated portfolio is resonating with the market. And our age to close strategy is driving improved momentum across our businesses. Based on the strength of our Q3 performance, and our confidence about our momentum in the market, we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 EPS and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases. Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality. Our Q3 orders were up against strong double-digits year-over-year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our age to cloud offerings. We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share up 28% and 27% year-over-year, respectively. We generated a record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up to $1.1 billion year-over-year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October.  I am particularly pleased that we were able to deliver these results while mitigating against industry-wide supply constraints by taking proactive inventory measures, working closely with our suppliers, and deployed our best-in-class engineering capabilities to establish specific response plans. The impact of the pandemic continued to accelerate the shift we predict two years ago, to an edgecentric, cloud-enabled, and data-driven world. Now, more than ever, there is a greater need for secure connectivity, faster insights from data, and a cloud experience everywhere. We expect these trends to continue.  Digital transformation is no longer a priority, but a strategic imperative. To help our customers transform their businesses and be future-ready today, we have been focused on doubling down in key areas that are resonating strongly in the market. We had a record number of orders in both our Intelligent Edge business and high-performance computed and mission-critical solutions business. Due to strong demand and execution, these growth businesses now make up nearly 25% of our total Company revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3 with 23% year-over-year revenue growth driven by a record number of new orders.  From customer demands for secure connectivity have generated a backlog five times greater than at the close of Q3 last year. As customers increasingly look for solutions to collect, connect, analyze and act on data at the Edge. We are leaning into this demand and continue to invest in innovated the edge. In June, we announced new AI ops, IoT, and security features for our Aruba Edge Services Platform or ESP, designed to streamline network operations, maximize IP efficiency, and more easily extend the network from the Edge to the cloud. Our Aruba ESP continues to gain traction with customers in different verticals.  In the Third Quarter, customers including Save a Lot, Monument Health, and Circa Resorts and Casinos, all standardized their networks on Aruba ESP. In our High-Performance Computer & Mission, Critical solutions business revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by a record number of new orders. We also generate our record order book, which now exceeds $2.5 billion. The exponential growth in data, along with AI and big data analytics all driving an increased need for high-performance computing and mission-critical capabilities in enterprises of all sizes.  To meet this demand, we bolstered our artificial intelligence capabilities with the acquisition of determined AI, our stepped-up that delivers a powerful software stack that trains AI mobiles faster at any scale using its open-source machine learning platform. We also continue to see an increasing number of customers accessing our high-performance computer solutions as a service through HPE GreenLake. With our HPE GreenLake cloud services for HPC, customers gained powerful, specialized, computed, and AI capabilities with a sustainable cloud experience. For example, in Q3, HP was awarded a $2 billion contract to be realized over a 10-year period with the National Security Agency to deliver high-performance computing solutions through the HP Greenlake platform.  The service will help the National Security Agency efficiently process data and allot new insight in sustainable new ways. Our core businesses generator robust year-over-year orders growth, as well as strong profitability and free cash flow in the quarter. Year-to-date, computer storage orders are up mid-single-digits. With Q3 operating margins of 11.2% and 15.1% respectively. We continue to offer more of our core capabilities as-a-Service. In Q3, we introduced unified compute operations as-a-Service throughout HP Greenlake age-to-cloud platform. This new cloud-based management service simplifies provisioning and automates the management of computer infrastructure wherever it resides.  Our storage business is transforming into a cloud-native Software-Defined Data Services business through organic innovation and targeted acquisitions. In May, we introduced our new cloud data services available through HPE Greenlake, as well as our new HPE Letra cloud-native data infrastructure. And just this week, we closed the acquisition of Zerto, an industry leader in cloud data management and protection, and ran some way of data recovery services, which will be soon available as a service through HPE GreenLake.  With these acquisitions, immediate repositions, HPE GreenLake is a high-growth data protection market with a proven scaled solution. HPE was the first to market 4 years ago in delivering announcer Service, Cloud expedience on-premises in our co-location or at the Edge with HPE Greenlake. Today, our HPE GreenLake is to cloud platform, has more than 1,100 customers. Our annualized revenue run rate this quarter was $705 million, up 33% year-over-year. Driven by strong as-a-service orbits growth, up 46% year-over-year.  Organizations across sectors, including retail, healthcare, financial services, and the public sector, are turning to HP Greenlake. For instance, we helped Liberty Mutual shift from a traditional CAPEX IT spend to a new pay-as-you-go model, creating a cloud experience on-premises to provide transparency into consumption while improving their speed in adapting to capacity demands. They standardized critical workloads on HP Synergy, delivered through HP Greenlake, resulting in a reduced data center footprint and significant cost savings, including a monthly unit rate well below public cloud alternatives.  We also see in the power of the full HPE age-to-cloud portfolio as customers are turning to HPE for integrated solutions, a combined secure connectivity data insight capability, and cloud experiences. Woolworths Group, Australia and New Zealand's largest retailer selected HPE GreenLake to power its new Wpay payment platform. They needed a solution that combined a powerful mission-critical architecture, with the ability to scale and also provided better cost efficiency back to Wpay and its Merchants Partners. Delivered through HPE GreenLake, their solution leverages our full age-to-cloud portfolio, including HP Aruba, HPE NonStop, HPE Primera, and HPE Synergy.  HPE Pointnext services also provided expertise to us over the Company's digital transformation. I believe this is a great example of the power of our HPE supply portfolio. To extend our leadership position in cloud services and further accelerate our pivot to as-a-service, we are relentlessly . We made several compelling announcements at HPE Discover in June. I am particularly excited about our new HPE GreenLake lighthouse offering. A secure cloud-native stack built with HPE Ezmeral software to autonomously optimize different workloads across the hybrid state, reducing time to deployment, and operating costs. We also introduced Project Aurora, to secure the enterprise. Embedded in our HPE GreenLake aids to cloud platform Project Aurora automatically, and continuously verifies an attack. The integrity of the hardware, freeware, operating systems, platforms, and workloads, while also detecting advanced trends. And finally, demonstrating our continued commitment to our  assets that complement our own capabilities, we acquired a data platform developer, Ampool. Ampool will accelerate the HP Ezmeral analytics run-time, to deliver high-performance analytics for engineers and business analysts. I am proud of HP's performance in Q3 and year-to-date. And the significant progress we have made in becoming the edge cloud Company.  The momentum we have in the market compels us to move even further and faster. And our ability to transform with increasing speed is imperative. Transformation is my number one priority. At this pivotal moment, our purpose to advance the way people live and work has never been more important. Our vision to become the edge to cloud Company is  its tremendous relevance. And our portfolio is winning in the marketplace. Fueled by our purpose, vision, and portfolio, we have the opportunity to build a more discipline-enabled inclusive work.  We have a mandate to imagine new digital transformation strategies that support our own ESG goals and those of our customers, leading to better business outcomes and societal impact. We will never waiver from our commitment to being a force for good, and a strategic partner for our customers. We will continue to bring both new innovations to our customers, and we will continue to create value for our shareholders, and I'm grateful for the incredible team and I'm confident in and excited about the future. I hope you will join us for our virtual security analyst meeting on October 28, to hear more about our position in the market, our priorities, and our outlook for the year ahead. I will now turn it over to Tarek. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slides 1 and 2. So now, let me discuss our Q3 performance starting with Slide 3. I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing very strong demand across all of our businesses. Q3 was marked by accelerating order growth, strong gross and operating margin expansion, and robust cash flow generation. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter. And in line with normal sequential seasonality. Also, in line with our outlook that factored in summer off of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged. We are working to ensure disruption is minimal by taking proactive measures and coordinating with our world-class suppliers to establish tailored recovery plans. I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially, and up 420 basis points from the prior-year period. This is driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards the higher-margin, software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline, and cost takeout. As previously indicated, we continue to invest in high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio, both in R&D and go-to-market, particularly in Aruba software and as-a-Service, which increased our non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter.  We also booked two one-time charges in total $28 million for a legal settlement and bad debt associated with likely fraud, involving a channel partner in APJ. Even with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit. We continue to be focused on driving further efficiencies in the business. Within other income and expenses, we benefited from stronger operational performance in HPC and strong gains related to increasing valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio.  As a result, we now expect other income and expenses for fiscal year '21 to be an income of approximately 50 million. With strong execution across the business and despite 2 unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $526 million. This puts us at the record $1.5 billion of year-to-date free cash flow, up 1.1 billion from the prior year, driven primarily by an increase in operating profit. Finally, the strength of our business has positioned us to contribute substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the quarter, and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. We are also announcing today the resumption of share buybacks as a result of greater free cash flow generation and visibility. I'll come back to capital allocation more broadly when we discuss the outlook. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total Company revenue, are executing strongly and experiencing record order levels. In the Intelligent Edge, we accelerated our topline momentum with record levels of orders, and 23% year-over-year revenue growth. Switching was up over 20% year-over-year, whereas wireless LAN experienced more acute supply constraints and was up mid-single-digits.  Additionally, the Edge as a Service offering was up triple-digits year-over-year, which reflects enabling software platforms, as well as network-as-a-service. We also continue to see strong operating margins at 15.8% in Q3, up 540 basis points year-over-year, which included 17 million one-time legal settlements that impacted margins by 2 points. continues to perform strongly and contributed 7 points to the Intelligent Edge growth. In addition, we started generating meaningful revenue synergies by cross-selling the Aruba portfolio, which reinforces the merits of the Silver Peak deal.  In HPC & MCS, demand strengthened even further with a record order level. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year as we continue to achieve more customer accepting milestones and deliver on more than $2.5 billion of awarded contracts, including the contract that Antonio mentioned with the NSA worth $2 billion over 10 years. We remain on track to deliver on our full-year and three-year revenue growth CAGR target of 8% to 12%. In Compute, revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting normal sequential seasonality despite previously anticipated supply chain tightness. operating margins of 11.2% were up 190 basis points from the prior year, due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment.  Within storage, revenue grew 1% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth and software-defined offerings. Nimble grew 10% year-over-year with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double-digits year-over-year. All-flash Arrays grew by over 30% year-over-year, led by Primera. The mix shift towards more software-rich platforms helped to drive storage operating margins to 15.1%, up 10 basis points year-over-year, offset by continued investments in our cloud data services. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter, year-over-year as reported with both order and revenue growth expected for fiscal year '21.  Within HPE Financial Services, revenue was flat year-over-year and sequentially, while our bad net loss ratio did increase slightly to 94 basis points this quarter, it was entirely due to a one-time 11 million reserve charge related to the already mentioned likely fraud in APJ by a channel partner. Optioned for this one-off event, our bad debt loss ratio would have improved to just 61 basis points, aligned to pre-pandemic levels. More importantly, we continue to see improved cash collections above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin was 11.1% up 300 basis points from the prior year, and our Return on Equity at 18.3%, is well above the 15% plus target set at SAM.  Slide 5 highlights the key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We have made significant progress since our Analyst Day last October by adding over 200 new enterprises, Greenlake customers, to over 1,100 today. And increasing our TCV by over $1 billion to our current lifetime TCV of well over $5 billion. For Q3, specifically, our ARR was $705 million, which was up 33% year-over-year, as reported and total as-a-Service orders were up 46% year-over-year. It is also important to note that the mix of our ARR is becoming more and more software-rich, as we build out our Greenlake cloud platform, which is improving our margin profile.  We look forward to providing more disclosure around our software and services mix at our Analyst Day later this fall, which I believe reinforces a significant value-add of Greenlake. Overall, based on strong customer demand and recent wins, I am very happy with how this business is executing and progressing towards achieving our ARR growth target of 30% to 40% CAGR from FY20 to FY23. Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance to date, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year, and sustained momentum for the last 3 quarters. The demand environment continues to strengthen, and with the operational execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we have increased non-GAAP EPS in Q3 by 31% year-over-year. Turning to Slide 7, we delivered another record, non-GAAP gross margin rate in Q3 of 34.7% of revenues, which was up 40 basis points sequentially, and up 420 basis points on the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses like the Intelligent Edge and next-generation storage offerings. We have also benefited from the new segmentation we implemented beginning of the fiscal year 2020. That gives us much better visibility into each business unit and enables a better resource allocation and discipline to drive operating leverage.  Moving to Slide 8, you can also see we have expanded non-GAAP operating profit margins substantially from pandemic lows to 9.8%, which is up 190 basis points from the prior-year period. We are driving further productivity benefits, and delivering the expected savings from our cost optimization plan, while simultaneously increasing our investment levels in R&D and field selling costs, which are critical to fueling our long-term innovation engine and revenue growth targets. As mentioned previously, Q3 operating expenses also included one-time charges not included in our guidance, totaling $28 million for a legal settlement, and the likely fraud scheme involving a partner.  Excluding these one-off charges, our operating margin would have been 10.2%. Turning to slide 9, we generated record year-to-date levels of cash flow with $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.5 billion of free cash flow, which is up to $1.1 billion year-over-year. This was primarily driven by increased operating profit. I would like also to underscore that this year, our free cash flow seasonality will be different than in prior years. We expect increased financial services volume that includes more than $150 million in Q4 financing for a very large deal that is predominantly Greenlake and will benefit our ARR and margins for years to come.  We also have further restructured payments, and growing working capital needs as we continue to buffer our inventory levels in the light of the disruption in the global IT supply chain. Now moving on to Slide 10, let me remind everyone about the strength of our diversified Balance Sheet. As of July 31st, the Operating Company's net cash balance turned positive due to our strong free cash flow. Furthermore, we made additional progress during the quarter securitizing over $750 million of financial services-related debt through the ABS market.  The refinancing of higher costs unsecured debt with ABS financing, allows us to boost access to the financing market at a cheaper cost of debt capital, as well as diversify and segregate our Balance Sheet between our operating Company and our financial services business. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity to our operations, continuing to invest in our business to drive growth and return capital to shareholders.  Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 11, I'm very pleased to announce that we are once again raising our full-year guidance to reflect the continued momentum in a demanding environment and our strong execution. This will be the fourth guidance increase since SAM in October 2020, we now expect to deliver fiscal year '21 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share between $1.88 and $1.96. With respect to supply chain, as indicated last quarter, industry-wide tightening somewhat constrained our supply as expected. We continue to take proactive inventory measures where possible.  And you can see our efforts in inventory balances that increased $1.3 billion year-to-date, which also reflects the strengthening demand environment and a substantial order book we have across the business. We expect the challenge supply chain conditions to persist until at least the middle of the calendar year 2022, and have factored these into our revenues, costs, and cash flow outlook. From a top-line perspective, although we remain prudent, given the chance supply chain environment, we are very pleased with the accelerating Q3 order momentum across all segments of the business. More specifically, for Q4 '21, we expect revenue to be above our normal sequential seasonality from Q3 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. For Q4 '21, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.14 to $0.22 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. Additionally, given our record levels, our free cash flow year-to-date, and confidence in our raised outlook, I'm very pleased to announce that we are also raising fiscal year '21 free cash flow guidance from $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. That is a $600 million increase at the midpoint from our original sand guidance with the top end of this free cash flow guidance range at the peak levels attained in fiscal year '19.  As you recall, at the end of the first half of the fiscal year 2020, we suspended our share buybacks to preserve liquidity in the context of the global pandemic disruption. Although we continue to operate in a challenging supply environment, our order momentum and improved cash flow generation visibility give us the confidence to reinstate our share repurchase program. We are targeting up to $250 million of share repurchases in Q4 of fiscal year '21 and will update investors on our capital management policy for fiscal year '22 at SAM in October. As a reminder, we always follow a disciplined return-based capital allocation framework to maximize long-term shareholder value.  Our number one priority remains to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, through both organic and inorganic M&A investments while remaining committed to paying dividends to our shareholders. In addition, we will consider opportunistic share buybacks when we see a favorable return for doing so. So overall, and to conclude, I am very proud of the progress we have made year-to-date in fiscal year 21. It's clear that our Edge-to-Cloud strategy is resonating with customers, and driving improved momentum across all of our businesses.  Our growth businesses in the Intelligent Edge and HPC MCS have accelerated top-line performance with record levels of orders. Our core business of Compute and storage is demonstrating momentum with robust orders and improved margins, and our as-a-Service ARR is accelerating. All of this translates to improving revenue momentum, strong profitability growth, and record levels of free cash flow. We look forward to closing out our fiscal year much leaner, better resourced, and positioned to capitalize on the strong demand environment.  Lastly, as Antonio mentioned, we look forward to having you join us for our virtual Securities Analyst Meeting in late October, where we will provide an update on our strategy, business insights, and financial outlook. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . We also request that you only ask one question. The first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please, go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I guess the questions really around the free cash flow generation. I think you're implying based on the rates free cash flow guide, that we'll do around a 100 million or so free cash flow in Q4, which I think will be one of the softest .  Maybe just quantify some of the dynamics that are at play that's driving that power, have you talked about a few of them, but just quantify the headwind there. And secondly, the focus  to this $2 billion in cash number longer-term. Maybe touches on what are the key levers to get to the $2 billion number, and how much of that is self-help versus revenue-driven? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. Thank you, Amit for the question. Yes, our free cash flow for Q4 is north of 100 million, it's actually implied in our guidance about 150 million in Q4. And this figure reflects a different seasonal profile that we have had this year in terms of our revenue and expense profile, but also a couple of very important dynamics that I would like to underscore.  First of all, we have to continue to make investments in our inventory level to withstand the supply chain constraints that we flagged for several quarters now. Second, in Q4 of fiscal year '21, in my script, I described a very, very large Greenlake deal that will impact free cash flow in Q4, but that will generate substantial ARR revenue in subsequent quarters. This is a deal in several $100 million that we have not announced yet, but it is already something that we're financing. And this is affecting therefore free cash flow already as of Q4 of fiscal year '21. Thirdly, we are still peaking on restructuring costs in fiscal year '21 and we feel very positive about our cost optimization and resource allocation program, which will wind down at the end of fiscal year '22.  And so this is a nice segue to tell you about our guidance towards fiscal year '22 and the 2 billion targets that we have. We continue to expect revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the momentum that carries out of fiscal year '21, and also the restructuring cost program winding down will be a key determinant of our generation of free cash flow in fiscal year '22. So hopefully I gave you color there. Does Antonio want to add something? Antonio Neri : No, the only thing I will say maybe is that listen, Tarek made this comment in his remarks, is the fact of the matter on the high-end -- on the top end of that balance we give you 1.7 billion, is almost the same number we achieved in 2020 -- 2019.  And therefore, in many ways, we are almost a year ahead of our commitment because if you'll recall, we said we're going to return to normalized free cash flow in 2022. In the reality, even when you finance these large deals that eventually we're going to communicate has nothing to do with the NSA deal.  We are already almost at the same number, so that's why we are so pleased with the momentum that we have. But it's a momentum based on the order growth, and all the actions we have taken, and the deliberate shift in our portfolio to higher margins. And that's what you see in our numbers in Q3, right? It's a record-breaking gross margin of 34.7%. Andrew Simanek : Perfect, thanks Amit for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one? Operator : The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James, please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could discuss what you've done and what you plan to do in regards to price increases, and help us understand how this affects your sales growth and margins? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah, thanks, Simon, for the question. I will start, and then I will let Tarek comment. Listen, we take pricing actions all the time. In fact, we probably have the first to take pricing action in our industry, I will say. We continue to assess what is the right strategy by segment and making sure that we take those actions where appropriate.  The fact of the matter is that we have increased pricing even concrete. That's a fact. And we do that in a context of, obviously, supply availability, steep in demand in the right portfolio, and obviously, inflationary costs associated with some of the commodities.  At the same time, remember there is also new innovation against building our products, which has a structural impact in the sense that when you look at our infrastructure, new technologies drive two-thirds of the pricing in many ways in AOPs, but we could take close the actions all the time, Simon, and we will continue to do so. And that's part of the reason also while we see record-breaking margins but in addition to the fact that we're still in the demand in the right place and driving that mix shift that we talked about before. So Tarek, I know you want to get more specific, probably. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Simon, for the question. We have in this context where you have a constrained supply environment to be very careful around managing to price, right? And we have taken action that is translating in this record level of gross margin of 34.7%.  Some of our competitors didn't take that action, and it's down to them and up to them. But we feel that the current environment is calling for additions that approach to pricing. And we see an encouraged, balanced pricing behavior across the market. So more specifically, with respect to our units in AUP and Compute. I'm sure someone will ask the question. Tarek Robbiati : AUP was up to mid to high single-digits quarter-on-quarter reflecting pass-through of commodity costs and richer configurations. As always, configurations that are richer play a big rolling in the AUP, but also, pricing in this case. And units were flat quarter-over-quarter, given some expected supply chain constraints. So we feel pretty good about performance in computing.  In that regard, it's still a business that we have to manage very, very carefully on a day-to-day basis because the supply environment being volatile forces us to do so. But we still see scope for continuous gross margin improvement across the board and in Compute as well. Andrew Simanek : Perfect, thanks for the question, Simon. Operator, can we go to the next one? Operator : The next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I'm going to ask for one clarification real quick. How would you define normal seasonality in fiscal 4Q? And then the longer-term question would be, Tarek you've done a phenomenal job of driving gross margin leverage in the Company.  I'd just love to hear your thoughts on, as you think about the mix of visitors going forward, where do you think ultimately gross margin can actually go. What's the normalized gross margin in your mind, given the mix that HP's driving? Tarek Robbiati : So, let me pick up the first question on the normalized seasonality. Typically, what you observe in terms of sequential quarter-over-quarter growth, I would say it's somewhere in the low single-digits around the 1% to 2% range between Q3 and Q4. So Q4 and Q3 growth are about that level. Like I said in my script, I'm comfortable with the current consensus on revenue for Q4, and we feel pretty good about this. The order book is very, very solid. Antonio underscored this. Across the board, our order book is super solid. Now the question is, how much of that can be really accelerated in terms of conversion in Q4?  And it's, every day is another day, so we're working through that. And this obviously has an impact on gross margins, right? Because the more you wait for fulfilling an order, the more you can have an adverse impact on gross margins. But we feel fairly comfortable with us managing this dynamic and particularly leveraging or pulling the levers across the board that we have such as our revenue mix.  I want to highlight to you the continuous growth in Aruba. This level of growth in Aruba on our Intelligent Edge business of 23% comes with very high-calorie revenue, and we feel very, very comfortable and pleased with that trend. Also, our growth in storage, which comes with very high-calorie gross margin revenue, is pleasing at 3%. We took share from some of our main competitors, and this gives you an idea that we have a few strings in our bow, so to speak, to actually continue to drive gross margins to better levels. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Aaron (ph). Can we go to the next question, please, Operator? Operator : Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. You sound very bullish on order momentum and it seems like you can't capitalize on the full strong demand given some of the supply chain impacts. Is there any way to quantify the magnitude of sort of what is this revenue impact perhaps in the quarter and what you're expecting for maybe the next few quarters, and how confident are you that these orders won't be canceled or lost to other vendors? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, we are very confident in the sense that we have taken proactive actions. We continue to take proactive actions that can imagine a person evolve with some of this conversation with suppliers. But if you look at our order buffering -- sorry, inventory buffering we talked about, right? Our inventory is up 1.3 billion.  And at the same time, we have, I think, one of the best-in-class engineering teams that they can swap things as we go along the way. That said, as a look at this order book, there is so much potential upside here. Is all about that daily conversion.  And so far, once we -- we have not seen any cancellations. Just to be clear, when people ask me, hey, this is perishable? No, I can tell you, the answer is definitely, no. I think it's because also customers realize it's not just a supply constraint, but a need to provision more Compute and data insight capabilities.  And then, as I said earlier, even despite the fact that our Intelligent Edge business exited with a 5 times backlog on that unique segment of the market, we still delivered 23% in constant currency, 27% growth. And that's why what Tarek said, we expect revenue to continue to grow, and in particular '22. And then to the question that was asked earlier about margin, the margin should strengthen over time because of the mix shift, and that Aruba is very important to us.  But fundamentally, I think our edge-to-cloud vision and strategy is absolutely resonating in the market because customers need three things. They need secured connectivity in this hybrid world. They need a cloud experience everywhere. And then, they need data insights yesterday, in my view. And then, we need to be able to consume it as-a-service in an elastic way. We have all the forward ingredients, and that's why we're going to accelerate further and faster with this strategy because it's working. Tarek Robbiati : And on the -- if I can add to Antonio's comments. In my mind, there is no point crying over spilled milk. If we could have converted more, we would have converted more, but it doesn't really matter.  The order momentum and the order book remained strong. And what we didn't convert in Q3 will convert in Q4 and subsequent quarters. To specifically give you an idea of where we would have ended in Q3. We probably would have ended above seasonal trends that we see between Q2 and Q3 by a low-single-digit percentage number. But the momentum is very strong in Q4 and also for '22, that's the interesting bit.  In the environment that we're operating in, the demand is very solid and with the supply constraints, we don't see them ending before the first half of calendar year '22. So we just have to navigate this as the capacity of all our manufacturing partners is not back to pre-pandemic levels, and that will still take a good 2 to 3 quarters. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you Wamsi for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one, please? Operator : Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Great, and congrats on solid progress on the ARR side and in the cash flow. My question is on the HPC segment. You suggested the full-year HPC revenue will grow within your target range of 8% to 12%. Is that on a revenue basis or order basis? And in this revenue, it would imply fiscal Q2 will see at least 50% growth. Am I doing the math correctly? If so, what's driving such growth? I understand revenue could be quite lumpy in this business. Thanks. Antonio Neri : Yeah, let me start, and Tarek is welcome to -- Listen, as you said, right? This business is lumpy because it kind of takes to book the order to build the ship and install it. And then most importantly, the customer accepts the order, meaning the workload that was intended to run on is active -- is in production. And we normally see this trend accelerate in the back half of the year because of the way the acceptances work. So we absolutely expect a significant uptick here. And that's why we are very confident in our ability to deliver for the year 2021 the 8 to 12% growth that we committed.  Since the beginning actually of 2021. And we have a number of deals that are all now running the -- what we call the testing cycles. And fairly confident about the customer acceptances, which would allow us to recognize revenue.  This has nothing to do with supply availability in many ways because, obviously, those assistants, in many ways, have already shipped and they're already deployed. It just getting through the cycle for the customer to get the performance that they need.  And there is quite a bit of tuning that does get done when the systems are deployed. But to Tarek's point, the demand is unbelievably strong. Put aside the $2 billion award that we got yesterday, we announced yesterday, we continue to win multiple multi-million-dollar deals in many aspects. And you can see some of those as we announced throughout the quarter.  And that's the power of the portfolio we have in high-performance computing, and specifically, two  are in people earning capabilities. And by the way, we have $2.5 billion of award the business, which I don't consider backlog, is business that will be delivered over the next 12-18 months. In particular, the large Exascale systems, which are an amazing feat of technology, I will say. Andrew Simanek : Great, thanks Sidney for the question. Can we go to the next one, please? Operator : The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research, please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I was wondering if you can quantify how the shift to Greenlake and recurring revenue in as-a-Service is impacting revenue. If there's any way to sort of quantifying where you would have been if you hadn't sort of made the shift at this point. And I'm also curious with regard to Greenlake, how are your customer conversations going? Not sure how many quarters ago you said we're shifting everything to at least have an option from a subscription standpoint. So I'm just wondering if it's still kind of a push to customers or is there more of a pull from them as they look at alternatives to the cloud? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Shannon. I mean, we are incredibly bullish about this business. I think we have a competitive advantage. And the competitive advantage comes from many aspects. One is the software.  Software that makes this consumption model a true consumption model, unlike some of the other ones were trying to catch up, which is more financial engineering in many ways. Understand everybody's getting into the space, but we have years of leadership here.  And the conversation goes as simple as this. I want the cloud experience on Prime and at the Edge. And we can bring that through Greenlake because it's a true cloud experience that you can consume elastically on a per-unit measure that we can measure all the way to core levels.  And be able to automate the whole experience through our software stack, which obviously HBS model now, it's becoming a very important component of that. And that's why Tarek made the comment earlier as we go through the end of October, we are going to give a little better disclosure of that because the software content with ARR continues to increase.  Aruba by definition Shannon, is really old software, right? And he said that the triple-digit growth is happening in our business because you are subscribing to get connectivity. And our platform is a cloud platform that scales because we manage now more than 1.5 million devices.  But it's more than a pool, I would say. When customers are becoming way more sophisticated about the hybrid state, whether show hosted data, and whether show . They realize that the vast majority is still on-premise.  And many of them will stay on-premise. It's just economics and physics. And we can deliver some experience on-prem and still give them a hybrid experience by managing the workloads and  outside the four walls.  And Greenlake is absolute to resonate and that's why you see us catering everything to Greenlake, whether it's connectivity, whether its data services, whether it is elastically computed. And more world-optimized services as we go along.  And that's why I said earlier, this is all about acceleration on that. And between now and March, you're going to see a massive acceleration. And that's why it's my number one priority. And by the way, as revenue is accretive from a gross margin perspective, so, Tarek, you want to talk about that. Tarek Robbiati : Yeah, absolutely. So, Shannon, what I would say is, if you refer back to Slide 5 of our investor presentation, we showed the stack of revenue that composes our AUR, right? So our Greenlake revenue is across all segments, our Compute HPC MCS, storage, Aruba, and also HPFS as you can infer from that slide. And the more we drive Greenlake by way of software, the more accretive it is to the overall gross margin of the Company. That's a key lever to drive gross margin moving forward. We're driving gross margin across every single stream lane through the revenue mix, and across also that revenue mix horizontally by way of pivoting the Company to become an as-a-Service Company.  So far, what I can tell you is that the Greenlake gross margin is substantially higher than the average gross margin of the Company that we posted today. And we look forward, Antonio and I to update you and every other member of the analyst's community at our virtual SAM event in October highlighting to you where we see the ARR growing. And it's mixed by segment moving forward. And in composition, how much of it is software and how much of it comes from other types of revenue streams such as point NExOS, which are very important to the profitability of the Company. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Shannon. Next question, please, Operator. Operator : Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. Speaking of Greenlake, the 2 billion NSA contract is a great success story for that business. Should we assume that the 2 billion of revenue is recognized ratably over the 10-year contracts? Or will there still be lumpiness like you've seen in HPC historically and then also, when does that start to impact the financial model? Then I have a follow-up. Antonio Neri : I think it will be definitely recognized over time. There will be periods that will be a little bit lumpier because of the infrastructure, but start recognizing here in 2022 immediately. In fact, we're expecting here the first order to happen now and start shipping soon.  But obviously, the one thing you need to understand about this deal, it's not just about selling infrastructure and consumer-as-a-Service through HPE GreenLake is the true as-a-Service model and management at the same time. We are operating the whole environment, which is very different from then used to be in the past. Andrew Simanek : Thanks, Katy, I know you had a follow-up, but we'll catch you after the call. Operator, can we go to the next question, please? Operator : Our next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Pardon me, Mr. Sheerin, your line might be muted. Andrew Simanek : No problem. Operator, can we just go ahead to the next one? Operator : Yes. Our next question will come from Kyle Mcnealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle Mcnealy : Hi, thanks a lot for the question. Congrats on the strong results in Intelligent Edge. But I'm curious about where you think we can go from here. It's been growing at -- faster than what the market's typically grown at in the past.  We realize that Wi-Fi 6 adoption curve is helping that, but how sustainable do you think this 20% plus growth rate is that we're seeing now, and should we expect some deceleration in there, or are there potential for continuing momentum or acceleration with the Wi-Fi 6 upgrade? Antonio Neri : Listen, I expect this business to continue to grow double-digits, right? We're very confident with that forecast. And honestly, maintaining or improve it even, the level of profitability because as Tarek made the comment earlier, right?  This quarter was impacted by a settlement on a legal matter that has been going on for a decade. And so, I'm pleased that that finally has completed, which was $17 million that we booked for this and has nothing to do with Aruba. It just happened way before Aruba for that matter. And so, the reason why I'm confident is that we have a unique value proposition. The value proposition of Aruba is mobile-first cloud-first, which is based on three layers. One is the unification of the network for whatever type of connectivity you need, which is Wi-Fi and to the point, Wi-Fi 6 is now been adopted, and we are, I think, the largest vendor shipping Wi-Fi access points, second is obviously LAN, third is WAN, and that's why this acquisition has been incredibly well-received by our customers.  And very timely because it's integrated now in the same control plane. And going forward, we're going to integrate more solutions like 5G and Edge computing, and that's why this Edge-to-Cloud platform is essential.  But the Aruba Edge platform is what allows us to deliver the entire Edge-to-Cloud platform because now that platform also serves as the backend to deliver iAS for customer\u2019s on-prem and at the Edge for computer installers too, including data services or workload-optimized solutions.  So super pleased. And remember what I said, we exit Q3 2021 with a five times backlog on a normal run rate in that Aruba, and the bookings were very, very strong, super strong. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. And I think that takes us about time. So that'll be our final question. Antonio, why don't I turn it over to you for any final remarks if you have? Antonio Neri : Yes. So again, thank you for taking the time today. Again, we are very pleased with our Q3 result, which again was marked by the older strong momentum in line with revenue expectations, but most importantly, strong improvement in gross and operating margin, and record year-to-date orders and free cash flow.  And that gives us the confidence to, once again, for the fourth time in the year, raise EPS and free cash flow and enter 2022 with good visibility about what we think is going to happen. I'm particularly bullish about the IT spends cycle. People ask me, what do you think the Delta virus is going to do? It is going to do nothing on demand. I can tell you that now. It may have some impact on supply availability, but nothing on-demand, let me be clear about that.  And the reason why is because customers need to digitize their business, they need to create a more IT environment, and honestly, they need to extract insight from the data at a pace we've never seen before, and our Edge-to-Cloud platform strategy is resonating. So thank you for taking the time to be with us today, and hope to catch up at the end of October at the Securities Analyst Meeting. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thank you. Operator, I think we can go ahead and close out the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. And for those of you who attended our virtual Security Analyst Meeting last month, thank you. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss how our edge-to-cloud strategy position us to capture an expanded market opportunity and accelerate shareholder value creation. HPE ended fiscal year 2021 with strong momentum. Customers are responding to our edge-to-cloud value proposition as evidenced by the record demand for our solutions. Demand accelerated in the second half of the year, driving fiscal year 2021 orders growth of 16% year-over-year. Revenue of $27.8 billion in fiscal year 2021 grew in line with our long-term outlook, up 1% year-over-year. In fiscal year 2021, we executed very well, which enabled us to exceed our commitments across all financial metrics, even with a substantial order backlog. Our as-a-Service Annualized Revenue Run Rate or ARR of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. We significantly improved our gross and operating margins, which increased our fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP operating profit by 25% year-over-year. We delivered fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.96, up 27% year-over-year. And we generated the fiscal year 2021 free cash flow of $1.6 billion, up $1 billion year-over-year, which translates to growth of 177%. This was a very strong performance, and it was particularly impressive against the backdrop of industry-wide supply constraints, which continue to challenge our ability to convert orders to revenue as quickly as we would like. We have a world-class global operations team that continues to work closely with a long-standing diverse network of suppliers. We continue to take proactive inventory measures to better position us to deliver against this robust customer demand. Our results in Q4 strengthened the momentum we have as we enter fiscal year 2022. Increased demand in the quarter drove orders growth of 28% year-over-year, with particular strength in our as-a-Service orders, which grew an impressive 114% year-over-year, including a large network as-a-Service win. We also saw record levels of orders in key growth areas, including Intelligent Edge, High Performance Computing and Artificial Intelligence businesses. We delivered $7.4 billion in total Q4 revenue, which was up 7% sequentially and above normal sequential seasonality. We expanded our gross and operating margins, increasing our Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by 27% year-over-year. And we generated Q4 free cash flow of $94 million, in line with the outlook we provided at the end of Q3. Tarek will take you through our quarterly results in detail, but I would like to spend a little more time putting a full fiscal year in context for you. Our fiscal year 2021 results proved the relevance of our strategy to customers and the traction of our transformation to become the S2 cloud company. As we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, HPE is at the center of several compelling megatrends; the explosion of data at the edge, the mandate for a cloud experience everywhere, and the need to extract value from data to generate insights. HPE is differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy uniquely positions us to capitalize on these trends and capture growing profitable markets. Our solutions and services help customers overcome the challenges of multi-generation IT and enable them to access, control and maximize the value of all their workloads and data everywhere. We are executing with focus and speed to deliver against our vision and strategy. We are making strategic investments and taking deliberate steps to continue to shift our business. And as I have said previously, this transformation is my number one priority, and I'm proud of the progress we have made in fiscal year 2021. Our Intelligent Edge business grew fiscal year 2021 revenue 13% year-over-year, with orders exceeding for the first time $4 billion. Customer demand was up strong double digits year-over-year as more customers look for ways to create new digital experiences at the edge and capitalize on the data generated there. But the industry-wide component shortages kept us for converting our full order momentum to revenue in Q4, and we enter fiscal year 2022 with record levels of backlog. Our market leadership at the Edge remained very strong. HPE was positioned as the leader in - one of the leaders in the Magic Quadrant Gartner provides for wireless access network edge infrastructure, which is notable because HP is only one of the two companies to be positioned in the Leader Quadrant four years in a row. We continue to drive strong innovation in this business. In Q4, we introduced the industry-first distributed services switch, which brings software-defined services and security right to where the data is created in process. Developed in partnership with Pensando, this solution eliminates legacy appliances and whole software needed to build the hybrid cloud demand - demanded by modern applications and IT organizations. In Q4, we closed the largest network as-a-Service deal in HP history to help a large US retailer enhance its customer and employee experience throughout the stores. In addition, the Major League soccer franchise, FC Cincinnati, standardized on Aruba at the TQL Stadium to deliver next-generation digital cashless, counterless fund and event experiences. The franchise deployed an end-to-end Aruba Edge Services platform network at its new 26,000-seat stadium to power this game day and special event experiences. Orders of HPE's High Performance Compute and AI offerings were also up strong double digits year-over-year. This record level of demand has generated an order book of awarded contracts now at $2.7 billion, excluding the important $2 billion win with the U.S. National Security Agency. HPE expanded our number one market position in HPC with 37% market share as of calendar Q2 data, which is more than 14 points above the closest competitor. And according to the list of the top 500 supercomputers released just two weeks ago, 33 of the top 100 most powerful supercomputers in the world were built by HPE. This is more than any company. At the end of Q4, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, NERSC at Berkeley Lab accepted the first phase of the promoter supercomputer. Powered by the HPE Cray EX system, Bermuda introduced a new generation of supercomputing capabilities to more than 8,000 scientists performing research for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science. HPE is uniquely positioned to bring the AI, deep learning and data analytics capabilities of our most advanced supercomputers to mainstream enterprises through the HPE GreenLake platform. In Q4, we announced that Eni, a global energy company, selected HP GreenLake to upgrade its existing HPE supercomputer. Through HPE GreenLake, Eni can accelerate discover - discovery of new energy sources with more accurate modeling and simulations, as well as become more sustainable by monitor utilization and energy consumption within an - as-a-Service solution. We continue to strengthen our Compute and Storage businesses where we saw strong orders and profitability in fiscal year 2021. In Compute, orders increased more than 10% in fiscal year '21 and we delivered operating margins of 10.8%, up 260 basis points year-over-year. We are making bold moves to transform our Storage business into a cloud-native data services business, which resulted in a high single-digit order growth and gross margin expansion, up 130 basis points year-over-year. And we continue to see high services attach rate, helping enable HP Pointnext orders to increase mid-single digits in fiscal year '21. This contributed to the overall performance of HPE Pointnext, which ended fiscal year 2021 with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.15 of revenues, highlighting the potential for future revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. In fiscal year 2021, we generated a strong momentum in our transformation to an as-a-Service company. Our company as-a-Service orders increased 61% year-over-year, with HPE GreenLake orders increasing 46% year-over-year. Our as-a-Service annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $796 million was up 36% year-over-year. The growth of our ARR is particularly noteworthy because, this recurring revenue stream is high quality and high margin. During our Security Analyst Meeting last month, Tarek shared that more than 60% of our ARR mix is software and services. And we believe that portion will grow to more than three quarters in the next three years. Our ARR gross margins are well above our corporate average gross margins today. And the addition of high-value software content will drive margins even higher. Our pivot to an as-a-Service company is enabled by HPE Financial Services, which increased fiscal year 2021 financing volume 3% year-over-year, driven by strong growth within HPE GreenLake. We continue to advance our leadership in our HP GreenLake offering. In September, we introduced HP GreenLake for data protection, which are cloud services designed to protect data across edge-to-cloud overcome brands of war attacks and deliver rapid data recovery. This new set of solutions marks our entry into the growing data protection as-a-Service market. Our acquisition of Zerto enabled us to add market-leading data protection to our cloud services portfolio to help enterprises take cyber threats and ransomware attacks head on. We also launched HP GreenLake for data analytics, which includes the industry-first, unified modern hybrid analytics and Data Lake platform. This strategically important solution positions HPE in the growing Unifi analytics market and helps customers accelerate modernization initiatives for all data across edge-to-cloud. We continue to see incredible response to our HP GreenLake offering. We added more than 300 new GreenLake customers during fiscal year 2021, bringing our customer count to more than 1,250. New GreenLake logos represent an increasing share of orders with approximately one quarter of Q4 GreenLake orders coming from new customers. Today, more than 900 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest, partner of ecosystems selling as-a-Service offerings in the industry. We added more than $1.5 billion of GreenLake total contract value over the last year, bringing the total to more than $5.7 billion. Examples of new GreenLake logos includes family estates, the second largest family-owned winery in the world which adopted HPE GreenLake through our channel partner PKA technologies to add flexibility and scale, its capacity to meet the increasing demand of Auto - N&F Automations. The HPE GreenLake solution powers the one in this automated warehouse, where approximately 60 different types of wines that produce mobile package and prepare for shipping while reducing overall IT costs. We also won a deal with ONGC, India's largest Oil and Natural Gas Company, which is used in the HP GreenLake platform to make one of the largest SAP implementations in the world more manageable and flexible. Our Q4 rounded out an impressive year for HPE. And I'm proud of all we've had accomplished. We have made incredible progress in transforming to become the edge-to-cloud leader, executing on our strategy to help customers in truly differentiated ways and position ourselves for sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders. At the same time, we have advanced our ESG initiatives, which in Q4 earned us a position on a highly competitive Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, placing in the 98 percentile. We exceeded our commitments in fiscal year 2021, and our momentum is strong as we enter fiscal year 2022 with a strategy more relevant to customers than ever before and a sharp focus on execution. With that, I will turn it over to Tarek to share additional details about the quarter. Tarek, over to you. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. And as usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance in the quarter. Antonio discussed the key fiscal year 2021 highlights on Slides 1 and 2, so now let me discuss our Q4 performance, starting with Slide 3. I am very pleased to report that we continue to see unprecedented demand across all our businesses with robust order growth, up 28% year-over-year. Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q4 revenues of $7.4 billion, up 7% from the prior quarter above normal sequential seasonality and this despite increased supply chain challenges that we foreshadowed at SAM last month. It's also worth highlighting that $7.4 billion of revenue represents the highest level since Q1 of fiscal year 2019, well before the pandemic. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 33%, which was up 230 basis points from the prior year. And this was driven by our deliberate actions to shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings, strong pricing discipline and cost takeout. As previously indicated, gross margins were pressured from prior quarter levels due to an increasing industry-wide shortages of certain components that have resulted in extended lead times and higher commodity costs underpinning backlogged orders. We continue to take proactive inventory measures and display healthy price discipline to minimize the impact of recent disruptions. We expect this dynamic supply chain situation to last well into calendar year 2022. We also continue to invest in high gross margin-rich areas of our portfolio. We've made investments in our overall go-to-market to accelerate our growth and our shift to an as-a-Service model. Even with these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 16% year-over-year increase in operating profit. Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder venture portfolio, an outstanding operational performance in HPC that I will address in more detail later. With strong execution across the business, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, up 27% from the prior year and at the high end of our outlook range for Q4. Excluding $2.2 billion of after-tax proceeds received from Oracle satisfaction of the judgment in the Itanium litigation, Q4 cash flow from operations was $784 million, and free cash flow was $94 million. For fiscal year 2021, this brings our total cash flow from operations to $3.7 billion, up $1.5 billion from the prior year, and our free cash flow to $1.6 billion, up $1 billion from the prior year driven primarily by an increase in earnings. Our strong execution and cost optimization and resource allocation program has effectively put us one year ahead of schedule with respect to delivering our previous free cash flow targets.  Finally, the strength of our cash flow has positioned us to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $157 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q1 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in January. We also reinstated our share repurchase program in Q4 buying $213 million in shares, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation and our view that the stock is undervalued. Slide 4 highlights key metrics of our accelerating as-a-Service business. We have made significant progress over the last year by adding over 300 new enterprise GreenLake customers to over 1,250 today and increasing our TCV by over $1.5 billion to our current lifetime TCV of over $5.7 billion. For Q4 specifically, our ARR was $796 million, which was up 36% year-over-year as reported and total as-a-Service orders were up 114% year-over-year, which represents an acceleration from Q3, demonstrating the strong momentum we are experiencing in this business. It's also important to remember the incremental disclosure we provided at SAM 2021, highlighting the significant proportion of software and services in our offerings that together make up more than 60% of the ARR mix today. We expect this mix percentage to expand to more than 75% by fiscal year 2024 as we add more software capabilities driving further gross margin improvement. Overall, based on strong momentum this year, I'm very happy with how this business is progressing, which gives us confidence to increase our ARR growth targets by 5 points to a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses, which now represent nearly 25% of our total company revenue, generated record levels of orders, up strong double-digits. In the Intelligent Edge, revenue grew 2% year-over-year in Q4 and for fiscal year 2021 was up 13%. Demand continued unabated in Q4 with order growth up over 50% year-over-year, but the component shortages we foreshadowed at SAM were more pronounced in our Aruba business. Additionally, our Edge-as-a-Service offerings were up trip triple digits year-over-year, significantly contributing to our ARR. We delivered a multimillion-dollar NaaS, Network-as-a-Service deal in Q4 for a large US customer, which represented more than 800 basis points headwind in the short-term to Aruba revenue in Q4, but will help our long-term financial profile in the business. Aruba Services also continued to grow strongly, up high single digits. Looking forward, we expect it will take some time for supply chain challenges to ease, but we finished fiscal year 2021 with over $4 billion in orders which will give us strong momentum through fiscal year 2022. In HPC & AI, demand strengthened even further with another record level of orders. Revenue grew 35% sequentially and was flat year-over-year with a difficult compare. We did have customer acceptances of some large contracts get pushed out into fiscal year 2022. And we now have $2.7 billion of awarded contracts in addition to the $2 billion contract awarded by the NSA, giving us confidence for next year and beyond. We expect robust revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 to get us back within the range of our original long term 8% to 12% CAGR outlook. In Compute, order growth was up strong double digits. Revenue grew 4% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting above normal sequential seasonality and was up double digits year-over-year when normalizing for the Q4 FY 2020 backlog. Operating margins of 9.4% were up 280 basis points from prior year due to disciplined pricing and the rightsizing of the cost structure in this segment. Within Storage, order growth accelerated and was up double digits year-over-year. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter ahead of normal sequential seasonality, driven by strong growth in software-defined offerings. All-flash arrays grew 7% year-over-year, led by Primera, up strong double digits. Nimble grew 4% year-over-year, with ongoing strong dHCI momentum, growing double digits year-over-year. Storage operating profit margin was 13.8%, reflecting OpEx investments to continue driving product mix shift towards more software-rich platforms, including our cloud data services. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including Nimble services, orders accelerated and were up high single digits in Q4 and up mid-single digits for fiscal year 2021. Most importantly, revenue also grew as reported overall for fiscal year 2021, the first time in several years. This is, again, very important, as we enter fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum in our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 18% year-over-year, driven by strong double-digit growth in GreenLake. Revenue was up 3% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Our profitability is also benefiting from higher residual values realization and lower borrowing costs, as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 14.1%, up 630 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 23.8% is well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 6 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum throughout fiscal year 2021. As mentioned previously, Q4 revenue of $7.4 billion is the highest level we've delivered since Q1 2019. With a strong demand environment, our strategic business mix shift and execution of our cost optimization and resource allocation program, we increased our Q4 non-GAAP EPS to $0.52, up 27% year-over-year. Turning to Slide 7. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33%. While rates were impacted as expected sequentially from the supply chain challenges previously discussed, we expanded gross margins up 230 basis points from the prior year. This was driven by strong pricing discipline and a positive mix shift towards high-margin software-rich businesses. In total, in fiscal year 2021, we delivered nearly $900 million of incremental gross profit. Moving forward, we will face lingering supply chain challenges in the near term, but longer term, structural gross margins will improve from continuous mix shift towards the intelligent edge or IP storage Green Lake and all of our as-a-Service offerings. Moving to Slide 8. You can see we have utilized some of the incremental gross profit to make targeted growth investments while simultaneously expanding non-GAAP operating profit margins. We have increased our investment levels in R&D to fuel our long-term innovation engine and still selling costs to accelerate our growth and higher shift to our as-a-Service pivot. Even with these investments to drive long-term growth, we delivered operating margins in Q4 of 9.7%, up 120 basis points from the prior year. On Slide 9, we want to highlight our unique setup in China through our investment in HPC that has and continues to generate tremendous value for our shareholders. Our investment and commercial agreement gives us a route-to-market in the second largest, fastest-growing IT market in the world. As you know, we do not consolidate revenue and operating profit from HPC, but recognize our 49% share of HPC's earnings through the equity interest statement line on our P&L as part of other income and expense. HPC has delivered outstanding operational performance throughout the year and generated $257 million of equity interest in fiscal year '21, which was up 21% from the prior year. This makes our business in China a very large contributor to our P&L, one that no other multinational has been able to replicate. Turning to Slide 10. We finished fiscal year '21 generating $3.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.6 billion of free cash flow, and this excluding, obviously, the $2.2 billion of after-tax, cash received from Oracle satisfaction of the Itanium litigation. Free cash flow was up $1 billion year-over-year and is $600 million more than the midpoint of our outlook at the start of fiscal year '20, primarily driven by increased earnings. Our cash flow profile is becoming more predictable and aligned to profitability as our restructuring costs diminish, and we grow our as-a-Service business beginning to recognize more deferred revenues from software and services. Moving on to Slide 11. We have made further progress enhancing our balance sheet strength with a strong free cash flow and payment from Oracle. Following the receipt of the cash from the Itanium litigation, we redeemed early, our $1 billion 4.65% coupon outstanding 2024 notes and this in a positive NPV transaction that is net debt-neutral. The  premium paid was a GAAP-only expense in Q4, and we will realize meaningful interest expense savings over the next three years. We are now in an operating company net cash position of $1.8 billion. Bottom line, our improved free cash flow outlook and cash position ensure we have ample liquidity available to balance long-term growth investments with consistent return of capital to our shareholders. Now, turning to our outlook on Slide 12. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we provided our outlook for fiscal year '22, and I would like to encourage you to review my presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. Having said that, let me reiterate the drill down into a few key components. We expect fiscal year '22 revenue growth in constant currency of 3% to 4%. As discussed, the supply chain environment remains very dynamic, and we expect component shortages with increased commodity costs, expedite and shipping fees to last for the next few quarters impacting near-term revenue and gross margins. In a nutshell, we expect to have more of a back-end loaded year in fiscal year '22 with the supply chain risk that we discussed reflected in our fiscal year '22 guidance. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be $1.96 to $2.10 and free cash flow to be $1.8 billion to $2 billion. We expect free cash flow to be more in line with historical seasonality where the second half is a stronger generator of cash than the first half. Now specific to Q1 revenue, given the very strong backlog balanced by supply chain constraints, we expect revenue to be in line with normal sequential seasonality of down mid-single digits from Q4 of fiscal year 2021 and are comfortable with current consensus levels. We also expect gross margins to be pressured in the short-term given supply chain. As a result, for Q1 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.19 to $0.27 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42 to $0.50. So overall, I'm very proud of our progress throughout our strong fiscal year 2021. As Antonio said, we exceeded all our key financial targets in fiscal year 2021, often by a significant margin. The demand environment has been incredibly strong across our business with acceleration in the second half of fiscal year 2021; demonstrating that our edge-to-cloud strategy is working well and that we are entering fiscal year 2022 with strong momentum. We are now well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity in front of us and deliver against our fiscal year 2022 outlook. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  Our first question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a little bit more into the as-a-Service performance. Obviously, orders are extremely strong during the quarter. How much of that was from the one-time - not one-time, but from the large contract signed, how should we think about the longer-term growth potential, how it flows through the model as we look to the next year or two? And I don't know maybe if you can give a little bit more on the composition of the as-a-Service, is there any one product, or service that's really driving that business at this point in time? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Shannon. I will start, and obviously, I would like Tarek to comment on the model in itself. Listen, we are super proud of the momentum we have in the market with HPE GreenLake. We believe it's truly differentiated in the market. And as we show you some, two-thirds of that is already in the software and services, and we believe in three years, will be more than 75% of it, which obviously come with high margin and more durable revenue in many ways. What customers like about the model is the ability to procure everything from Edge to cloud from one integrated platform. And it's not just what I call Infrastructure as-a-Service or hardware as-a-Service on premises in a colo or at the Edge is the fact that they can consume anything from network as-a-Service, subscription to Aruba products to what I call private cloud to data services, which is part of the transformation we are driving in our storage portfolio. And as we said, $5.7 billion already in total contract value and in Q4, the growth was accelerated by a number of new logos, which again, we added 300 in fiscal year 2021, which drove the order growth to 114%, okay? So when you think about this, we have been delivering 40, 50, 60 and in Q4 it was 114%. And Aruba is one key component of that. But what we see now, Shannon, is also the Storage part of it is growing very rapidly. And that's why I'm excited about next year because we're also adding new capabilities to that platform, particularly in the early part of 2022. So overall, I will say this has been a home run. We believe we have years of advantage. We are disclosing all our numbers, as you see, versus some of our competitors are not sharing anything as far as I can see. And what I'm really pleased is that we have now 900 partners selling with us, co-selling, and you will see their offers in our platform here soon because that's the way we drive, fully push from both sides, direct and indirect. So Tarek, do you want to talk about the modeling? Tarek Robbiati : So yes, Sharon, I mean, Antonio said already quite a few things. So first and foremost is one - the first - this first and largest network as-a-Service contract contributed to orders in Q4 substantially, but did not contribute to the ARR because the revenue will be recognized over time. But notwithstanding that, the ARR, if you really look at our ARR progression quarter-after-quarter in fiscal year 2021, it's outstanding. We did $649 million in Q1 of ARR, grew that to $678 million in Q2, $705 million in Q3 and now approaching $800 million, $796 million to be precise in Q4. So the momentum in this business is extremely strong, and there isn't a particular business unit that is contributing. We're executing an integrated strategy that is about edge, cloud and data. Right now, the main contributors are the various parts of the organization that fit these three pillars. Aruba is one of them. The Storage business unit is another one. We will also continue to expand our as-a-Service offerings in HPC and AI because we see a tremendous opportunity there. And the future will tell us how big that opportunity will be for us. But we firmly believe in it. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Shannon. Operator, next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Antonio, I'm trying to reconcile your comments around strong backlog, which you guys have been very consistent about. Relative to what happened in the quarter and the guide here for - in the near-term, it sounds like component shortages were a major reason for that, but you're maintaining your full year guide. So just trying to understand like what gives you the confidence that these will resolve itself? And what gives you the confidence that this is - this back-end loaded year is going to pan out as you're seeing it now? Antonio Neri : Sure. Well, I mean, if you look at our results, right, once - right, so we grew orders. Total company orders 16% year-over-year, but our revenue in actual dollars was up 3%. Obviously, there is a big divergence there between 16% and 3%, right? And that's driven by the supply availability. Despite the fact that we continue, I think, do a great job navigating through the challenge. And the one area I'm really particularly pleased, one say is the fact that linearity in the business in the way we approach customers that book orders is now more front end and back end in the quarter itself. I always talk about quarters having 13 weeks and what is amazing to me in the last couple of quarters, the bookings have been more on the front end than the back end, which allows us, actually. It's a little bit counterintuitive if you think about it. The more orders are - bring early on, the more I can convert despite the supply chain challenges because I have more time and more velocity, if you will. So listen, as Tarek said, and I said in my remarks, short-term, we're going continue to navigate. This is an industry-wide challenge. But we're very confident with the actions we are taking ourselves. And the fact of the matter is that that backlog is very durable. People asked me early on, have you seen cancellation? I can tell you right now, zero, no cancellations whatsoever. And the orders coming in every day, every week is incredibly strong. So, we have to navigate the next quarter or two. And then based on our understanding and the work we have done with our suppliers, the second half will be better. And then also remember, we have, I think, world-class capabilities, both on the supply chain operations and our engineering capabilities to be able to adjust components based on the bump. And then also, remember, a big chunk of the backlog is related to acceptances in the customer base with HPC, which is already built and shipped. But as you know, we cannot recognize revenue until fully accepted. This quarter, we recognized a customer, which had a large order in HPC. But remember, in 2022, we have the large exascale deals and one of them is going to be very important for us as we think about the back half of the year. So, that's why Tarek and I are very confident in that 3% to 4% guidance. And let's remind ourselves in the 3% to 4% guidance, we have 1 to 1.5 points of headwind because of the transition towards as a service, right, which is great, is durable is long-term growth. And so you normalize for that, it's more like 5% to 5.5%, if you will. And then on top of that, you have to add the currency, which obviously is a headwind in the sense that the 3% to 4% is constant currency. So, if you are all of that, we are more than like in the 7% to 8% growth. And remember that Q4 was a $7.4 billion, the largest quarter despite the supply chain going all the way back to 2019. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Wamsi. Operator? Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. On this 28% order growth, I'm wondering if you could unpack maybe some of the factors that contributed to it. And what I'm thinking about is, is there an aspect here of customers trying to get in ahead of price increases or an aspect of customers placing orders earlier because of extended lead-times. If you could just help us understand what you see contributing to that massive number? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, glad you call it massive because we agree with you. It's a strong momentum and clearly was stronger in Q3 and Q4 than the first half of the year. I think it's a combination, Simon. I think that obviously, there is a market demand out there driven by the recovery in the economy. I think customers also worry about the impact of the supply that we'll have in the short, mid-term. But on the same time, we should not underestimate the power of our portfolio because I got this question earlier on, you take this double-bookings? Perhaps in the commodity space, but not on the value space. We believe Aruba is unique and differentiated. This is not something you can swap by somebody else. And that business, it's a true mobile-first cloud-native approach, which drives a unique experience at the edge. And that's - the momentum has happened for a number of quarters now despite the short-term challenge of supply. HPC, we are the clear number one leader with 35% market share and 14 points advantage against the second competitor. And then the supercomputer, I don't think there's anybody that can match us. 35% of the top 100 supercomputers are all back and enterprise, and we're going to deliver the extra scale in 2022. And GreenLake, again, the question about GreenLake is a true hybrid differentiated offerings from edge to cloud. And I think that has been in the making now for a number of years, and the pipeline is just amazing to me. And now we are getting better and better in closing deals faster and deploying the solution, which, remember, it's not just deploying it, it's also driving usage. And so it's a combination of growth in the current installed base and new logos, which I commented 300 new logos. So we believe there may be some in the commodity space, but the rest is because of our edge-to-cloud offering, which is resonating in the market, and we believe that's going to accelerate in 2022. Operator : The next question is from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle McNealy : Thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could drill down a bit more in the areas that are driving your Compute segment results? They were a bit higher than we expected and certainly the consensus, I get that there's some FX in there. You quantified that. But are there segments of the market that have been stronger for you that you can contextualize? And can you give us a sense for unit growth for Compute? And maybe a split of how much ASP growth comes from memory versus product mix versus general price increases? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Go ahead, Tarek, and then I will comment on the end, on the back end. Tarek Robbiati : Sure, Kyle. So in terms of customer segments, the demand remains very strong across the board and large enterprise customers, SaaS companies, telcos, and we see very robust demand from all these customers. With respect to unit growth, units have been roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but the right comparison is a normalized year-over-year comparison. If you normalize for Q4 2020 units that were sold, but for orders that were generated in Q1 and Q2, you remember the dynamics of fiscal year 2020, units have grown 13% Q4 2021 over normalized Q4 2020. Which is an excellent result for us. We're very pleased with it. And this comes together with very strong disciplines from our management team there in the compute space. We've executed a number of price increases ahead of price hikes of commodities and logistics costs coming up by way of expedite fees and container costs that have been rising quite dramatically, as you know. The AUP have risen overall at about 3%. When you think about this on a normalized basis, and we feel pretty good about our performance in Compute, both on the P, the price and the quantity. We feel that there is still strong demand moving forward, particularly in fiscal year 2022 with the order book that we have been able to generate and the backlog that we have in that segment. But that comment that I just made is true and very true for Aruba where we feel a very strong order demand in Aruba and also in storage. So we feel pretty good about fiscal year 2022, as Antonio commented a moment ago. Antonio Neri : Yes. Just to add a few comments. In simple terms, this is the way to think about it. So first of all, our compute orders were up more than 10% in 2021. Our units normalized for - remember, the 2020 backlog, if you remember, when the COVID started, we had a $750 million backlog which we cleared $500 million in Q3 2020 and $250 million in Q4. When you normalize for that, units are up. Obviously, AUPs are up for two reasons; number one, cost; and number two, structural changes. As we introduce the next-generation of our Compute platform, call it, Gen 10.5 and 11 you're going to see more options and more density in those platform, which drives structural changes, which are - we believe those structural changes are sustainable, irrespective of the changes of the commodity cost. And then if you listen to what we said in 2020 and 2021 are pivot to different segments of the market, we said we want to focus on growing segments of the market, while enterprise is still super important. SaaS, Telco and Edge are three growing markets where we have been benefit from. Telco obviously with a 5G deployment our Intelligent Edge Solutions at the Edge, particularly in retail, manufacturing and hospitality, and then obviously, the focus on the SaaS, which is not the big cloud providers, but Software-as-a-Service companies, which are driving quite significant growth. And then we have our own value of built into the platform with silicon root of trust and manageability. And all of this, by the way, is all now being delivered to HPE GreenLake as well. So GreenLake is a force multiplier for the growth in Compute, because the more we sell as-a-Service, the more recurring revenue in Compute we're going to have over time. So I hope that answers the question. Operator : The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. Antonio, how should we reconcile your commentary on incredibly strong order growth in just about every business and orders up 16% in fiscal 2021 with the 3% revenue growth that you reported last year, and the similar 3% to 4% revenue growth for fiscal 2022? Is there a point that these really strong orders convert to a meaningful acceleration in revenue growth? And if so, which quarter of fiscal 2022, do you think we could see that backlog flush? Antonio Neri : Yes, I'll let Tarek start, and then I will add a few comments. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So Katy, the most important comment I would make to you with respect to orders is that the acceleration of orders manifested itself very strongly in the second half of fiscal year 2021. And it's continuing from here on, the demand remains very strong. We're getting orders every day, and the linearity is better even this quarter than it was in the prior quarter last year. The trough for our business was hit in the second quarter of 2020 ever since revenue has been edging up. And we're now at a point in Q4 2021, where we hit the revenue that is at the high watermark that is on the par with the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 roughly. We do see the acceleration of the revenue growth year-over-year manifesting itself on a full year basis. But timing-wise, we did say in my script and hopefully, it was understood that, the fiscal year 2022 is going to be back-end loaded. Why is that? It's because we still have to navigate supply chain constraints and those supply chain constraints are probably not going to abate before the end of fiscal year 2022 and most likely calendar year 2022. Specifically for Q1, we're comfortable with current consensus levels on revenue and which also imply, as I said in my script, a seasonal decline of mid-single digits. But when you really look at the overall trend, year-over-year from now on, we do expect an acceleration of revenue that will be dampened a little bit by supply chain constraint that we're navigating day-after-day, month-after-month and quarter-after-quarter. Antonio Neri : Yes. Katy, I think in addition to what Tarek, first of all, I don't see the demand abating anytime soon. I actually see that continue to accelerate. And what is amazing to me is that in the areas where we place a particular focus, we see amazing growth. And what excites me is that I - knowing what I know about our new offerings and acceleration of innovation particularly in the first calendar quarter, we believe that's going to be a turbocharge. Now as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time with our global supply team - driving the day-to-day operations with Tarek here. And obviously, we have to move at the first two quarters of the year. But I feel pretty good about accelerating that in the back half, a combination of supply availability and customer acceptances. But again, when you normalize the growth for everything I said earlier to Wamsi, which is including the as-a-Service pivot, you should think about not three to four, but more like six to seven because that's the way we should think about it. And then in that, remember, the growth of the ARR is going to continue to accelerate 35% to 45%. And hopefully, in 2022, we're going to get the credit for the transformation we drive in this business. Operator : The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : I guess, maybe I want to talk a little bit on the Intelligent Edge side. And Tarek, maybe you could just talk about what's driving out just the revenue deceleration, but also the margin declines over there. The margin drop seemed fairly material. So I would love to understand kind of what's happening there. How do you see that business ramp up through fiscal 2022? And then, Antonio, I want to touch this with you, which is you've talked a fair bit about the conviction in the orders that you have and how good they are and I think you've said about a lack of cancellation being a pretty big driver for it, therefore your confidence. I would imagine cancellations will only happen when supply chain issues alleviate versus right now. Is that fair? If so, are there other things you're looking at in your business that gives you confidence that these orders will convert? Antonio Neri : Tarek, you want to talk about the - the Aruba piece of it which obviously the Network-as-a-Service was a big component of that? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, yes. So let me take that, Antonio. Thank you. So Amit, as we shared in our scripts, we signed a very substantial Network-as-a-Service contract for the first time with a large US retailer. And this had a headwind on revenue growth in Aruba of about 800 basis points and a headwind on operating margins of about 500 basis points. So if you were to normalize for it, you still realize - you would realize that the double-digit growth in Aruba and high-teens margins are still there. And we're very comfortable they're there for us. Aruba is at 40% business meaning we do see the top-line growth to be in the high-teens and the margins to be in the high-teens as well, approaching a sum of 40% overall. Nothing has changed. We feel very comfortable, particularly knowing that the order book remains very strong. If anything, there was one part of our company that suffered a little bit more of supply chain constraints in Q4, it is Aruba. But it's just simply deferring revenue that could have been realized in Q4 into Q1 and Q2 of fiscal year 2022. The order story remains incredibly strong, and the demand there is super solid. So we're very confident about the prospects of Aruba for fiscal year 2022. Antonio Neri : Yes. I mean, I think that we covered pretty much everything. Remember what the net $800 million at this time. So very pleased with that, which makes us a more lean and agile company. And part of that is also the ability to execute faster. One of the big changes we made also was the way we compensate our sales force on orders, and this is what you see. We are now confident based on our systems implementation. If you recall, we started three years ago. And we are also getting close to that completion, allowed us to make some changes here in the way we drive the business going forward. And I think this is all about operational excellence and execution. On the inventory side, I think the team has done a remarkable job driving working capital and - but also at the same time, making the right long-term bets on this inventory, which give us not just the ability to convert but pricing power. And as I said in the Security Analyst Meeting, we tend to be the market leader in changing prices. And we will continue to do so, because it's the right thing to do at the right time. And so we will continue to manage that inventory as needed for our customers and for delivering of numbers. Operator : And our final question will be from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess I wanted to get your thoughts on H3C. You had a strong year with plus growth in equity income. How should we think about kind of fiscal 2022 there? And what's your visibility into H3C navigating the supply chain constraints as well? And through the conference call today, you've mentioned multiple times about a back-end loaded year. So just wanted to see if that's consistent with how should we think about, H3C equity income as well? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Well, Tarek and I felt it was important to share with you how H3C contributes to our financial performance. You saw that slide that shows the equity interest of 49% and what value drives for our shareholders, which is pretty significant. And H3C is an independent entity, which operates in China, obviously. And they manage the business day-to-day. And they have done a remarkable job. I mean they continue to grow their business in China. They are positioned extremely well, in the, what they call the ICT business, the support telco, the support enterprise customers and SMB. They have a unique value proposition and set of products, which are very well received. And we expect that business to continue to grow double-digits. And the report is incredibly accretive to what we do. But also, at the same time, as Tarek said, is a unique setup, which no other multinational really has been able to achieve in a country, obviously, which is going to a lot of changes here. And it's the second largest market on the planet, okay? So if you believe that market will continue to grow, and they are very well positioned, this will continue to accrete to our shareholders. Now as we said in previous quarters, are put expire at the May timeframe. Tarek Robbiati : That's right. Antonio Neri : And as always, we will do what is the right thing for our shareholders, what is the best return for our shareholders. And we will make that decision at the right time. Tarek Robbiati : And Antonio said it very well. I would simply add that the interesting data point on the slide, and hopefully, you all take away is that, we're not in a rush. The value of our stake continues to accrete. And we feel very, very good about our position in H3C. Antonio Neri : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. Thank you, Jeff. We appreciate you making the time to talk to us today. I hope you walk away with a clear view of how we are performing. I'm particularly pleased with the momentum we have as we enter 2022. Our strategy could not be more on point. I think the demand is strong, not only because of the market, but because of our solutions. And I'm very excited about the ability to create and accelerate our shareholder value in 2022. And then we have some amazing things coming down the pipeline in terms of innovation that's going to differentiate us even further. And so I'm looking forward to 2022, while we navigate this short-term challenge of supply, but we are very confident on the current guidance and the consensus out there. And we hope to exceed that as we execute in the next quarter. If I don't speak to you in the next month or so, thank you very much. Be well. Happy Holidays to everyone and to prosper 2022. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

Antonio Neri : Thanks, Andy. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before I discuss our results, I would like to address the evolving situation in Ukraine and how we are responding. Our first priority in the region is the safety of our team members, our contingent workers and their immediate families. We are conducting regular proactive outreach to our workforce in Ukraine to offer emergency assistance, making our security team available 24/7 to help. The HP Foundation has established a special giving campaign for our team members to support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, which has already raised $150,000 in just over 24 hours. And we are expanding the time off we offer team members to volunteer so those in the regions can care for their families and participate in humanitarian relief activities. From the business perspective, we have suspended all shipments into Russia at this time and we'll continue to adhere to all relevant sanctions and export controls.  Now let me review our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Hewlett Packard Enterprise deliver a solid performance. The quarter was characterized by robust customer demand and profitability, demonstrating the strength of our differentiated edge-to-cloud strategy and our portfolio innovation. Our business pivot is further strengthening our growth and operating margins. As a result of our overall performance this quarter, we are increasing our outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for the full fiscal year 2022.  In Q1 we saw all the growth of 20% from the prior year period, including 136% rise in other service orders. We increased total HP revenue by 2% year-over-year to $7 billion, despite continued industry wide supply constraints, which slowed our ability to convert orders and record breaking backlog to revenue. We generated a non-GAAP gross profit margins of 33.9% higher than the prior quarter and prior year. I'm particularly pleased that we delivered 11% non-GAAP operating margin. Free cash flow was negative $577 million in the quarter, reflecting normal seasonality and proactive actions we continue to take the for the buffer inventories in order to meet robust customer demand and forward-looking growth.  The performance we deliver this quarter was not worthy in a micro environment that continues to be defined industry wide by supply shortages and overloaded logistic channels. Our global operations team is mitigating the impact by prudently building inventory when appropriate, and leaning on our long-standing supplier relationships. We continue to utilize our world class supply chain engineering capabilities to adjust the type of components we use, shifted into those that are more readily available.  We are not seen any noticeable order cancellations from customers due to elongated delivery times. And we continue to take pricing actions in this inflationary environment. As we discussed previously, we expect supply constraints we likely last well into the second half of calendar year 2022.  Demand for our differentiated edge-to-cloud products and solutions continues to be very strong, with Q1 marking the third consecutive quarter, we have generated a year-over-year order growth above 20%. This was also the second consecutive quarter of that our as-a-service orders more than doubled year-over-year.  Customers are turning to HP for a differentiated portfolio adopting our solutions to drive their transformation at the faster and faster pace. Several key technology trends that are shaping the IT industry are aligned directly with our strategy to become the best cloud company through our HP GreenLake platform offering.  The edge is creating new sources of data. Our customers need secure connectivity to power emerging distributed enterprise with remote workforces while delivering new digital experience to their stakeholders. The world is hybrid, cloud is an experience that customers increasingly expect to have wherever their worlds live. The result is a growing demand for multi-cloud experiences including clouds that live on premises at the edge in colocation or in a public cloud. We have entered the age of insight in data is the most precious asset. Digital transformation is creating new possibilities for enterprises, and customer needs solution to extract insights from the data to accelerate business outcomes.  And when customers tell us they want to address this market shift, they are increasingly looking to do so through a flexible as-a-service consumption model that enables them to pay only for the IT they use. Customers seeking to capitalize on these market trends opportunities are turning to HP GreenLake as the platform of choice. As always Tarek will provide details about the business results for each of our segments.  I will note a few highlights that underscore our performance this quarter, as well as our innovation interaction with customers. Customers a requirement for a unified operating experience across edge-to-cloud and the desire to consume IT in a flexible way is fueling the tremendous or this growth of our HP GreenLake edge-to-cloud age, which saw record demand in Q1 with as-a-service orders of 136% year-over-year. During the quarter, we ordered more than 100 new HP GreenLake customers, bringing the total count to more than now 1,350 customers who have adopted the HP GreenLake platform because of its compelling value proposition. On the new HP GreenLake customers, we announced in Q1 was Barclays, which is using HP GreenLake to deliver his private cloud platform as a part of the bank's hybrid multi-cloud strategy and digital transformation across its global banking businesses.  The traction we are seeing in the market for HP GreenLake is driving us to further accelerate the transformation of HPE into a national cloud company. On March 22, we will unveil significant new innovations and enhancements to our HP GreenLake platform to help customers manage their hybrid clouds more easily protect and get more value from the data and securely connect at the edge. Our as-a-service transformation is my number one priority, and it is already delivering results for our shareholders as evidenced in our Q1 performance and increase non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year 2022.  Our as-a-service favorite is accelerating momentum and key growth businesses. Our intelligent edge business segment grew revenues 11% year-over-year and for the fourth consecutive quarter, so year-over-year over this growth of over 35%, driven by the very strong demand in secure connectivity from edge-to-cloud. Our Aruba Edge cloud offerings continue to drive new customers. The Aruba Central Cloud native cloud platform now manages more than 120,000 customers and more than 1.9 million network devices.  In Q1, we announced that our Aruba Cloud managed branch offering is being adopted by Brasfield & Gorrie, one of the largest privately held construction companies in the United States. The company is using our networking portfolio to elevate their construction site innovation with impressive tools like virtual reality views of projects before they are built. Also in the quarter, we introduced the Aruba Edge Connect Microbranch, an industry leading home office cloud based networking solution that lets remote personnel work seamlessly and securely wherever they are located. Our High Performance Compute and AI business also generate a noteworthy product or the growth of more than 20% year-over-year, which has increased our total order book to a record of approximately $2.7 billion.  During the quarter we announced a win with the United States Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Laboratory to build a new supercomputers that will advance R&D for tomorrow's clean energy systems. Our computer storage businesses experienced robust or the growth and outstanding profitability. In Q1, nearly 10% of computer stores large orders were sold as a service. Compute generated more than 20% or the growth year-over-year, expanded the gross margins and attractive operating margins up 240 basis points year-over-year driven by strong pricing discipline.  Storage growth product order growth are more than 15% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter. Innovation is unrelenting, as we transform this segment into data services business. For example, in Q1 or venture arm Hewlett Packard Pathfinder invested in BigID. This is a leading data intelligent platform to help organizations realize detailed insights in their sensitive personal and critical data and then act on it. Our HPE Pointnext Services team is helping customers navigate through their multi-generational IT journey while modernizing building and running the new hybrid IT space. In Q1 HP Pointnext Services orders increased mid-single digits year-over-year.  Turning to our workforce, we reopened all of our United States offices last month to those who wish to return after careful analysis of information and guidance from the public health officials. I was very pleased to meet team members in-person at a new cutting-edge Houston headquarters. You may have caught a glimpse of a Houston campus innovation in the video that ran before this call. We look forward to the official grand opening in April.  Alongside advancing rewarding workplaces, I also believe that HP has a responsibility to become a more climate resilient company. And we know it is a priority for our customers and shareholders. HPE Financial Services plays an important role in our sustainability strategy, providing asset upcycling to customers, which means reuse of millions of technology assets while freeing up capital for customers to reinvest in their businesses. Customers are choosing HPE in part because of our portfolio sustainability attributes. In fact, in fiscal year 2021, we drove nearly $900 million in revenue from sustainability related customers engagements.  I am proud of our team members not just for bringing breakthrough customer centric innovation, but for how they're bringing it to market. They are making bold moves to maximize what we can do for our customers and shareholders. It is this type of collaboration and engagement as compelling of business transformation. It is clear from strong customer feedback and momentum across our businesses that HPE is increasingly well positioned to capitalize on the edge-to-cloud mega trends that define our IT industry. HP GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to pivot the company and it is generating record breaking demand with impressive profitability across our business. This continues to be uncertain times. As we monitor the dynamic global stage, I am more confident than ever about our future and our ability to drive long term sustainable profitable growth for our shareholders because of our strategy and differentiated innovation.  Now I would let Tarek to talk you through the quarter\u2019s performance in detail. Tarek? Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on slide one. So now let me discuss our Q1 performance details starting with Slide 2.  We're off to a good start delivering against our commitments for fiscal year \u201922 with strong momentum continuing to build across the business. The demand continues to be robust for our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, marking our third quarter in a row with order growth at or above 20% year-over-year. This bolsters our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year \u201822 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 securities analyst meeting.  We delivered Q1 revenues of $7 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in-line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality, despite a continuously challenging supply environment. As a result, our backlog further increased to record levels with a firm order book that shows no signs of double ordering, or any noticeable cancellations. We were particularly pleased with the quality of our earnings including the resiliency of our gross margins, despite the ongoing supply constraints that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 33.9%, up 90 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin, software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margin has also been resilient at 11%, slightly down 30 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially. We're achieving all of the expected savings from our cost actions announced mid-pandemic while continuing to make investments in our high growth, margin rich areas of our portfolio to fuel further revenue and profitability.  Within other income and expense, we benefited from further strong gains related to increased valuations in our investment portfolio and robust operational performance in HPC. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year '22 to be an income of approximately $25 million versus prior guidance of a $20 million to $40 million expense. As a result of our strength in margins that more than offset the continued supply challenges, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.53, well above the high-end of our outlook range of $0.42 to $0.50 for Q1. As previously indicated, we expect the free cash flow to be in-line with our typical seasonality that is lowest in Q1, with a use of cash of $577 million for this quarter. We also continue to take strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. Our inventory is now up $2.5 billion year-over-year to $5.3 billion in support of the substantial order book that we have. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow. Finally, we continued to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in April. We also repurchased $129 million in shares during Q1, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide 3 highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We made meaningful progress during Q1. We added more than 100 customers and well over $500 million of total contract value that brings the current total TCV to more than $6.5 billion. Total as-a-service orders were up 136% year-over-year. As a proof point of our as-a-service pivot momentum as a service order growth has accelerated every quarter going back to Q1 of last year.  Our ARR was up 23% year-over-year to $798 million with supply constraints limiting some installations. While our ARR growth might be somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong rate accelerated -- accelerating order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '24, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continue to increase to 64% in Q1, up more than 4 points year-over-year. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on Slide 4. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions continued unabated with orders growing more than 35% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter. Despite increasing supply constraints, revenue grew 11% year-over-year with strength across the portfolio. Both wired switching and wireless LAN grew approximately 10% with Aruba Services up even stronger driven by our Edge-as-a-Service offerings up strong double digits.  We also delivered strong operating margins of 17.4%, this is a 650 basis point sequential improvement despite higher component and logistics costs, demonstrating that our price actions are sticking. In HPC and AI, demand remains robust with product order growth of more than 20% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of approximately $2.7 billion. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year, but was impacted by two large customer acceptance delays that impacted growth by more than 10 points in Q1 and are now on track to be delivered in Q2. Our Q1 operating profit was obviously also impacted by these pushouts, and we expect operating margins to return to more in range with historical levels going forward. In compute, order growth was up over 20% year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was flat, reflecting the difficult supply environment. We have been very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.8%, up 240 basis points year-over-year and 440 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target of 11% to 13%.  Within storage, product order growth was up in the high teens year-over-year. This was the fourth quarter in a row of 15% or better year-over-year product order growth. Revenue was down 3%, reflecting increasing supply constraints, particularly for our owned IP products. As a result, we had an unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter. We expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we continue to shift our portfolio towards higher-margin products and supply constraints ease. With respect to Pointnext Operational Services, including storage services, orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported similar to levels for total fiscal year '21. As you know, this is a very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 11% year-over-year, and revenue was down 1%. Our write-offs as a percentage of assets, excluding the impact of two frauds in the UK and Asia Pacific was 47 basis points, which is below pre-pandemic levels. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value's realization and lower borrowing costs as we continue to securitize our U.S. portfolio via the ABS market. Our operating margin was 12.4%, up 260 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.7% remains well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can clearly see the strong rebound from last year and sustained momentum entering fiscal year '22, and this despite a more supply-constrained environment versus a year ago. We are also delivering a better quality of earnings with our portfolio mix continuing to shift to our higher growth and higher margin execute our edge-to-cloud strategy. Turning to Slide 6. We delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q1 of 33.9%, up both year-over-year and sequentially despite all of the increased component and logistic costs. This was driven by both strong pricing discipline and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business. Moving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 11%, representing a 130 basis point sequential increase. We also delivered roughly the same operating profit versus last year despite a more challenging supply environment while continuing to invest significantly more in both R&D and our go-to-market for the future, thanks to a much better quality of earnings and gross margins. Turning to Slide 8. Our free cash flow was a use of cash of $577 million. This is more aligned to our typical pre-pandemic seasonality if you look at Q1 in fiscal year '20 or the prior years. Cash flow in Q1 of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we have strategically continued building inventory levels. This will better position us to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash in the back half of the year, reflecting also our typical seasonality. We, therefore, continue to expect to deliver fiscal year '22 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 9. Given our strong performance in Q1 and building momentum across the business, I am pleased to announce that we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net EPS outlook range for fiscal year '22 by $0.07 at the midpoint to $2.03 to $2.17.  From a top-line perspective, we were very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond. We do also want to remain prudent in the short term given the ongoing supply challenges that we continue to believe will likely last well into the second half of the calendar year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year '22 revenue outlook of growth of 3% to 4% and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year '23. More specifically, for Q2 2022, we expect revenue to be in-line with our normal sequential seasonality of down low to mid-single digits and are comfortable with current consensus. As a result, for Q2 '22, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.18 to $0.26 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.41 to $0.49. So overall, I am very pleased with our first quarter of fiscal year '22. Our edge-to-cloud strategy is resonating with customers and driving strong demand across our portfolio. This enabled us to deliver a good start to the fiscal year with increasing momentum and a raised outlook. We are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session.  our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to maybe dig a little bit more into linearity during the quarter and what you're hearing from customers in terms of demand given all the geopolitical challenges. You talked about backlog increasing to record levels. I'm wondering, how much of that do you think our customers planning ahead? Or thinking about longer lead times versus near-term demand that's not just being able to be met right now?  And I don't know, just what are you hearing because are customers sort of shifting the way that they think about how they're buying at this point in time? And I guess just the final sort of question within that is, how does this benefit or does it benefit your GreenLink and your as-a-service strategy? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Shan. So as you can imagine, I spend a lot of time talking to customers. In fact, 50% of my time is with customers and partners. And the one consistent theme is that we said in our quarter has 13 weeks and every week has been super strong. We put specific goals for our sales force every week that we track very closely. Tarek runs a very tight process on that. And we have always exceeded every week's forecast.  And the feedback is driven by the following : number one, obviously, we know digital transformation is getting stronger and stronger out there, and it's driven by the fact that you've got to digitize your process to be competitive. And number two, data continue to explode everywhere, and that means that they need more capacity to store the data, but most importantly, process that data at the pace we haven't seen before. And that's a combination of AI, analytics, deep learning at scale and obviously, a lot of compute power. The third piece, obviously, as I said in my remarks, is that the edge continue to grow very, very rapidly. And in order to transform in a digital environment, you need connectivity. Without being connected, you don't have the on-ramp through this digital transformation. Of course, customers are concerned about inflationary costs going forward. They monitor what's happening out there. And -- but in the end, I think all of this, when you balance the demand for these trends, and I talk about the trends, right, in the megatrends. And then the fact that customers want to consume more flexibly don't want to put all that CapEx to work, GreenLake is getting significant attention.  And that's why I said when I think about the future of this company, the product is HPE GreenLake. Everything gets delivered through HPE GreenLake, whether it's a connectivity through a subscription model, whether it's computer storage that you can consume elastically with data services running on top of it, whether it's the services to operate in a HPE GreenLake, HPE GreenLake is becoming a platform of choice for many customers because offers that flexibility and in an architecture that's edge-to-cloud. And that's inclusive, by the way, of the public cloud. And that's why when you see the innovation we're going to bring in the next 2 weeks, it includes the public cloud in the way we manage that. So overall, I will say, great execution by our team. Customers need more IT now more than ever. And obviously, we are doing a good job, I will say, in the quality of earnings, pricing elasticity and everything we have done, which is the results of the profitability you saw in Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you, Shannon. Appreciate the question. Operator, can we have the next one, please? Operator : Your next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Congrats on the really solid gross margin performance in a very tough environment where others are really seeing a lot of pressure on their GP dollars and gross margins. I was hoping you can talk about the sustainability of these gross margins through the rest of the year, especially in light of the increasing DRAM and NAND cost? And it seems as though some of the logistics are really not letting up so far?  And maybe you can share some color on your ability to take incremental price actions and maybe share some color on what you've already been able to pass through in terms of pricing? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Wamsi, thank you for the questions. Yes, indeed, I'm very pleased with our gross margin performance this quarter, and we outperformed our competitors. It's pretty obvious when you look at what they have reported. And the resiliency of our gross margin is there for everyone to see and this despite the ongoing supply constraints that everyone has been facing with.  So we feel that this performance can be sustained, but the -- you have to adopt different pricing strategies across different segments. So we have to be incredibly dynamic in our compute segment that we have been, and this translates into significant operating profit margins at 13.8%, which is even higher than the long-term outlook that we put forward for that segment at SAM 2021. And in the rest of our portfolio, we have significant differentiation at the edge, in storage also in HPE Financial Services and HPC. So there, the pricing strategy is different. We take harder look at how much value can extract given that our portfolio there is more differentiated. But it's -- everyone is contributing here to making sure that the gross margins are sustainable. Finally I want to highlight to you that as-a-service contributes and will continue to contribute in the long run to enhance gross margins. That's why we highlighted to you all on the -- in the slide presentation, the mix shift in the composition of the ARR. The more we continue to drive as-a-service growth, the better it is for gross margins ultimately.  But it's a dynamic environment. And to your point, you will see some pressure on some commodities. We feel we are well equipped with our inventory levels to withstand the pressure from these commodities. And this is why we buffered up inventory to the levels that we reported knowing that this is obviously to meet a substantial order book that is much higher than what we have experienced in prior years. As Antonio said, the demand in the quarter has been surprise us from its strength and resiliency standpoint. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you Wamsi for the question. Operator, can we have the next one, please? Operator : Your next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Yeah, I was hoping to just follow up on some of the as-a-service business and deals. You mentioned getting some large deals and more backlog building there. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the complexion of what you're seeing from a solution set or a customer base driving that? And maybe a little bit on kind of what you see from pipeline on some of the customers looking to more take on the as-a-service type of offering as opposed to just kind of the standard of the build and buy? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. Well, one of the marquee customers is actually your bank, Barclays, quite interesting. They needed a partner to take them to this hybrid journey. And in their case, they have tens and tens of thousands of VMs. So in their case, they wanted flexibility to scale up and down in a private cloud environment and yet integrate the public cloud as they go forward.  So they felt that, obviously, with GreenLake, they get the best of both words, an experience and a cost on-prem that's very competitive and ability to move VMs back and forth as they need. But the reality is that, that is driven by many factors. Number one, let's start with the edge, right? So obviously, a lot of the as-a-service now at the edge is done in a subscription model. You subscribe to the Aruba Cloud Platform now inside GreenLake. And then basically, you can provision connectivity with a few clicks.  But now we are seeing growth in what we call the NaaS environment, the Network-as-a-Service, where customers don't just want the subscription, but they want the full consumption, including the hardware and services in a managed services approach. They don't want to be in what I call the day 2 of the run part. So that comes with a lot of services. And that's why Tarek mentioned the combination of software and services is increasing. If you look at the colocation or the edge, where the cloud is moving as well, or datacenter, obviously, private cloud is one aspect, is that infrastructure-as-a-service component. But a lot is also world load optimized solutions, whether it's what else like VDI or whether it's SAP-as-a-Service, or Machine Learning as a Service. So we see existing workloads and new loads also being consumed as a service in these locations. So those are the type of deals And remember, it's not just the hardware and software, it's the services that comes with it because what we're seeing our customers, and we talked about some of the previous customers as well, they want HPE to run their solution end-to-end, which the managed services piece come as well with it. So it's a combination of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, connectivity and then as well, this world load optimization with more and more management as well as a hybrid estate, which includes the public cloud. And last but not least, obviously, if you think about data. Data is a major component. Data has a gravitational force. And at the same time, they want to apply these new techniques. That's why we see a lot of growth in the AI machine lending space. Both in the enterprise space and at scale through HPC. And that's why on the HPC side, we are very, very pleased with the momentum. As we know, that business becomes a little bit lumpy because of the customer acceptances. But this year, we're going to deliver some of the most amazing systems you can imagine at massive scale, where customers can process data we have not imagined before.  So it's a combination of all things that's what resulted in 136% growth. And that's why we are very excited about the momentum. But what excites me the most, honestly, is the innovation we're going to continue to bring in the platform called HPE GreenLake. And to the question that Shannon asked me earlier, that's why it's my priority number one, because it's working, it's driving more growth in the bookings and better profitability. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Tim for the question. Operator, next one, please? Operator : The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. I wanted to dig into the intelligent edge upside. You noted that order growth was still stronger than the revenue growth that you guys were able to post. And so kind of two parts of the question are just is some of the order growth that you're seeing still kind of return to office plans? Are we really starting to kind of move past this return to office-driven growth? And then on the second piece, just on the revenue upside that you were able to post, is that some kind of loosening of availability for networking chips? Or is there anything that led to kind of outperformance in that segment or losing the supply chain in that segment more than others? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Sure. Well, thank you for the question. And I will start and Tarek can add on. If you go back to 2018, when I became CEO, I said that the edge is the next frontier, and we will invest in innovation over the next 40 years. We are now seeing the results of that investment because we have a unique value proposition in as-a-service model that actually is accelerating our momentum there. And you saw the numbers, right, 35% growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. This is not just a data point in the chart, there is four of them in the data in the chart that they are driving strong demand. I think the pandemic has accelerated the need for that distributed connectivity. In fact, this quarter, we announced a new offer, the Edge Connect offer, which basically gives the customer the ability to manage the workforce wherever they are in a seamless, secure, integrated way and provision their connectivity wherever they are. But listen, the scale or the platform we have, I think is unmatched. We already have more than 120,000 customers, which are consuming more and more services. They may start with Wi-Fi. They are in LAN, now they're in WAN. That's why we made the acquisition of Silver Peak more than 15 months ago. And soon, we're going to add 5G too. So in my view, this is just a buildup momentum. And the architecture of that business is about unification of the connectivity, which makes it simpler to run, the operations, the network operations, whatever that connectivity is, the security layer, which obviously is super important and then the analytics, because ultimately what customers like about our offer is the ability to use the data that we actually can provide through the network on performance and characteristics that allows that allows them to deliver a better experience.  And when you have almost 2 million devices, there is a lot of datapoints. In fact, so you know the scale every hour, we process almost 2 billion datapoints. And that's done around the globe in 13 different geos. And that gives the ability of the customer to provide these unique experiences. But again, that comes also with an improvement in operating margins, which is 17.4%, which is actually sequentially at 650 basis points.  I think on the supply, obviously, we have been working for some time. I can tell you we are -- we continue to place orders at least four, if not five quarters ahead of demand because we are so confident about this business to continue to grow. And, we have to work through sometimes, we get a little bit better matching to what we have sometimes, we may live some orders unconverted. But on the long term, this is going to continue to be a shiny story for us. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thank you for the question, Meta. Can we go to the next one, please, operator? Operator : The next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. I have a couple of questions on the ARR side, ARR didn't grow on a sequential basis for the first time in a while. I know you talked about supply challenges, limiting some of the installations. Is there a seasonality element to the ARR growth? That's question number one. And secondly, GreenLake Services growth continued to accelerate more than double for the second consecutive quarter. Can you walk us through how long it takes for GreenLake orders to flow into the ARR calculation? I assume it's different for every business segment. Thanks. Antonio Neri : So let me start, and I'm sure the last part of the question, Tarek will answer how long it takes. No, I don't think there's any seasonality. This is up to the right. And it's just a matter of getting those installations completed. Sometime it's the supply, sometimes it's the customer readiness in some cases. But the reality is all driven by the availability of the systems for us to install. So that's the answer on that. But again, because of the momentum we have there, we are very confident on that 35% to 45% CAGR that we committed. And obviously, over time, this takes care of itself.  So that's on that part of the question. I don't see an issue at all.  The services piece I think you just mentioned -- I mentioned it before, right. As with GreenLake, the one important part is it comes with 100%, attach rates of Pointnext services. And as we go forward, obviously, that momentum continued to build a bigger, kind of deferred aspect of it. And at the same time, we also added the managed services piece of it, because many of the new deals we have been engaging. There was a question earlier about the pipeline, the pipeline looks amazingly strong, in some very large marquee deals in the making.  But with that said, the managed services piece is an additive to the attach because customers don't want to be in the in the round time anymore. So they are aligned, the GreenLake as a platform plus the services under needs to run their operations.  So maybe, Tarek, you want to talk about the conversion into ARR I think it is? Tarek Robbiati : Yeah. So I mean, the simple answer to your question on how long does it take to see an order flow into the ARR and revenue terms is this. Our GreenLake model is an appliance-driven model, where effectively you have a complete stack from standard hardware platforms with services and software on top.  And so to the extent that we have to deliver that complete stack solution, it takes -- obviously, it's important that we deliver the right hardware to be able to start to recognize the revenue. By the moment we deliver the appliance and the revenue flows based on the contract duration, and we have flagged to you and possibly to -- in prior occasions that the services revenue, which makes the bulk of the ARR with the software is recognized overtime over the duration of the contract. And the contract duration varies between 36 and up to 55-58 months, in some cases, 60 months.  And so this is why it takes time to develop the ARR. But the really important thing to note is the size of the total contract value that we have on the balance sheet. So if you really look at the contract value that we have on the balance sheet, we increased it by $500 million in this quarter, taking the total to $6.5 that will unwind in the upcoming, say, 60 months at the worst. So that's the dynamic that you have here in terms of orders versus revenue and ARR recognition. Antonio Neri : Which is a great question because, obviously, if you look at our ARR, again, at $800 million this quarter. And our total contract value $6.5 billion and more than 64% now is software and services. Overtime, you will see the impact it has on our results, both quality of the revenue mix and quality of the earnings because as Tarek said, obviously, everything we do through GreenLake is accretive. And so that's why we are excited about the momentum we have on GreenLake. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Sidney for the question. Operator, next one please? Operator : Your next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And congrats on the results. I guess I wanted to kind of frame you -- how you're thinking about the full year revenue of guidance at 3% to 4% relative to the backlog build. So if I look at the revenue guidance at the midpoint, it would seem to suggest you expect a stronger second half relative to what we've seen over the past few years, second half versus first half.  So I guess my question is what's your assumptions around backlog build? And when maybe we see that peak and you start to ship against that backlog, is that factored into your revenue growth expectation from this year? Antonio Neri : Great question. And I think if you think about it in Q1, right? So we grew orders 20% and revenue 2%. It means that we're growing orders 10 times faster than the revenue. And so that's the simple message there. But the reality is that, obviously, we said that the supply will challenge that we see. And by the way, logistics, right, which obviously comes with other issues will be well into the second half of '22. So this is a matter of timing more than anything else. And definitely, we said -- we feel very good about the 3% to 4% revenue, but it's going to depend to that ability to get the supply that we need in the right time, in the right mix. Remember, we have a very large portfolio. Not all orders are created equal to the point that Tarek made earlier. And then we see. Obviously, as we go through, we're going to assess what else may happen there. But definitely, it's just a timing issue at this point in time, more than anything else.  And we expect that to get better as we go along. But the message that you imply that second half will be higher, absolutely. There is no question about it. The question is how high depending on the ability to convert the backlog. I will say the backlog right now in Q1 is bigger than Q4. And Tarek and I believe that backlog has not peaked. And also remember on the backlog, we have a lot of HPC systems, which, in some cases, by the way, have already been built and delivered. But it takes several months to get it running, which basically until you run the payload and the world load and some of them need to go what I call the top 100 HCL --HPL kind of testing. You are now going to get the acceptance. So that's why, maybe a quarter, you're going to have a huge acceptance and this will happen. Well, that's will happen is the acceptance of some of the system. And Tarek talked about two systems that slipped from Q1 into Q2. So you got all these dynamics. But definitely, second half will be better and then hopefully carries on into '23 because the demand is still super strong. Tarek Robbiati : Yeah. Aaron, if I can add to Antonio's answer. When we gave guidance at SAM, we told you all that we are targeting 3% to 4% revenue growth in fiscal year '22 with the second half of the year counting for more than the first half of the year. Nothing has changed to that picture. If anything, the order strength is greater than what we anticipated at SAM, and it surprised us somewhat in because -- and I just want to remind you what Antonio said in his first answer to the first question, orders have been strong for 13 weeks in Q1. And so when you really look at what's happening on two fronts : first, on our inventory levels, we are acquiring substantial amounts of inventory to cater for the strength of the order demand. And so if you also look at what the delta is between order growth and revenue growth, as Antonio said, we're clearly not at peak backlog. That is going to continue. It bodes well for fiscal year '22 and for fiscal year '23 as well. Finally, the thing I want to highlight to you is the impact of foreign exchange rates. When we were together at SAM in October, we mentioned that we were expecting 50 basis points of headwind due to foreign exchange rates. Now obviously, the situation is slightly different. The dollar is stronger, and we expect a full point headwind of 50 basis points. But yes, we are comfortable reiterating the 3% to 4% top line revenue growth, because of the strength of the order book.  So hopefully you can see the link between orders in revenue, orders backlog inventory built up and ultimate revenue guidance that we give on a constant currency basis. Andrew Simanek : Great, thanks. Appreciate the question. Operator, next one, please? Operator : The next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have to ask a free cash flow question now. I guess, Tarek, down $600 million free cash flow or thereabouts, it's somewhat more severe than what I would think normal seasonality should be. So maybe you can just flesh out how much of this you think is seasonal versus perhaps things driven by working capital inefficiencies and there's a big spike or drop in these other assets and liabilities, maybe you can just start what happened there as well. And then importantly, as I go through the year, do I think about April being somewhat more muted in free cash flow as well and in the back half being better? Or what does that cadence look like? Antonio Neri : Okay. So Tarek? Tarek Robbiati : Okay. So a couple of things on -- to on to your question. First of all, the negative $577 million free cash flow is mainly driven by working capital. If you really look at the buildup in inventory, we now have $5.3 billion of inventory. This has had an adverse impact on the cash flow conversion cycle. And so our cash flow conversion cycle is a positive 20 days, which is an increase of 17 days relative to the prior quarter because we're stocking up inventory given the order demand and the order book that we have. So that's a main driver. Is it seasonal relative to the prior years, yes, but not fiscal year \u201821? You have to go back to the first quarter of fiscal year '20 and prior years to determine free cash flow seasonality moving forward. But we feel good about our ability to generate free cash flow as we work through the backlog and reduce the inventory levels. And this is why we reaffirmed the free cash flow guide of $1.8 billion to $2 billion for fiscal year '22. There was another part of your question, which I forgot, I think you were talking about the movement in other assets and liabilities. Andy would want to take that one, please? Andrew Simanek : Yeah, so that's generally related to our comp plans where we pay out our bonus in the first quarter. So that's one of the reasons why if you look at our typical seasonality. As Tarek said, going back to fiscal year \u201920, a year before, you'll generally see Q1 is always a use of cash.  Great. Well, thank you, Amit. I appreciate the question. I think operator, we have time for one more, please. Operator : Our final question will come from Kyle McNeely with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle McNealy : Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. Great job on the results in such a difficult environment for everyone else. We have some recent survey work that we did that shows enterprises are expecting a higher-than-normal level of refresh activity in the coming year, specifically for servers and storage. We assume that some of that might be catch-up on upgrading aging infrastructure coming out of the pandemic. But are you seeing that type of activity come through in helping the results? And what would be your expectation for refresh and upgrade activity for the balance of the year 2022? Antonio Neri : Sure, Kyle. Yeah. Of course, customers are now thinking about what else they need to succeed in this new environment. Definitely, the pandemic put a halt on their expenses because, obviously, at the beginning of pandemic, everybody was in preservation mode, on liquidity. But at the same time, I think there is a component of modernization, which I call it better than refresh. And also the need to deploy these new technologies. It's not anymore about a cloud mandate. It's about what they're going to do with that data. Because cloud is just a means to the end, right? It's all about accelerating speed and agility. But what customers are looking also is what type of things they need to do with that data.  So it\u2019s a combination of data exploring, connectivity required in this digital world and the fact that you need to stay up to these new ways to deliver IT, while the transition this journey to the multigenerational IT. Because many of these customers have a lot of complexity. They have legacy assets that they have a lot of data with applications that are not really replatform. They cannot replatform. They are older ones that, honestly, they need to, what I call, cloudify, but most importantly, we need to deploy these new technologies around data. So that's why our vision to become the edge-to-cloud platform company is so spot on. Because it's aligned to those megatrends of connectivity, cloud and data that you can consume as-a-service. And that's why the future of the company long-term is GreenLake, is that a product that drives the rest of the portfolio with higher margins and obviously, more recurring revenues for us and for our shareholders. Andrew Simanek : Well, great. Thank you, Kyle for the question and everybody else participating. Antonio maybe I\u2019ll turn it back to you for some closing remarks. Antonio Neri : Yeah. So obviously, very pleased with the Q1 performance, solid start. Again, the quarter was characterized by the customer demand, very robust customer demand and very strong profitability. I think it's showing the strength of our strategy and in differentiated portfolio innovation.  I think we're very well positioned against the strengths, as Kyle just ask at the end. But obviously, we live in interesting times, right? So -- and right now, we have to be vigilant about that. Our priority is to continue to execute on our commitments and also make sure we can contribute to the society as a whole because this company has a unique value and culture.  So proud of not only what we deliver, but how we deliver. So I hope you stay safe and well. And hope to speak to you soon. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Well thank you, Andy and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today's earnings call. HPE's second quarter results reflect significant customer traction for our differentiated portfolio and underscore our progress in becoming the edge-to-cloud company. The macroeconomic environment of the last few months has presented enterprises around the world with strategic challenges that are usually not confronted all at once. The market shifts have certainly created a dynamic backdrop for our global customers and have made it harder for them to realize their goals in the short-term. But more than ever, organizations need technology partners to help them weather challenges, while successfully digitizing and transforming their businesses in order to increase their market competitiveness. HPE's ability to address these customer needs was key to our performance in the second quarter. Once again, HPE generated significant orders growth, steady revenue, and sustained profitability, even as tight supply conditions continued across global industries. We are seeing persistent demand from our customers, underscoring both their IT spending prioritization and the attraction to our compelling portfolio. Very strong customer demand in the second quarter drove orders growth higher, rising 20% year-over-year, which makes this the fourth quarter in a row that HP has logged year-over-year orders growth of 20% or better. Our HPE GreenLake H2 Cloud platform contributed to as-a-service orders doubling year-over-year, the third straight quarter of triple-digit growth. We continue to see a great deal of customer interest in our platform, which is evident in our sales pipeline. Our orders backlog across the business is high quality, and we are now -- we are seeing particular strength in our Intelligent Edge and Compute segments, with orders climbing 45% and 23%, respectively. HPC and AI orders grew more than 18%, bringing backlog there to an impressive record of approximately $3 billion. Total HPE revenue rose 1.5% year-over-year to $6.7 billion against a record break in backlog of orders in the midst of industry supply constraints. ARR climbed 25%. We have momentum across the portfolio with our as-a-service model differentiating us. This quarter, though, through a combination of supply constraints, limiting our ability to fulfill orders as well as some areas where we could have executed better, we did not fully translated the strong customer orders into higher revenue growth. I am confident that we have identified where we can strengthen and expect continued improvement as we move into the back half of the year. Importantly, the quarter's biggest standout, even if we were somewhat limited by supply chain, is that we maintained non-GAAP gross margins of 34%, thanks to disciplined execution and timely pricing actions. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.44, which together with our Q1 results, makes the first half of 2022, the second strongest EPS half year performance at HPE on a continuing operations basis. As Tarek will detail for you, we are reaffirming our full year outlook of revenue growth of 3% to 4% and our long-term 2024 revenue CAGR outlook. We are also reaffirming our full fiscal year free cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. As announced in February, we suspended all shipments to and sales in Russia and Belarus. We have now determined that it's no longer tenable for us to maintain operations in these countries. Therefore, today, we are announcing the closing of our operations in both countries and we'll proceed with an orderly managed exit. Our business in these countries represents less than 2% of HPE's total revenue in fiscal year 2021. We have booked $126 million pre-tax charge related to the impact of Russia to our business, which is included in our second quarter GAAP earnings per share results. We expect less significant additional charges in the third quarter related to winding down these operations, partially to reflect this necessary action and partially to unfavorable foreign exchange movement, we are updating our full fiscal year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to between $1.96 to $2.10, which is the guidance we provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting last October. In the short term, we recognize the supply and logistics constraints, rising inflation and evolving economic and geopolitical conditions are all contributing to a dynamic environment. However, enterprise demand continues to persist across our entire portfolio. We are focused on translating the demand we see in the market and a high-quality backlog into profitable growth, while continuing to closely manage our inventory position. When even the supply of low-value components can be hard to secure in today's environment, we will continue to be disciplined and prudent in our decision-making to deliver on our commitments. As we look to the future, we are strengthening the scale and resilience of our supply chain, including opening a new factory in the Czech Republic for next-generation HPC and AI technologies, which will help us address the very solid demand we have for these specialized solutions. There is no question that we have positioned HPE well to help our customers double down on digital transformation. HPE GreenLake is at the center of our strategy to deliver edge to cloud solutions to enable customers data first modernization strategies. I hope many of you will join us later this month to see firsthand how our strategy comes to life when we host HPE Discover live in Las Vegas for the first time in three years. We will have a lot to show you as it has been an exciting few months for our customers and for HPE. In March, we announced features on HPE GreenLake that deliver greater choice and simplicity. We added 12 new cloud native services with now more than the total of 50 cloud new services available through the platform. We also continue to expand our partner ecosystem, increasing the number of partners actively selling HP GreenLake this quarter by more than 50% from the same period last year. In addition, partners who sold multiple HPE GreenLake deals in the quarter increased by 2.5 times year-over-year. At the edge, our capabilities are high demand as organizations need to securely connect distributed workforces and create engaging experiences. We are focused on delivering cloud-native services that can more easily embed intra automated networks to absorb evolving networking configurations. And with the convergence of Aruba Central and HPE GreenLake, more than 120,000 Aruba customers now have access to the HPE GreenLake platform. As customers adopt hybrid multi-class solutions, we know they also need a secure and flexible on-premises cloud solution. We were recently selected as the prime provider for Google's cloud distributed hosted solution. HPE GreenLake will enable Google to deliver an on-premises cloud experience for organization with strict data residency, security, and privacy requirements. Our hybrid cloud offerings have attracted nearly 150 new customers in Q2, including BMW Group, who is using HPE GreenLake to streamline and unify the company's data management across its global locations in the cloud and Worldline, the world's fourth largest provider who chose HPE GreenLake to implement their major performance upgrade to its payment platform as it continues to deliver against a cashless economy vision. HPE Financial Services had a unique hand in the Worldline upgrade to HPE GreenLake, with our asset renewal program funding approximately 25% of the refresh. From a data perspective, we continue to make meaningful enhancement that allow customers to extract more insights from their data to accelerate business outcomes. For instance, we are creating sophisticated AI models to generate and share insights in distributed environments. In April, we introduced HPE Swarm Learning, which enables users to share learnings through an AI model at the edge and from distinct sites without compromising data privacy. One university in Germany is already using in HPE Swarm Learning to more accurately diagnose colon cancer by applying AI learnings that can predict cancerous genetic alterations. And early this week, Frontier, an HPE designed and built system became the world's first and the fastest exascale supercomputer, taking the number one ranking on the world's top 500 list of supercomputers, exceeding the 1 exaflop performance threshold for the first time. To put this in perspective, this performance is three time faster than the number two super computer. HP has deployed four of the top 10 supercomputers and ranked first, second, third and fourth, on the Green 500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. Our service pivot is also innovative in the way it helps our customers meet their sustainability goals. HPE Relay helped customers reduce their carbon footprint by more than 30% versus traditional IT models. Later this month, when we release our Living Progress Report, we will share more about our efforts to support our customers' goals, while pushing ourselves in the industry to improve our own. Few of us could have predicted that the challenges of the last several years would require enterprises to adopt so dramatically. I spent at least 50% of my time with customers around the world, and I can tell you that when they think about how they are going to reimagine their futures, they see HPE as an even more relevant innovation partner than ever before. As I reflect on Q2 and look ahead to the future, I am confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments. We have the right strategy to capitalize on market trends, with an expansive edge-to-cloud portfolio that's connected through our market-leading HPE GreenLake platform. We have significant momentum with our customers. And perhaps most importantly, we have been -- we have a truly stellar team. I am proud of the 60,000 team members who make our results possible and who help us deliver on our purpose as a company. This team will continue to innovate and execute in ways that will further set us apart and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Tarek to walk you through the details of our business segment results and overall performance. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1 and 2. So now let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 3. We continue to see robust demand across our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio with order growth up 20% year-over-year, the same as last quarter. This marks our fourth quarter in a row with order growth of 20% or better year-over-year. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting. We delivered Q2 revenues of $6.7 billion, up 1.5% year-over-year and in line with our outlook of normal sequential seasonality and despite a more challenging supply environment that limited upside. The unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China and seizing the support of Russia services contracts impacted our revenue by more than $250 million in the quarter, our total operating margins by more than one point and EPS by approximately $0.06. Given the delta between our order and revenue growth rates, our backlog further increased to new record levels and yet remains very high quality. The order book is firm and most importantly, has been priced to preserve gross margins. We are particularly pleased with the resiliency of our non-GAAP gross margins despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.2%, up 30 basis points sequentially and down just 10 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins were 9.3%, reflecting the revenue impact from incremental supply constraints and our exit from Russia that reduced operating leverage. We expect operating margins to expand in the short term as we drive more leverage from revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin-rich areas of our portfolio. Within other income and expense, we benefited from robust operational performance in H3C and further gains related to increased valuations in our Pathfinder investment portfolio. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP other income and expense for fiscal year 2022 to be an income of approximately $75 million versus prior guidance of an approximately $25 million income. Given our strength in gross margin and despite the approximately $0.06 impact from China and Russia, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44, near the midpoint of our outlook range of $0.41 to $0.49 for Q2. We also delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.19. This includes $126 million of disaster charges related to Russia, primarily consisting of an increased reserve for financing lease assets. With the decision to already exit Russia that we have announced today, we expect to record and less significant GAAP-only charge in Q3 that has been factored into our updated outlook already. As previously indicated, we expected free cash flow to be in line with our normal seasonality that is a use of cash in the first half and Q2 was a use of cash of $211 million. We have made significant investments in working capital during the first half, reflecting our strategic inventory actions to navigate the current supply environment. This will better position us to convert orders into future revenue and cash flow, while working capital is expected to become a tailwind in the second half. Finally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q2 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in July. We also repurchased $58 million in shares, bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $498 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide four highlights key metrics of our growing as-a-service business. We continue to see very strong momentum across our as-a-service portfolio, where we introduced 12 new cloud services this quarter and converge Aruba Central with the HPE GreenLake platform to create a unified operational experience for all users. Total as-a-service orders were up 107% year-over-year, marking the third quarter in a row with orders more than doubling. Our ARR was up 25% year-over-year to $829 million, with supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. While our ARR growth is somewhat volatile in the current supply environment, the strong order growth over the last several quarters is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business. This gives us confidence in delivering our 35% to 45% CAGR target from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024, with increasing margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q2, up more than 5 points year-over-year with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on Slide 5. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, demand for our secure connectivity solutions accelerated with orders growing 45% year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter with growth of more than 35%. Despite increased supply disruptions in China, revenue grew 9% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double-digits. We delivered operating margins of 12.6%, reflecting higher component and logistics costs, resulting in lower operating leverage. We expect margins to improve next quarter with higher levels of revenue that also benefit from previous price actions that are sticking. In HPC and AI, demand remains robust with order growth of 18% year-over-year, driving our awarded contracts total to another record level of just under $3 billion. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year and was impacted by one large customer acceptance delay that impacted growth by more than six points and has now been delivered in Q3.  Importantly, our Q2 operating profit was impacted by the ramp in project costs for a couple of mega deals expected to close by the end of the year that will return operating margins to more in range with historical levels. In Compute, order growth remained robust and was up over 20% year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, while revenue growth was up 1%, reflecting a more difficult supply environment. We continue to be very focused on executing a dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistics cost and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.9%, up 270 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially, well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%. Within Storage, we achieved another record level of product backlog that is skewed towards our owned IP margin-rich products. Revenue was down 2%, reflecting supply constraints for our own IP products. As a result, we continue to have unfavorable revenue mix that pressured our margins this quarter. We expect both our revenue growth rates and margins to improve over the next few quarters as we work through our favorable backlog mix and steer more demand towards our new Electra  and Block Storage offerings. With respect to Pointnext operational services, including storage services, orders again grew mid-single digits year-over-year as reported, similar to levels for total fiscal year 2021. As you know, this is very important for the long-term health of our most profitable business. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 2% year-over-year with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue was flat. Our profitability continues to benefit from higher residual value realization as customers tend to extend the use of their systems in a supply-constrained environment. Our operating margin was 12.6%, up 180 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 20.4% remains well above the 18%-plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide six highlights our revenue and EPS performance where you can see we've maintained relatively constant levels from last year despite incremental supply constraints, in particular, from the China shutdowns and also are seizing to support services contracts in Russia. As a reminder, this combines for more than a $250 million impact to revenue and a one point impact to total operating margins and an approximately $0.06 impact to EPS in Q2. In spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better quality of earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge to Cloud strategy. The improved quality of earnings can be seen on slide seven, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q2 of 34.2% showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we've been driving towards edge and our as-a-service business. Moving to slide eight, you can see our non-GAAP operating margin this quarter of 9.3%, reflecting the reduced operating leverage from supply challenges and our exit from Russia. However, we are achieving much better efficiency in our sales and office investments when measuring productivity on an orders basis. Given our high-quality backlog, we are also continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market for future growth. On slide nine, let's spend some time reminding everyone about our unique setup in China through H3C. As disclosed in an 8-K in late April, we have extended our existing food option that is struck at 15 times trading 12-month earnings through to October 31st, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring, which is proceeding as planned before determining a longer term path forward for our stake. We value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although we will balance prior to execution of any extension, the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. H3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup. Our equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year 2021 and has grown 32% in this Q2 of fiscal year 2022. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer term solution for this valuable asset. Turning to slide 10, our free cash flow was a use of cash of $211 million. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality with the first half being a use of cash followed by strong generation of free cash flow in the second half. The first half of this year has also been uniquely impacted by the supply chain environment as we strategically built inventory levels in Q1 that were flat in Q2. We are taking further strategic actions to improve supply chain visibility and attain operational and financial benefits. This will put us in a better position to begin converting orders and generate healthy amounts of cash as working capital will turn into a tailwind in the back half of the year. We will need to demonstrate strong execution in the second half, but we have a path forward and expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 11. We are revising our fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP outlook range back to our original outlook provided at SAM of $1.96 to $2.10. This reflects the impacts of a more unfavorable currency movements since last October, the exit of the business in Russia, the COVID-related disruptions in China to this date, offset by the other income and expense benefit we've received in the first half. From a top line perspective, we are very pleased with the continued strength in orders and growing backlog that gives us confidence in future revenue growth in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. We do want to remain prudent in the short term, given the ongoing supply challenges that we believe will likely last well into next year. Currency is also expected to now be a two-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points at the start of our fiscal year. As a result, we still have strong confidence in our fiscal year 2022 revenue growth outlook of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency and expect to end the year with elevated levels of backlog, which bodes well for fiscal year 2023. More specifically, for Q3 2022, we expect revenue to be up low single-digits sequentially. This is slightly below our normal seasonality to reflect our expectations that the China shutdowns will have a lingering impact in the short term. As a result, for Q3 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.22 to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.54. So overall, I'm pleased with how we are executing in a strong demand but challenging supply environment during the first half of fiscal year 2022. With our high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing Edge to Cloud opportunity and deliver against all of our financial commitments set at SAM 2021. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Sorry about that, guys. Can you hear me? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, we can Aaron. Antonio Neri : We can. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Yes, sorry. Sorry about that. So I'll start with just the question on the backlog. As you kind of thought about the guidance for the full year and obviously, some moving parts around FX and China, et cetera, but how has your assumptions changed at all with regard to the backlog build? Are you assuming any kind of backlog reduction through the course of this fiscal year? And if not, what's your current views on kind of peaking levels of backlog at this point? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, good afternoon Charles, thank you for the -- Aaron, good afternoon for the question -- thank you for the question with regard to our backlog. I would say our backlog has not peaked yet. When you have four consecutive quarters of 20% growth and the delta between the backlog growth, order growth and the revenue being what it is, the backlog has not peaked and will probably peak towards the end of this fiscal year. Our assumptions on converting that backlog into revenue are contained in the guidance that we gave for this fiscal year of 3% to 4% revenue growth adjusted for currency. I want to reiterate to you that the FX impact in that guidance is a 2% headwind as opposed to a 50 basis point headwind that we originally forecast. Antonio Neri : I would say, Aaron, obviously, we're going to enter 2023 with an elevated backlog, which bodes us well for the future revenue growth of the company. As I said in my remarks, we continue to be very confident in our CAGR outlook that we provided at SAM for the next three years. But obviously, as we go forward, the backlog will be reduced supply and other issues alleviates. And if you think about the 3% to 4% guidance for the year, which is the guidance we provide at SAM versus the 1.5% we just reported, obviously, there will be low single-digit growth sequentially on that revenue. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks for the question, Aaron. Chuck, can we go to the next one, please? Operator : Yes sir. The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could help me get a little bit better insight into what allowed you to basically do better on gross margin than we expected given the input costs and the foreign exchange. What I'm looking for in this question is an understanding of how much of this is about mix? How much of it is about your ability to raise prices and pass that on to customers? And how are you thinking about the outlook for the gross margin given what you've done so far in terms of price increases and what you're thinking about on foreign exchange? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. So, let me try and unpack this for you. So, first of all, when you really look at our business across the various segments, Aruba is continuing to do extremely well and we outperformed the competition, specifically Cisco in the second quarter. And the order book in Aruba is absolutely substantial. As you can observe, Aruba growth -- and you know Aruba comes with higher gross margin, has a favorable impact on the mix. The second thing I would point out to you is with respect to compute, the disciplined pricing actions that we've taken now for several quarters with compute continue to bear fruit. Compute operating profit margins at well above 13%, well above our long-term guidance, have also been better than what our main competitor in that space, Dell, has delivered for their total ISG margins that include compute, storage, and networking. So, compute is performing much, much better than the rest of the industry. Third, when you really look at the gross margin mix again across the other segments, particularly Storage and HPC, there are two different stories there. With respect to storage, you have a mix between our own IP product and third-party product that has been unfavorable to us, meaning that there were more third-party product revenues and on IP revenue. And you can see, therefore, that this has had a detrimental impact to gross margins for storage. Finally, HPC, the story there is a story that is we've always been saying, it's a lumpy business, and it's a matter of revenue scale. We had one slippage of a deal that has affected growth by six points in the quarter. That deal has closed into Q3. And really, the fundamental question for HPC is the delivery of substantial mega deals that we have planned for the second half. And so if you take all of this into account and you look at overall gross margins for the company, the story is different by segment. But it is the result of a number of actions that we have taken in Aruba and in Compute, offset by product mix shift in storage and revenue delays in HPC. On the whole, very pleased to have our gross margins where they are at 34.2%, up sequentially and better than last year. And finally, let me add to this, the performance of HPFS. The performance of HPFS is outstanding. You can see that while there is not much revenue growth. And this is not a gross margin business, it's a business that delivers substantial amounts of profit by way of operating profit margins. And the return on equity there in HPFS is very, very strong, north of 20%, which is better than our long-term outlook of 18-plus percent that we gave you at SAM 2021. So I hope this gave you color and I up back things f or you the way you want it, Simon. But if not, we're welcome to take the conversation offline with you again. Simon Leopold : Thank you. I\u2019ll hop offline. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Simon. Appreciate it. Operator, can we have the next one please? Operator : The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask more on the demand side here and you had another quarter of strong orders, maybe if you can give us a bit more color on what you're seeing on a geographic basis, particularly, I think investors have been concerned about the momentum in enterprise in Europe and ex-Russia, if you can give any color on what you're seeing in that region? And also, I don't know if you sort of pointed out what the order impact on the order number was from the Russia exit as well? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the question. As I said in my remarks, we continue to see ongoing persistent demand from our customers. I think it's a combination of them prioritizing IT spend. And honestly, the attraction to our portfolio. We have a very comprehensive portfolio from Edge to Cloud that is resonate in the market. And Tarek just talked a little bit about the strength of the Edge, which grew now in excess of 40% for four consecutive quarters. That's simply remarkable. And yet, we just delivered 9% revenue growth. So that tells you the strength of the demand. As you think about this distributor enterprise, there's just new way to work. I think the other area, obviously, as customers continue to assess their hybrid multi-cloud journeys, which is now here to stay. They see HPE GreenLake as a very solid alternative to what I call flexibility, choice and control. And the fact that one of the major clouds is leveraging HPE GreenLake to basically deliver their managed hosted distributor cloud, is a testament of that differentiation. The other thing, obviously, anything related to data is simply very strong. I think the demand for big data, analytics, AI, machine learning will continue to grow. And that's because customers need to extract insights from the data, which I think is the most valuable thing they have. Obviously, cybersecurity, Aruba with our SD-WAN and our SASE approach also provides an alternative to that. So, I think as I look forward, I personally believe and being at the World Economic Forum for the last week and listening, I think the potential slowdown is more a consumer issue more than an enterprise issue. And the reason why I said that is because every customer we talk to, they are prioritizing digitizing their businesses, modernizing their businesses, deploying cloud as an experience in this multi-cloud approach because it's all about speed and agility, and obviously, as I said before, extract every bit of insight from the data. And that's our strategy against the trends we see with HPE GreenLake, which is a data first modernization approach. Our demand is super strong, 20%, four consecutive quarters for HPE is pretty remarkable and our order backlog, as we said early on, is high quality, which means it's order -- the order book is firm. We don't see any major cancellation that will concern us at all. And last but not least, to Tarek's point, we priced the backlog to preserve gross margins. And that's what gives us the confidence not only to grow revenue, but continue to deliver our operating margin commitments and ultimately EPS commitments. The impact of Russia is -- and Belarus because you have to combine these two, is less than 2% of the revenue on a continuous basis. If you look at 2021, in terms of EPS, Tarek explained it and unpacked it for you, which we were able to kind of offset in many ways with overperformance in Q1. So, Tarek, any comments you want to say? Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So, let me add on the last part of your question. So, the impact from Russia on orders was negligible. This was not something that has affected our orders. China and Russia together, obviously, with Belarus, impacted our revenue by $250 million, the majority of that impact relates to China. And the Russia impact specifically is related to the fact that we cannot operate any more in the country and serve existing customers with our services contracts, and therefore, this has been factored into the impact. I've described that totals for China and Russia, 1% impact on total operating profit margins and $0.06 on EPS overall. But again, the majority of these impacts were driven by the China disruptions on the supply side of the equation. And yes, I agree with Antonio on the -- totally agree on the resiliency of the demand. I simply want to add the fact that even though there could be a slowdown in the EU, the European governments are ramping up a number of initiatives that are all in our favor in the digital space, which gives us confidence for the medium to long-term. Antonio Neri : And I will say, our diversification of our coverage around the globe also is a good positive thing for us. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks for that Samik. Can we get the next one please? Operator : The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. I hear your comments about the confidence around the demand trajectory and that orders continue to be very strong. But as you look into the second half, can you talk about how those demand trends are breaking out across regions, if you're seeing any variability from 90 days ago? And you also sort of maintained your free cash flow guide, but EPS, you alluded to some of these impacts, the $0.06 that you alluded to, Tarek, but you're maintaining your free cash flow. What are some of the offsets that are allowing you to do that? And when you look at the second half free cash flow that needs to come in extremely strong, so can you talk about what levers we should expect within those free cash flow moving pieces that get you to your guide across the second half? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Let me start and I would like Tarek to talk about the free cash flow, Wamsi. Listen, so far, so far, and I can only talk so far, I have not seen any major deviation from 90 days ago on demand, continue to be very strong. And that's why we use the word persistent. Persistent meaning is there, right? And then I think it depends on what happens here in the back half of the year with some of the other policies, Tarek mentioned some of them in Europe. But obviously, as we think about inflation, interest rates and whatnot, that may or may not have an impact. But as I said earlier, Wamsi, I think it's mostly on the consumer side and the enterprise side. If anything, I will argue, it will have a positive impact to our GreenLake because customers want to maybe preserve some CapEx and then would use more of the as-a-service model. And still, deal with the reality that this is a hybrid multi-cloud journey, and therefore, for those award loads and data that cannot move outside their premises or a colocation or even moving from the edge for that matter, GreenLake is perfectly suited for that. And that's why it's a combination of our solutions, now 50-plus cloud native services, the fact that Google is going to use our solution is a very strong endorsement. But I think we are positioned to capture either way. And I think our backlog gives us a very strong foundation to build from there as we look forward. Tarek, you want to talk about the free cash flow question? Tarek Robbiati : Yes, sure. So first Wamsi, if you want a rough rule of thumb when you're looking at EPS changes and how these EPS dollars translate or sense translates into free cash flow, every cent of EPS is essentially $13 million to $15 million, right? So when you look at the lowering of our guidance is very much contained in the guidance we gave at the free cash flow level. So the lowering of our guidance back to the SAM 2021 guide is very much contained in the free cash flow guide that we gave you. And the reason why we gave you this free cash flow guide was because of the working capital assumptions that we had made at the beginning of our fiscal year. So I feel comfortable that we are within the free cash flow guide. Now the second part of your question is what makes you confident that in the second half, you can generate this quantity of free cash flow given where you are at the end of the first half. I would simply say to you that we expect, first and foremost, working capital to become a tailwind in the second half as opposed to the first, where it was a headwind because of the inventory actions that we've taken. And by the way, we've done this before. In fiscal year 2019, I want to remind everybody, we generated in the first half, $200 million of free cash flow and in the second half, we generated $2.2 billion. So, more than -- 10 times more than what we generated in the first half. This was offset by $666 million that we had to pay for an arbitration case that we lost at the time in fiscal year 2019. And we had very little time to turn around and offset the impact of that arbitration case, and yet we came into our guide that we gave at the time. And really look also at the trends on operating free cash flow that we highlighted to you as part of this call, you will observe that our seasonality is very much in line with fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. Fiscal year 2021 was a different story because in fiscal year 2021, you add the impact of restructuring costs that were affecting free cash flow. And if you will observe the detail of our press release with the tables that we provided you, you will see that our restructuring costs are coming down overall relative to fiscal year 2021. So, lots of puts and takes there, but we are happy to reaffirm the free cash flow guide of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Antonio Neri : This way -- one thing for me to say is that we are exactly what we were at the October Security Analyst Meeting, where we guided 3% to 4% revenue growth; the EPS guidance we just provided today, which is $1.96 to $2.10; and a free cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. And knowing the seasonality of our business, we say at the time this year will be a normal seasonality business as you take the two years of COVID out of the way, we are very confident to deliver that number. It's exactly what Tarek said, it's the working capital is going to turn favorable to us. And as we continue to drive the backlog down over time, that will help us as well. So, the earning correlation to free cash flow is the same we provided as one. And in terms of restructuring, just to be clear on that one, we are very pleased with the progress we've made, which obviously was there, we refer to the time reallocating resources to the areas of growth, you can see the areas of growth being HPC, AI, edge, and GreenLake, obviously, which are paying off to us and on track to deliver the $800 million net savings that we committed at the time. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Appreciate it. Can we go to the next one please, Chuck? Operator : Yes. The next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes, hi guys. thanks for the question. I guess in the ongoing spirit of trying to make sense of an incredibly complicated supply situation, I wanted to come back and kind of maybe juxtapose your performance here against a couple of other companies. So, if I look at Cisco, they, I would say, objectively performed quite a bit worse on supply than you guys did. You had some sort of a middle of the road impact, not too bad of an impact from what I can tell in the numbers. And then if I look at Dell, they had almost no impact. Although Dell did call out some looking forward issues with server supply. So, I just wonder if you could dig into that a little bit for us and kind of help us understand some of the puts and takes around supply, maybe why those differences of performance emerged? And then I have a follow-up. Antonio Neri : Sure. I'm going to start. But I think -- I don't think you can look quarter-by-quarter. Honestly, you have to look at the half and then in the second half. If you look at our performance in Q1, we did very well. And on the balance, I think we are pleased with the first half. Listen, and then there is a lot of puts and takes here because factory locations plays a role. So sometime you're in the right side of the location, sometimes you're not. And obviously, for us, the impact of Shenzhen and Shanghai was there in April, and Tarek quantified that for you, that impacted not just the compute business, every line of business because other products come from that side. Some of our vendors did not have the same impact. So that\u2019s why it's important. The other one is that you make strategic choices about components two to three years ago. And those -- there are some suppliers more impacted than other ones. And therefore, you need to go into the details of the product itself and configurations and whatnot. And last but not least, when you look at our performance, let's remind ourselves, we have a unique setup in China. And that set up basically says we cannot consolidate the China revenue that our partner today delivers. And when you look at the China growth, I can tell you, our H3C business is performing exceptionally well in China. However, the only thing we recognize on that is the dividend that we collect, but not the revenue. And then when you look at the segment, call it, the server category, it is compute plus HPC plus H3C, as the way market share gets reported. So that's why I look at this from a half performance. We made it better in Q1, maybe a little bit less so in Q2. Again, some of our competitors, namely Dell, as you said, on some aspects. But on a balance, not that far off, again, Cisco definitely we did well on every metric you want to look at it. And -- but in the end, we are focused on the full year to deliver that guidance of 3% to 4% and obviously exit the year with still quite a large backlog, which bodes well for 2023. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. I want to add also, Rod, that the -- in what you said, it's really important to look at what happens at the bottom line and at the margin level. And when you really look at how we've outperformed Dell on the margin level, Q1 and Q2, considering it simply the compute margins alone compared to the ISG margins is very telling. Antonio Neri : Yes. I think on that note, I mean, delivering 13.9% on what people refer as a commoditized business compared to 10.2%, which includes server storage and networking, I think it's pretty remarkable. But I think also shows our strategy to drive profitable revenue growth, not just revenue for the sake of revenue. Rod Hall : Great. Okay, guys. So I am going to leave it there. Thank you very much for the answers. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thanks, Rod. Next question, please? Operator : The next question will come from Irvin Liu with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you for the question. So the large delta between your orders growth and revenue trajectory suggests that there still remains a large amount of unfulfilled demand. Given this dynamic, do you envision a scenario where customers begin to perhaps rearchitect their infrastructure so that a larger mix of their IT workloads whether that's compute, storage, networking, HPC are delivered via cloud native GreenLake as-a-service models? Antonio Neri : That's a great question. We see that more and more. Obviously, I think what customers are battling is the fact they are going through a multigenerational IT journey here. That they have to modernize. The fact that data has gravity and obviously, some industry are more regulated than others. Then you talk about latency and experience that really matters. Cost, obviously, is another big component because at scale, they need to comprehend the cost aspect of it. And GreenLake is an amazing platform we have developed over the years to give them access, flexibility, and control against all the needs. In a way, they are moving away from running IT to more innovating on IT and that's why this data-first modernization approach is so relevant. And that's why we already have more than $6 billion in the balance sheet related to the HPE GreenLake business, which again grew 107% in Q2. And obviously, that -- those bookings eventually will unwind from the balance sheet and through the P&L. And the other important fact here that Tarek show in one of his slides, is the fact that our mix of GreenLake is shifting every single quarter to more software and services, which obviously comes with a significant higher margin than just the hardware. So, that's why I think about the order momentum is super strong, the marquee type of customers across events is super strong. The fact that we keep adding capabilities, the mix is shifting and that's totally accretive to our gross margin as we go forward. And this is one of the key moments of our company, transforming into a relevant platform that customers can use as they go through this journey that we just -- that you just highlighted. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Irvin, for the question. Operator, let's go to the last one, please. Operator : Our last question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle McNealy : Hi, thanks very much for the question. Can you give us a sense for the deferred revenue position in HPC and AI with the business you already have lined up and scheduled to deliver? You obviously already have one that was reach acceptance in Q3 already. And maybe give us a sense for the operating margin level that, that revenue is expected to come in at. Do you expect -- I mean, given the project costs times are taking in advance of revenue recognition, how much catch-up profitability might you get? And what does the margin profile look like a business that's expected for the back half of the year? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Sure. Listen, I'm continuing to be incredibly bullish about this business. Supercomputing is necessary to advance AI and deep learning solutions to solve some of the biggest societal challenges and honestly, climate and other. As I think about the current situation we are in, we have almost $3 billion in backlog. A couple of two quarters ago, we were talking about $2.5 billion and maybe a year, $1 billion, $1.5 billion. So, we have been continuing to grow the momentum with customers. By the way, it's all over the world. If you look at the wins, including the number three supercomputer called Lumi, that's in Europe. We have also supercomputers in France, in Germany and so forth. So, we are clearly the market leader there. However, this business is lumpy, as we said, right, from the time you book the order to time you recognize revenue, it can be several quarters. And the reason that's the case is because there are large installations and customers need to go through their own process to validate the world load. And over time, right, we're going to have a quarter, you're going to see a massive growth in revenue, which is not linear in many ways as many of those customer systems gets accepted. So, -- but in terms of margins, I will let Tarek comment on this. Obviously, have to look at long-term, not just quarter-by-quarter because that's not how this business works. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, that's right. You said very well, Antonio. I'll add to the margin part of the question saying, our Q2 operating profit margin was affected by the ramp in project-related costs, and they were recognized ahead of revenue for a couple of very large mega deals that we're expecting to close by year-end. And therefore, as a result of that, we expect operating margins to return to more in range with historical levels on this business, and we feel pretty good about these prospects. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks, Kyle, for the last question. Antonio, I'll turn it over to you for some closing remarks. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, everyone. I know there's a lot going on a lot of news today to cover, but I appreciate you making the time. Again, walk away from this quarter, feel good about the momentum we have with the persistent demand that we see in the market with an amazing set of solutions that are attracting customers. A testament of that is 20%, again, bookings with a backlog that gives us the confidence to deliver on our commitments. And honestly, I'm optimistic about the future, about the opportunity to innovate for our customers and to deliver the value to our shareholders. So again, thanks for your time today. I know there will be follow-up calls after this call, and I appreciate you making the time. Andrew Simanek : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

Also, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency. Finally, after Antonio provides his high-level remarks, Tarek will be referencing the slides and our earnings presentation throughout his prepared remarks. As mentioned, the earnings presentation can be found posted to our website and is also embedded within the webcast player for this earnings call. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Well, great. Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining today's call. As we have demonstrated throughout 2022, HPE is delivering for our customers and our shareholders. In the third quarter, HPE grew revenues, increased profits and strengthened gross margins through steady operational focus and execution and despite continued tight supply conditions and unfavorable foreign exchange. In our results, you will see the customer demand for our industry leading portfolio. We continue to accelerate our recurrent revenue this fiscal year, which validates the compelling value proposition we offer our customers, and the long and the strong response to HPE GreenLake, our unified edge-to-cloud as-a-service platform. Customers continue to prioritize investments in IT. They find HPE's technology solutions to be particularly relevant in today's complex macroeconomic environment where technology innovation is critical to accelerate business transformation and deliver important business outcomes. In the third quarter, total HPE revenue increased 4% year-over-year to $7 billion, which was also above the sequential outlook we have given. New orders exceeded our expectations, despite finally starting to decelerate the growth rates, bringing our quarterly exit backlog to another record level. That is significant, considering that for the previous four consecutive quarters, we have grown orders 20% or more year-over-year. We continue to see robust customer demand in the market and a high-quality, durable sales pipeline. Our HPE GreenLake customer base is growing, and our customers are [voting] (ph) with their workloads and data. In Q3, we doubled HPE GreenLake new level of growth year-over-year, and our existing HPE GreenLake customers continue to renew and expand contracts with us. The HPE GreenLake platform has an exabyte of data under management and customers worldwide connect more than 2 million devices to it. The momentum is reflected on annualized revenue run rate up 28% and total as-a-service orders up 39% year-over-year, bringing our year-to-date orders growth to 86%. These indicators show enduring demand for our as-a-service solutions, even while supply constraints limited some installations. Once again, we expanded gross margins in the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7% was up 0.5 points sequentially and matched the highest we have ever generated since we began our as-a-service business in 2019. We improved non-GAAP operating margin even more than gross margin to 10.5% this quarter, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48, a 9% sequential rise and 2% year-over-year. Our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion, and our free cash flow in the quarter was $587 million. This is in line with our typical seasonality as we improve cash conversion cycles in the second half. From a supply chain perspective, the dynamics remained largely unchanged from the last few quarters, with certain components still in tight supply, which limited shipments. However, we have made progress in proactive measures we have taken to enhance the resilience of our supply chain, including steering demand for products that do not require supply-constrained components, offering new multi-sourcing options and implementing proper design changes to our world-class engineering capabilities. We could also see some easing in supply condition, if consumer demand continued to slow and component capacity shift towards enterprise customers. Overall, we expect supply chain to remain challenged, supply to remain challenged into next year, although with some very early signs of potential easing in the near term. We remain focused on translating customer demand into profitable revenue growth, as shown in our Q3 results. Customers continue to tell us that they need to drive their important digital transformation work while managing costs. And it is clear we commit those needs with our edge-to-cloud portfolio delivered through the HPE GreenLake platform. HPE GreenLake brings a unified hybrid cloud experience to our customers data and workloads enabling them to consume IT as utility. In June, I was thrilled to join 80,000 customers and partners, again, in person in Las Vegas at HPE Discover. We unveiled a series of new cloud services and enhancements for the HPE Connect platform to further advance the hybrid cloud experience for customers. We were particularly excited to announce HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise, which addresses customers' desire for their own automated, flexible enterprise-grade private cloud. We recognize the important role our partner ecosystem plays in our success and the success of our customers to continue to expand our growing partner ecosystem and enable them to adapt to customers' evolving requirements, we launched a new program that helps partners build their business on top of our HPE GreenLake platform. Customers are entrusting HPE GreenLake with their most critical workloads and applications. Japan card network, Japan's leading credit card payment network and an existing HPE GreenLake customer expanded its contract in Q3 to add a 100% for [Indiscernible] platform running on HPE NonStop servers, with an integrity -- with an integrated softwares. The new implementation will power the CARDNET systems demanding, transaction-intensive applications as Japanese consumers rapidly increase use of credit cards and cashless payments. In India, the country's largest public sector steel producer also expanded adoption of the HPE GreenLake platform to increase productivity and reduce energy consumption. By modernizing its critical S&P environment with HPE GreenLake, the organization can respond more quickly to business demand and help reduced its data center footprint by over 16% to help reach sustainability goals. These are just two examples of existing customers doubling down on HPE GreenLake platform to address new needs. We see this as an important endorsement of the valuable role HPE GreenLake plays in our customers' IT strategy. At the edge, we continue to drive innovation with our solutions. Aruba had an impressive quarter with revenue rising 12% year-over-year and orders increasing more than 15% for the seventh consecutive quarter. In Q3, Aruba announced new AIOps capabilities to reduce the time IT teams spent on manual tasks like network troubleshooting, performance tuning and security enforcement. These new AI basing sites leverage Aruba's industry-leading data lake from more than 120,000 Aruba users who are now on the HP Connect platform to enhance visibility, operations and the user experience. Our Edge technology was on display early this month as we created a secure network to power the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 2022 in the UK. Aruba provided the games network connecting thousands of staffs and volunteers and over 4,400 athletes across 20 venues and 38 concurrent events to ensure smooth execution of the games. Committed to leaving a legacy of digital sustainability in the region, HP is now working with the local organization to make the technology used for the event available to the community, including schools and hospitals. As data continues to grow and evolve rapidly, we are seeing customers use our technology to allow data in incredible ways. Catharina Hospital, one of the largest hospital and leading centers for heart diseases in the Netherlands is using HPE Ezmeral software to build a cloud native data lake house that security collects and analyzes anonymized patient data from internal and external sources. This will accelerate mobile training and tech anomalies among the 500,000 electrocardiograms already available for these analysis with higher precision to identify the correct diagnosis and treatment. And in one of the most exciting breakthroughs to showcase the power of AI at scale, earlier this month, I was pleased to visit the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to celebrate Frontier, the world's first fastest and greenest exascale supercomputer that HP built for the lab. Frontier represents a new area of scientific discovery and innovation that will strengthen US national security and industrial competition. HPE has a long history of industry first and one-of-a-kind innovation that advances societal progress. We see this as a part of our purpose to advance the way people live and work. We also delivered on our purpose through our commitment to create a more equitable and sustainable world. Early this summer, we took the bold step of accelerating our net zero carbon emission target by 10 years to 2040. Effective strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions, are a cornerstone of corporate longevity, and we continue to help customers drive their own sustainable transformation. I'm proud of HPE's Q3 performance and the progress we are making to cement our position as the leading edge-to-cloud company. When I speak to customers, it is very rewarding to hear how they are using our differentiated portfolio to solve their most critical business problems. Every day, we are proving how essential HPE is to the customers and communities we serve. We couldn't do this without the dedication of our 60,000 team members who impress me every day with their bold innovation and disciplined execution. We have crafted a strategy at HPE that is winning in the marketplace, and I'm confident in our ability to execute on our commitments with strong demand, a solid pipeline and a unique edge-to-cloud offering that is delivering revenue growth and expanded gross margins and operating margins for our company. I look forward to updating you about our strategic priorities and outlook when we host our Security Analyst Meeting in late October. I hope you will join to hear how we plan to continue to generate value for HPE's shareholders. Let me now ask Tarek to discuss our performance in detail and go through our business segment results. Tarek, over to you. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. As usual, I'll be referencing the slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed the key highlights on Slide 1. So, now let me discuss our Q3 performance details, starting with Slide 2. We continue to see healthy demand across our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio. As expected, year-over-year order growth rates moderated to down 9% this quarter as we begin to lap challenging compares. As a reminder, orders were up 29% year-over-year in Q3 of fiscal year 2021. We continued to grow our backlog sequentially this quarter to a new record level that is up 96% year-over-year. Our backlog is also expected to be roughly flat next quarter and remains firm with no meaningful cancellations. This maintains our confidence in achieving both our fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook of 3% to 4% growth adjusted for currency and our longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook provided at our 2021 Securities Analyst Meeting. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $7 billion, up 4% year-over-year and above our outlook of up low-single-digits sequentially despite an ongoing challenging supply environment and greater currency headwinds. Based on current rates, we now expect currency to be a 2.5-point headwind to revenue for the full year as opposed to the 50 basis points expected at the start of our fiscal year. We continue to be very pleased with the resiliency and expansion of our non-GAAP gross margins, despite the inflationary environment and ongoing supply chain disruptions that are driving up material and logistics costs. We delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-over-year, driven primarily by strong pricing discipline and our continued mix shift towards higher-margin software-rich offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins were 10.5%, up 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, reflecting operating leverage from strong gross margin and OpEx savings from our cost optimization actions taken during the pandemic. We expect to gain further operating leverage in the short term, as we drive more revenue growth and benefit from investments in the high-growth, margin rich areas of our portfolio. With our better-than-guided revenue growth, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48, up 9% sequentially despite elevated input costs from the ongoing industry-wide supply constraints and foreign exchange impact. As previously indicated, cash flow from operations is following our normal seasonality this year, and working capital has also turned into a tailwind in the second half. In Q3, we generated $1.3 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $587 million. We continue to make further investments in strategic inventory to navigate the current supply environment, and we are now at peak inventory levels. We will begin to work our inventory balance down next quarter and into the following year, and I'll touch more on that shortly in our outlook. Finally, we continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million of dividends in the current quarter and are declaring a Q4 dividend today of $0.12 per share payable in October. We also repurchased $197 million in shares, on track towards our goal of at least $500 million of share buybacks executed this fiscal year and bringing our year-to-date total capital returns to $851 million, reflecting our confidence in future cash flow generation. Slide three highlights key metrics demonstrating our progress in our as-a-service business, with more recurring revenue at higher margins. Total as-a-service orders remained robust, up 39% year-over-year as we begin to lap more challenging compares. Our year-to-date as-a-service orders are up 86%, which is the best indicator of the long-term health of this business and supports our confidence in achieving our three-year ARR CAGR target of 35% to 45% from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2024. Our ARR growth rate improved from last quarter and was up 28% year-over-year to $858 million, but still face supply constraints continuing to limit some installations. We also continue to expand our as-a-service margins as our mix of both software and services continues to increase to 64% in Q3, up 6 points year-over-year, with our expanding cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on slide four. Our growth businesses continue to show improving top line momentum and record levels of backlog fueled by strong demand. In the Intelligent Edge, we achieved both a record level of orders and revenue in the quarter. We grew orders double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and have roughly 20 times our normal levels of backlog. Revenue growth accelerated to 12% year-over-year, outperforming the competition and demonstrating particular strength in Silver Peak, and our Edge-as-a-Service offerings, both up strong double digits. We delivered operating margins of 16.5%, up 390 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting the improving operating leverage in this business and this despite higher component and logistics costs. In HPC and AI, revenue grew 15% year-over-year and backlog of awarded contracts remained robust at just under $3 billion. Our Q3 operating profit margin was 3.4%, up 9 points sequentially and is expected to increase further next quarter, with the recognition of large deals. In compute, demand remained robust with backlog growing sequentially to another record and is now at five times normal levels. Revenue was down 1%, reflecting a continued difficult supply environment with some improvement expected next quarter with new multi-sourcing options for certain components and demand steering towards new solutions. We also continue to be very focused on executing our dynamic pricing strategy that has been effective in managing the increased supply and logistic costs and gives us a very high-quality backlog. The results are showing up in our operating margin performance at 13.3%, up 210 basis points year-over-year and still well above our long-term target set at SAM 2021 of 11% to 13%. Within Storage, we achieved another record level of backlog and revenue was up 1%. We continue to emphasize our own IP margin reach products that were up double digits, including nimble and hyper-converged. Our as a service offerings within storage like Block are also leading order and ARR growth among our business segments. With the favorable mix shift, our operating margins improved to 14.7%, up 210 basis points sequentially. With respect to Pointnext operational services, combined with storage services, orders grew again and are up year-to-date mid-single digits in constant currency, similar to levels for total fiscal year '21 despite the exit of our Russia business. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenue and profits for each of our segments. Within HPE Financial Services, volume increased 4% year-over-year in constant currency with strong performance in GreenLake and revenue rose 1%. It's worth noting that our leasing business is well insulating from rising interest rates over time, as we price based on a spread and customers often choose to extend their leases during uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Our profitability also continues to benefit from higher residual value realization and bad debt write-offs have returned to pre-COVID levels. Our operating margin was 11.8%, up 70 basis points from the prior year, and our return on equity at 19.5% remains well above the 18% plus target set at SAM 2021. Slide 5 highlights our revenue and EPS performance, where you can see our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the difficult supply environment, the exit from our Russia business and increasing headwinds from currency. Year-to-date through Q3, we have already experienced a headwind of $0.05 from currency and $0.03 from exiting Russia. In spite of these headwinds, we delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our edge to cloud strategy. This improvement can be seen on Slide 6, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q3 of 34.7%, up 50 basis points sequentially, and flat year-over-year, showing their resilience in spite of the increased component and logistics costs. This was driven by both our strategic pricing actions and the favorable mix shift we have been driving to edge on IP storage and our as a Service business. Moving to Slide 7. You can see our non-GAAP operating margins this quarter of 10.5%, up 1.2 points sequentially and up 70 basis points year-over-year. This reflects revenue growth combined with both gross margin expansion and OpEx savings to give us strong operating leverage across the business. This has also been achieved while continuing to invest more in both R&D and our go-to-market in strategic areas of the business for future growth. On Slide 8, let's spend some time reminding everyone about the status of our unique setup in China through H3C. As disclosed in late April, we have extended our existing put option that is stuck at 15 times trailing 12-month earnings through to October 31, 2022. We did this to enable the new investors at the Unigroup level to complete their restructuring and are now determining the longer-term path forward for our stake. We value our presence in China, the second largest and fastest-growing IT market, although prior to the execution of any extension, we will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. H3C makes up a significant portion of our P&L and cash flow, and you can see that we are generating growing value to shareholders with our unique setup. Our equity interest rose 21% in fiscal year 2021 and has grown another 9% in this Q3. Needless to say, we will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this valuable asset. Turning to Slide 9. Our cash flow from operations was $1.3 billion in Q3. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half. We have been strategically building inventory throughout this year to navigate the supply chain environment. While we still expect to start working down inventory levels in Q4, it will take longer than expected and into fiscal year 2023, but still puts us in a better position to convert the continued order demand into revenue and cash in future quarters. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 10. As discussed, Antonio and I are very pleased with the continued demand strength and growing backlog that gives us confidence in achieving our original SAM revenue guidance in fiscal year 2022 for growth of 3% to 4% adjusted for currency that now includes a 2.5-point headwind from foreign exchange rates on a full year basis. More specifically for Q4 2022, we expect revenue to be up at least 5% sequentially as reported, which includes the larger currency headwind. This is still above our normal seasonality to reflect some improvements in supply due to the full resumption of factories activity in China and our actions to multi-source, more components and steer the demand. From an EPS perspective, we are tightening our fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP outlook range as we move towards the end of the year to $1.96 to $2.04. This reflects the impact from the supply environment, which we expect to sustain into Q4, and further appreciation of the U.S. dollar since last quarter. As a result, this implies that for Q4 2022, we expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.52 to $0.60. Furthermore, our free cash flow is also being impacted by exiting our Russia business as well as headwinds from unfavorable currency movements that were previously absorbed in our prior outlook. As a result, we now expect to deliver fiscal year 2022 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. So overall, I am very pleased with our results in the quarter that can be characterized by sustained demand and very solid execution, navigated a continued challenging supply environment. With record levels of high-quality backlog, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the ongoing edge-to-cloud opportunity and close out a strong fiscal year 2022. We look forward to seeing you at our next Securities Analyst Meeting in October to provide our outlook for the fiscal year and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I wanted to talk a bit about the relative strength in your guidance and how you're thinking about your backlog and that, obviously, contrasting that with your competitor that reported last week, who had much more conservative or dire outlook on demand, frankly. So I'm curious, how have you stress tested the backlog? I mean what gives you confidence in coming out and effectively taking up guidance because there's more of a currency hit now. So just any color you can give us maybe even on a geographic basis or a vertical basis in terms of what you're hearing and seeing? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thank you, Shannon, for the question. I may start, and then Tarek, please feel free to add your comments. I mean, I will say, this quarter, Shannon, was characterized, in my mind, by enduring customer demand. And you see what the backlog is now. I mean, it's a record level, more than 3x normal historical seasonality in some segments. It's just amazing to see the demand momentum, think about the Aruba 20 times historical levels and even Compute five times historical levels. So that's very pleasing. And I think it's a testament of our value proposition, because GreenLake is a pull-through platform for us across every aspect of our portfolio. As we said on the supply chain, the supply chain dynamics remain largely unchanged. But what has changed for us is that over the months and the quarter, we have taken actions to dual source or to steer demand in our products and then obviously implement design changes. I think because of our combination of our portfolio and customer segments, we believe we are very well positioned to move forward through this challenge as we go into next quarter and into 2023. But we expect supply to remain challenged as we get into 2023. That said, I mean, the fact of the matter is that we believe that, ultimately, we're going to see easing signs because of the -- of what we see in the consumer space and even in automotive and industrial, which are a conversation with the suppliers as they start thinking now how to balance that supplier substrate and then obviously, enterprise is well positioned. In terms of clearing the backlog, this is going to still take quite a bit of time, and that's a good news for us, because it gave us momentum in Q4 in 2023, which is great because remember, two things have happened in that backlog. Number one is price for a strong gross margin as Tarek just went through. So in many ways, it's protected for that gross margin. And number two, we have not seen any meaningful cancellation of all. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Shannon, if I can add on a couple of comments. What we're doing is we are engineering new solutions that are less dependent on components that are experiencing shortages. We're steering demand toward those solutions, and this is across every facet of our portfolio. We are also multi-sourcing the most constrained components, and this is helping working through the backlog. But as Antonio said, this will remain a challenged environment into next year. And that is actually for us an opportunity to continue to drive revenue with high-quality margins into fiscal year 2023. I do want to pick up on your point that you made very rightly about the guidance and having absorbed 200 basis points incremental in foreign exchange terms. This is a very important point. 200 extra basis points of headwind is about $580 million of revenue. You multiply this by the OP margin, and you can really look at what impact would that have had on EPS. So we are very pleased with the performance of our business. And the fact that in spite of substantial foreign exchange headwinds, we are able to maintain the revenue guide of 3% to 4% in constant currency, and therefore, our EPS guide as a result. So thanks for pointing that out. Antonio Neri : One more thing, Shannon, is for you to also understand is that as we continue to grow the as-a-service component of this, the solutions for storage, compute, private clouds and the like are more standardized, which give us a better predictability on that front. So that will also help us move through this supply tight environment. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks for the question, Shannon. Can we get the next one please operator? Operator : The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Maybe building upon that question. The OpEx or kind of your EPS commentary would indicate maybe slightly higher OpEx into Q4, particularly given kind of the gross margin levers that you saw in the last quarter. So you noted some of that is FX adjusted, but I would think that there's kind of an FX tailwind on the OpEx piece. And so I just wanted to get a sense of -- is it -- are you seeing larger than expected expenses and OpEx? Is there less gross margin leverage as maybe we recognize some higher priced inventory? Just anything to note there into Q4 would be helpful. Thanks. Tarek Robbiati : Of course, Meta. Thanks for asking the question. So FX is, obviously, a headwind to revenue because 55% of our revenue in the company is denominated in non-US dollar currencies. But it's -- as you point out, a tailwind to OpEx to some degree. Some of the cost that we incur is therefore lower on a dollar basis. Net-net FX is a headwind to operating profit and EPS. And so we started our cost containment in the middle of the pandemic, as you may recall, in April, May 2020. And we stay disciplined on OpEx moving forward. And this is shown to you by our gross and operating margin performance. We feel comfortable about our gross margin trend, and we believe per my script, that there is further opportunity to extract operating leverage in Q4 and beyond, thanks to the growth in high margin areas of our portfolio such as the edge. I feel pretty comfortable about the situation. If you look at our gross margins, to add more color, they're up 50 basis points sequentially and flat year-on-year. And this is in spite of an inflationary environment that would put a lot of pressure on supply chain, logistics costs and material costs, obviously, but also on labor costs. So on the whole, look for our margins and where they stand relative to those headwinds that we just discussed. Antonio Neri : I will admit a couple of things. First of all, year-over-year, you see a slight decline in OpEx as a percent of revenue, but that OpEx that we report, obviously, large maturities, R&D and FXD. But when you look at that OpEx as a productivity lever against our orders and what we have done, you can see with the backlog we have, we have improved our productivity particular on the sales force side. And then in R&D, to Tarek's point, we started this program in Q2 2020 at the beginning of the pandemic. In fact, I will say we were the first company to come out with a resource allocation and optimization program that allow us to manage cost in a discipline way that reposition resources in the areas of growth we want to drive going forward. And so Tarek also said, we will continue to see operating leverage as we convert the backlog and we scale that revenue, which obviously, we have a significant backlog. But as a percent of the order momentum, the productivity has significantly improved. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks Meta for the question. Operator, can we go to the next one, please? Operator : The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I'm wondering, if you could just comment on linearity throughout the quarter in terms of orders and whether you saw any degradation. And then I was hoping you could just maybe help quantify the aggregate backlog because, as you noted, your order compares are very difficult going forward, 20% plus for the last four quarters. So if orders end up being down 10% a year for the next three or four quarters, that's $2.8 billion less in orders. My sense is, you may have $3 billion or $4 billion in incrementally higher backlog than normal. So that would still suggest reported revenue growth could grow. But I'm wondering if you can also just sort of talk to that dynamic of, the tough order comps and likely facing negative order growth and whether the backlog ultimately measures up according to the math that I outlined that should make everyone feel good about continued revenue growth. Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. So this -- it's a great question, Toni. So first and foremost, I want to point out to you that our -- we don't comment and give a specific figure on the backlog. But suffice is to say that it's close to double what it used to be last year this time of the year. That's the first point to take away, and we're working through it and its firm. There are no meaningful cancellations. So that's a tailwind to revenue generation, and we are executing better and better in our global operations team to convert that backlog into revenues. Orders are there. And they are there when you really look at segment by segment, we give you in our presentation, the detail of the order growth. So you can see the order growth in the Edge, for example, which has been on relentless, we've had seven quarters in a row of substantial order growth at the Edge in double digits. And the same holds true for other parts of our portfolio. The HPC, AI has its own dynamics with futures and a substantial order book north of $3 billion. So demand is not slowing to the point where this affects our fiscal year 2023 guide that we gave you at SAM last year, and we reiterated during the course of this year. We still see continuous demand. Even in Q3, the demand was sustained across the portfolio in Compute, in Storage, in HPC, AI at the Edge. It's probably lower than what it used to be four quarters ago for obvious reasons. These are tough compares. But the way to think about it is that the tide has come up. And maybe now the tide is a little bit catching its breath, but it's still there relative to where we were at the pandemic data point. Antonio Neri : I will say, Toni, just to add on that, we use the word steady, because, obviously, you can't use the word growth in the context of the compares here. But steady. Steady, and then within the steadiness, we have growth in some unique segments that continue. And Tarek talked about the Edge, we have a 20 times backlog in that business. And even on Compute, we still have 5 times. So -- and the other thing to remember here is that GreenLake is an accelerator of orders intake, because that creates us momentum in renewing and expanding and cross-selling across the business. So I think the original guidance we gave us at SAM last year, which was 2% to 4% over the long-term period, still absolutely true. And then when we get together at SAM here at the end of October, we're going to tell you what we're going to do specifically for 2023. But I sit here today and I feel pretty good about the momentum we have, because demand is steady, and our strategy is resonating with the pivot to as-a-service. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Perfect. Thanks, Toni. Next question, please. Operator : The next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please, go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, I wanted to get back to the kind of as-a-service and ARR businesses. You guys are sticking to the longer-term guide here, its a little acceleration from what we've seen this past quarter. Could you just kind of dig into that a little bit? What are you seeing that's going to sustain that level of high growth over multiple years of the new programs or new products that are going to maybe transition the model so that we can keep that 25 to \u2013 I'm sorry, 35% to 45% growth rate for ARR? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. Well, our as-a-service transformation through Edge-To-Cloud platform, GreenLake, is my number one priority and it's central to our strategy to bring that unified hybrid cloud experience that everybody is talking in the market. Ultimately, customers want to consume IT solutions in different ways. And this IT utility model is growing very, very rapidly. And I would argue, we were the first with our strategy. And so we have a little bit of head start here. And you see that in our order momentum, right, year-to-date. We grew the as-a-service bookings by 86%. And so clearly, that gives you the confidence that the 35% to 45% is absolutely achievable. But what it gives me more confidence, honestly, Tim, is the fact that, when I was at Discover just two months ago, and you look at the breadth of our solutions through the platform, and the experience that we provide, whether it's to deploy connectivity anywhere in your enterprise or where to deploy a private cloud that we came out with the new private cloud enterprise solutions, where you can run any type of workload, whether it's virtualized, containerized, or bare-metal, or whether to deploy data solutions to extract value from the data is growing. And that platform today has now more than an exabyte of data under management and 2 million devices under management as well. So our confidence to deliver the 35% to 45% is absolutely there. And remember that, at the last Security Analyst Meeting, we guided by the end of 2024 to have an ARR close to $2.3 billion, and we believe we are on track to do that. Tarek, do you have any comments on that? Tarek Robbiati : I think you said very well, Antonio, we simply emphasize one thing strategically is, clearly, the word is now hybrid. Our customers have spoken, the market has spoken, the world is hybrid. For us to scale an as-a-service business in a hybrid world for any player to do so, you need to build a platform. Without the platform, you cannot scale, durably scale and take advantage of the hybrid world. And when you really look at what that means, it translates into higher margins in this business over time. The margins of this business are getting richer and richer as we add more services onto the platform and more software content onto the offerings. And we've made meaningful progress increasing our software and services mix by six point's year-over-year to the current level of about 64%. And we are targeting over 75% by fiscal year 2024 as we add more and more software content with storage data services such as Zerto, we add more softer content with networking services such as Silver Peak and new workloads. So we believe that our ARR is already well above corporate average gross margins, and we are driving it to even higher levels by adding more and more software, high-value content. Tim Long : Great. Thank you very much. Andrew Simanek : Thanks for the question, Tim. Next one, please. Operator : The next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the October quarter guide and what you're implying here. I think the implication is margins are going to be up about 100 basis points, if not more sequentially. And Tarek, I know you talked about better mix potentially there. But maybe you can just help us understand how do you think revenues could look like sequentially versus historical seasonality in October? And then as you think about this 100 basis plus margin expansion, on the operating line sequentially, what are the big enablers of that? If you kind of call this out, that would be helpful. Tarek Robbiati : Yeah. Okay. So let me try and break that down for you through the P&L, Amit. We're entering Q4 with, as Antonio said, enduring demand and a record backlog. And yes, there are still uncertainties in supply chain and the macroeconomic environment with FX. In spite of this, we believe we can grow revenue in -- by at least 5% on an as-reported basis. And this reflects above normal seasonality with some supply improvement, but we will still face also a greater currency impact. And so if you take that 5% revenue growth on an as-reported basis and you assume that gross margins will be down modestly quarter-over-quarter, you have to make that assumption because Compute margins will return to more historical ranges. You combine that with the fact that OpEx should be down modestly because of the measures we're taking and the pause we're putting on hiring and expenses that are discretionary in nature, or I&E will probably remain flat to slightly down quarter-on-quarter given the higher interest expense that we are seeing due to interest rates increasing. Tax rate will remain stable. You can assume a 14% effective tax rate as guided at SAM. You take all of that math of revenue, gross margin, OpEx or I&E and tax and you get to the guide that we gave you of $0.52 to $0.60 non-GAAP EPS for Q4 2022. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you for running the whole model to what we have here. Andrew Simanek : Appreciate. Thanks for the question, Amit. Next one please. Operator : Next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yea. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to kind of the operating margin sustainability and particularly around the compute segment. If we look back over the past several quarters, you've seen anywhere from high single-digit to kind of high-teens declines on a unit basis. However, ASPs have been up 10% to 20% year-over-year. So I guess my question is, how are you thinking about the durability of that profitability given that ASP uplift that we've seen over the past several quarters. And can you kind of separate the pricing uplift that you've seen between mix versus the pass-through of increased component pricing over the past few quarters? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah. Maybe I'll start and then I'll give it to Tarek. Thank you for the question. I mean, obviously, we are managing our -- the Compute business very different than our competition. And you see that in our operating margin performance, right, 13.3%, which is over 200 basis points year-over-year up. But we always guided you and the rest of the Street on an 11% to 13%. So we expect that over time to return to those levels, somewhere in that range. But at the same time, we continue to be incredible discipline in pricing. And that backlog that we have, which is now five times historical levels has been priced with that in mind, with that pricing discipline. And so that's why it gives us the confidence that as we go through the next handful of quarters here, we continue to see solid performance. But in the end, we will see, obviously, the balance between units and AUPs, because particularly, memory pricing will start taking effect. But at the same time, we are focusing also on profitable growth units in different segments of the market. And one strategy to do so is our GreenLake platform, because we are able to reach different customers with different configs with a margin that's more accretive, particularly because all the GreenLake's deals comes with the attach of Pointnext XOS. And one area you're going to see us also shifting is the software that comes with our compute platform, will be delivered also as a SaaS offering on the GreenLake platform as we have now entered or soon to be entered GEN-11. So, there is that dynamic of unit pricing and then offer configuration with us that we're going to drive through the next generation here. But that 11% to 13% is more reasonable in our mind. And clearly, we are doing so by managing our backlog and new orders intake. Tarek, do you have any comments on that? Tarek Robbiati : Can I just add a little bit more color on the revenue AUP units dynamic here, right? So, I want to flag that our backlog consists of very healthy increases in both units and AUPs, right? The revenue in every quarter is more and more coming from the backlog. And specifically for Q3, regarding units and AUPs, units were down in high-teens because of supply chain tightness, but AUPs rose also in the high-teens because of richer configs. And the pricing actions that we've taken place. So, it remains a very dynamic business to watch for. Antonio flagged the need to monitor RAM prices, which we're doing on a daily basis. And we can be very quick at flipping our pricing strategy the other way should the market realign. But I think the longer-term trend that I would like you to focus on is the richer configs. These are the lead driver and the more structural driver of AUP increases rather than the pricing tools and measures that we can take. And we are very, very pleased overall with the way we're driving price margin units and mix in this compute business. And as Antonio pointed out, at 13.3% OP margins, this is by far the most profitable compute server business in the industry. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thank you. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks for the question, Aaron. Next one, please. Operator : Your next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. Tarek, maybe just to follow-up on that pricing commentary. When you think about the structural versus the cyclical impacts, any way you can parse that on how much of that pricing you're seeing is structural versus cyclical? And as you're talking about the supply improvements, how should we reconcile that with the backlog remaining elevated? If we look into fiscal 2023, we start to see moderation over there in unit growth and AUP soften. Can you just help us think through the impact to cash flows as well? Thank you so much. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So, it's hard to really parse out what is structural by way of configs and/or pricing related with respect to what drives our overall AUP in the compute business. And the reason for it is, our own actions. We have started to steer the demand towards new configs where we do have the supply and particularly the Gen10 plus servers are very successful in the market today. And these are, by definition, higher config relative to the Gen10. And so, I would say a large chunk of the success that we have there is driven by our own engineering and the steering of the demand to be able to fulfill the orders that we have in the backlog. And then specifically for cash flow, overall, at the company level, the dynamic that you all need to take into account is starting from the revenue growth that we flagged, which would be at least 5% on a revenue basis, reported basis, applying the margins commentary that we discussed, you're going to have a certain amount of cash earnings growth in Q4 sequentially relative to Q3. But the most important driver of free cash flow in Q4 is our cash flow conversion cycle. We already started to see in Q3 as foreshadowed the working capital becoming a tailwind. And in Q4, as we turn through our backlog, and we drive, therefore, higher revenues, we're also going to drive inventory levels down. And our overall cash conversion cycle will move from a positive 18 today to a negative figure, which is favorable to free cash flow generation in Q4. That's the key dynamic that I want you to take away as we work through the inventory, the inventory has peaked in Q3, it will take longer than expected to work through that. But overall, our focus is on managing our cash flow conversion cycle, taking it back down to a negative number, which is good for free cash flow and we're going to start doing so with our team immediately in Q4, and we'll keep it there for the upcoming quarters. Antonio Neri : So Wamsi, just a comment on the question around structural and units and the like. We have talked about this now for a number of years, I will say. And every generation that we introduced in the Compute business, call it Gen10, Gen10.5, soon Gen11, you see that, generally speaking, the rule of two-thirds, one-third stays through over time, right? Two-thirds is structural, meaning it's related to the number of options you can attach to the server platform, and that's driven by more memory and more storage and different class of storage because obviously, as you go to NVMe and then go NVMe over Fabrics and others, including SmartNIC, the content of the service becomes richer and richer and therefore, the content of Pointnext OS also becomes richer because now you have different quantities to support. So over time, when I look at the trends, it's still kind of the same two-thirds, one-third. And this business continue to be over $12 billion, no matter how you look at it. But I'm confident, as we go through here with GreenLake, the type of configuration becomes richer as well because the cloud experience that we built around it. Andrew Simanek : Great. Thanks for the question, Wamsi. Operator, I think we have time for one more, please. Operator : The last question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Rod Hall : Hi guys. Thanks for the question. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess most of my questions have been answered. I thought maybe I would ask about financial services. That number has been down the last three quarters. Just curious, whether you guys are seeing anything within that from an origination point of view or anything else that might give us some hint as to what is going on with different -- various parts of that business. We know there are businesses outside of your own that are in there. For comparison, by the way, Dell said, they saw increased originations there because of what they're seeing in the broader macro. And I just wondered kind of whether you had any more color on that. Tarek Robbiati : Yes, certainly. So yes, similarly to our competitors we're seeing originations or what we call financing volume up. It has increased 4% year-over-year. And this is driven by strong performance in GreenLake, but also whatever else we decide to finance in HPFS financial services. So the $13 billion lease portfolio is continuing to produce a substantial amount of profits and the profits come from two sources. One, it's a money-over-money business as all their financial services are, it's about spread and making sure that the spread is unaffected by rising interest rates. This continues unabated. And we also are seeing the second profitable driver of growth in HPFS, which is the fact that in this macroeconomic environment, customers tend to use their equipment for longer, which improves the realization of residual values. And so this is all ticking in the right direction. We're very pleased with this. And if you look back at the quality of the returns from HPFS, it's extremely high. Bad debt has returned to pre-COVID levels, which is remarkable. It shows the resilience of the portfolio and quality of the portfolio. And this is what stands behind a high return on equity of 19.5%, which is up 1.3 points from the prior year, and this is well above my long-term guidance for this business for an ROI of 18% plus and well above pre-pandemic levels. So very happy with the performance of HPFS. Rod Hall : That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot, Tarek. Appreciate it. Andrew Simanek : Thanks, Rod, for the question. Antonio, maybe I'll turn it over to you for any final remarks. End of Q&A: Antonio Neri : Yes. I would just make one point on the last question, which is important that you understand as well. HPFS is very strategic when you pivot to as a service because as the business grows, you're going to manage a lot of assets. And fleet management is an essential component of the strategy. And that gives us a huge advantage when you have an asset life cycle management set of capabilities and scale, because in some cases, customers will say, ' Hey, I'm okay, we're using that solution, and we will have ability to deliver faster for our customers.' So I don't want to lose that point from a strategic perspective. Now just to closing, I know some of you have to go probably to the HPQ call, but I will wrap it up saying we had another solid quarter performance as we have done throughout 2022. I think our focus on the strategy, operational execution is absolutely delivering for shareholders, and that's reflected in our results and guidance. Our pipeline is incredibly strong and our backlog is now record breaking. And that gives us the confidence to deliver against our 2022 commitments and the guide that we just provided today. But what I'm really more pleased about is HPE is becoming more-and-more relevant to our customers because of our approach. And so we have crafted a unique, differentiated strategy that address, what I call, the data first modernization challenges and the opportunity we see in the market, and that's resonated with HPE GreenLake. So very confident in our ability to deliver what we discussed today, in Q4 and into 2023. And we have a very talented management team and 60,000 employees that really driven by this purpose to pivot the company and deliver for our shareholders. So thank you for your time, and we hope to see you at the Security Analyst Meeting in late October. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon and thank you for joining our call today. HPE had an impressive fourth quarter, delivering outstanding performance across our key performance metrics. Q4 was HPE's most profitable quarter on a non-GAAP continuing operations basis since 2017, with our second highest quarterly revenue and record quarterly free cash flow. In 2018, we introduced a clear strategy to deliver sustainable long-term value for shareholders. And in 2019, we began our pivot to prioritize recurring revenue through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. We have refocused our portfolio and our customer value proposition to a high growth and higher gross margin solutions. We also improved our operating leverage across the Company. We are now seeing these strategic actions paying off. In Q4, orders remained steady, showing continued interest in our differentiated edge-to-cloud solutions across industries from enterprises, large and small. Demand over the course of the year was enduring and proved to be better than we anticipated. We closed this fiscal year with a significantly larger order book that we had at the start of the year. I am very proud of our performance in the quarter and in fiscal year 2022. Faced with ongoing macroeconomic challenges, supply constraints and adverse foreign exchange, HPE executed exceptionally well. During the fourth quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis to almost $8 billion, which was above our sequential outlook as we started to see a slight improvement to ongoing supply constraints. Our Compute and Intelligent Edge businesses had particularly strong revenue growth, each rising more than 20%. Even on these higher revenue base, we grew our non-GAAP operating margin. Non-GAAP operating margin rose to 11.5%, up 180 basis points year-over-year, one of the highest quarterly levels in HPE's history. Non-GAAP gross margin was just above 33%, a 10 basis points improvement year-over-year, reflecting ongoing pricing discipline. As customers continue to turn to our edge-to-cloud solutions, we saw increased demand for our HPE GreenLake platform. Annualized revenue run rate rose 25% year-over-year even with supply constraints as a headwind. Total as-a-service orders again increased more than 30% from a year ago, helping us close the fiscal year with the as-a-service order growth of 68%. In the final quarter of the fiscal year as-a-service orders represented approximately 12% of the total company bookings. Non-GAAP profit in the quarter was a standout. We achieved record quarterly profit, despite the continued unfavorable effects from foreign exchange. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.57, a 19% sequential rise and 10% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow in the final quarter was just shy of $2 billion, our best ever for a quarter. Free cash flow improved in the second half of the fiscal year 2022, as expected, following better supply chain conversion [Technical Difficulty] and working capital actions as we took to increase cash flow from operations. As we look at our full fiscal year '22 performance, it is clear the HPE GreenLake platform has enhanced our financial profile with more resilient, recurring revenue. Our portfolio is steadily becoming richer in software and services. We continue to shift our next to higher growth markets and more IP-rich offerings. And we continue to invest in our go-to-market capabilities that -- they are solution-led and outcome-based. Since we began our as-a-service pivot in 2019, our AIR has more than doubled to $963 million. We exited fiscal year 2022 with more than $8.3 billion in HPE GreenLake total contract value, more than twice what it was just two years ago. In fiscal year 2022, we produced $28.5 billion of revenue, 5% compared to 2021 and above the 3% to 4% outlook we provided at Securities Analysts Meeting 2021. We achieved this revenue despite not yet having booked all revenue from our Frontier exascale system, which was delayed because our customer needed to extend the acceptance timeframe. Through a combination of pricing actions, portfolio mix shift and cost discipline, we sustained our margins in fiscal year 2022, even in the face of supply constraints, and higher components and logistic costs. We increased our operating margin moving 210 basis points from about 8.5% two years ago to 10.6% for fiscal year 2022. Overall, in fiscal 2022, our operational performance resulted in a record non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $2.02, which came in above the midpoint of the guidance we gave at SAM 2022 in Houston last month, despite ongoing supply impacts, foreign exchange challenges and our exit from Russia and Belarus. We generated the second highest free cash flow in the fiscal year, a total of $1.8 billion, 3 times what it was in fiscal year 2020. We exited fiscal year 2022 with free cash flow at the midpoint of the target we guided at SAM 2022. Our fourth quarter and year-end results position us for continued, durable, profitable growth in fiscal year 2023, and we are confident in the guidance targets we gave last month at SAM. Going into next quarter, we are optimistic demand will sustain globally. It is clear that customers view their data first digital transformation critical to their success and are prioritizing hybrid cloud solutions to propel them forward, particularly in these dynamic times. As we look ahead for the next fiscal year, after many quarters of supply constraint in our market, we are beginning to see some improvements. Demand from the consumer sector is slowing, allowing some substrate capacity to shift to enterprise IT technologies. As a result, we have been able to reduce anticipated lead times for some products. We are continuing to take proactive measures to mitigate supply chain challenges and we are working through our large order book, which has experienced no material cancellations. Over the course of 2023, we expect to see greater easing but not an end to supply shortages. Despite supply constraints, the momentum we have generated with customers for our HPE GreenLake platform has been evident across our financial metrics. HPE GreenLake offers customers a unified and automated secure hybrid cloud experience, integrated across the edge data center colocations and public clouds. It is open, so customers can take advantage of the choice in architecture, but also benefit from the consistent cloud operating model HPE GreenLake provides for all workloads and applications across hybrid IT estates. With a true cloud metering capability, HPE GreenLake enables customers to flex capacity up and down, based on their business needs while benefiting from a wide range of cloud services to protect and analyze their data. Our market-leading differentiators helped us attract more new customers to our platform during the fourth quarter than any other quarter before, leading to twice as many new HPE GreenLake logos to end fiscal year 2022 than we had a year prior. Also, customers are consuming more HPE GreenLake services, increasing usage above their original contract commitments. Our partners are also seeing the relevance of HPE GreenLake with our customers. Partners booked more HPE GreenLake orders during the fourth quarter than they ever did before, extending their streak of orders growth to 22 consecutive quarters. During the fourth quarter, we also saw a greater share of partners booking multiple HPE GreenLake deals. Next week, we will meet face-to-face with several-thousand customers and partners at HPE Discover Frankfurt to discuss hybrid cloud transformation strategies, ways to drive value from the data across the edge-to-cloud, and how to bring the cloud experience to applications and data with HPE GreenLake. At the event, we will unveil important updates to our HPE GreenLake platform. One European customer who has recently adopted the HPE GreenLake platform is SPAR. SPAR is the supermarket you see everywhere in Europe from micro roadside convenience stores to massive one-stop hypermarkets. SPAR has decided to build its own hybrid cloud on HPE GreenLake to run the Company's core business. Our platform is running all major applications of SPAR's innovation engine as the retailer pursues its ambition to create the future of grocery and retail shopping. The HPE GreenLake platform also helps SPAR use data to make strategic decisions on everything from warehousing and logistics to in-store experiences to advance its business. HPE GreenLake is playing an increasingly important role in customers' IT strategies and in addressing all their needs with one unified edge-to-cloud experience. This fiscal year, we performed remarkably well for our customers, our shareholders and our HPE team members. We helped our customers use technology to accelerate the business outcomes while navigating in dynamic environment. Our expanding market leadership demonstrates the trust that customers place in us and the value defined in the differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio that only we can deliver. Demand for our HPE solution has been enduring throughout 2022 and continue to be steady as we move into fiscal year 2023. For our shareholders, by executing our strategy, we have pivoted HPE to a richer mix of software and services that is delivering recurring profitable growth. In fiscal year 2022, we posted strong revenue growth, record-breaking non-GAAP earnings per share and outstanding free cash flow. I am so proud of our team members around the world who have made these results and our transformation possible through their ingenuity and engagement. In fact, this year, HPE achieved one of the highest employee engagement scores in the history of our company, up 20 points over the last five years. Our culture has attracted some of the brightest, most innovative talent in tech. HPE's team members are bringing their energy and ideas to write HPE's next chapter and cement us as the edge-to-cloud market leader. With our team engaged, our strategy taking flight and our market-leading solutions playing critical roles in customers' business, we enter fiscal year 2023 with incredible momentum on all fronts. And I look forward to advancing our strategy and leadership even further in the next year. And with that, I would like now to pass it over to Tarek to make his comments and provide a little bit more details about our financial performance. So, Tarek, over to you. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. Q4 was, no question, an outstanding quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q4 '22 and fiscal year '22 on slides 4 and 5. Let me discuss our Q4 performance details, starting with slide 6. Sustained demand continues to be a core attribute of our differentiated edge-to-cloud portfolio, which is translated to record or near-record results. As expected, year-over-year order growth continued to moderate in Q4 '22 to down 16% year-over-year as we lap challenging compares. Having said that, our sequential order growth was flat relative to Q3 '22, which illustrates that demand for our products and services is steady. The key takeaway here is that we are entering fiscal year '23 with an order book that is even higher than the order book we entered fiscal year '22 with, which attests to our momentum for fiscal year 2023. Now that we have closed fiscal year '22, we will again turn our attention to focus on revenues rather than orders as we have been flagging. This is because of timing differences, orders and backlog are not traditionally good indicators of quarterly revenue in normal times. We will continue to disclose orders for our as-a-service and HPE Pointnext OS business. While the supply environment is improving, it is not quite back to pre-pandemic levels. Our large order book contributes to our confidence in our fiscal year '23 revenue outlook of 2% to 4% growth adjusted for currency, and the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year '22 to '25 period we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in Houston last October. We delivered Q4 revenue of $7.9 billion, which is up 12% annually and 15% sequentially adjusted for currency. This is the second highest revenue figure since our separation transactions in 2017. It would easily have been the highest had revenue recognition from the Frontier deal not slipped into fiscal year '23. The Q4 sequential revenue growth is well above our prior outlook for at least 5% sequential growth. We have had healthy demand throughout the past two years. We now also have improving supply as supply capacity in the consumer electronics markets is redirected towards enterprise markets where demand for digital transformation continues unabated. We closed fiscal year '22 with full year revenue growth of 3% as reported. Currency and our exit from Russia and Belarus represented a 300 basis points headwind to revenue for the full year, which means we ended the year solidly above our initial guidance for 3% to 4% revenue growth adjusted for currency. Our non-GAAP gross margins remain resilient, thanks to the pricing actions we have taken. Our 33.1% non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 is up 10 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a very strong Compute quarter and higher logistics costs in the Edge business. We retain our pricing discipline and continue to shift our mix of business towards higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service offerings. Non-GAAP operating margins reached a record 11.5%, which represented a 100 basis points increase sequentially and a 180 basis points increase year-over-year. This result would not have been possible without the strategic actions we have taken back in fiscal year '20 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. These actions have put us in the position to benefit from an enhanced operating leverage for several quarters over the past three years, and this will continue in fiscal year '23 and beyond as Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity. Our cost optimization and resource allocation program announced during the pandemic of 2020 and which is now substantially finished, has achieved annual savings of $875 million, well above our initial target of $800 million. As a result, we are now rightsized and we are entering a very different phase of the Company, one where the combination of our enhanced cost structure and substantial order book is expected to deliver profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold. Thanks to revenue growth above our guidance, we delivered Q4 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.57, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. This is the highest quarterly non-GAAP net diluted EPS figure since our 2017 separations. Our full year non-GAAP net diluted EPS of $2.02 was at the upper end of our guidance range of $1.96 to $2.04 post Russia and FX and near the midpoint of our SAM 2021 guidance. Again, we estimate FX impacts and our Russia exit combined for a $0.17 EPS headwind in fiscal year '22. Our GAAP P&L reflects a noncash write-down of goodwill in our HPC, AI and software businesses. Macro trends, including contracting market multiples and higher discount rates used in our impairment test for HPC, AI and software, respectively, significantly impacted this outcome. We continue, nonetheless, to be bullish on the HPC, AI segment given our clear number one position in the market, and our outlook for this segment is consistent with what we said at SAM 2022, and software remains a critical component of our HPE GreenLake strategy. I am particularly pleased with our free cash flow performance in Q4 '22, where we generated $3 billion in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $2 billion as we work through our substantial orders and reduce our inventory. As Antonio mentioned, this brought our full year free cash flow to $1.8 billion. This is triple our free cash flow in 2020. For the year, free cash flow met the midpoint of our guidance. In fact, our full year free cash flow met our initial pre-Russia and FX guidance from SAM 2021. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We returned over $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders this year, which represents over 60% of our free cash flow. We paid $154 million in dividends this quarter and repurchased $128 million in stock. That brought our buyback plan to $512 million for the year, above our $500 million target. Our as-a-Service business momentum remains strong and this business is lifting our mix of higher margin recurring revenue. Total as-a-service orders remain robust. Orders grew 33% in Q4 despite lapping 104% growth in Q4 '21. On a constant currency basis, orders grew 43% in Q4 and our full year as-a-service orders grew 68%. This indicates the long-term health of our as-a-service portfolio and further strengthens our confidence in our three-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year '22 to fiscal year '25. Our ARR of $936 million represented 17% growth as reported and 25% growth in constant currency. For much of fiscal year '22, the industry supply constraints have limited shipments and weighed on our growth rate. We expect the improved supply environment to accelerate our ARR growth moving forward. We also continue to expand our as-a-service\u2019s margin as our mix of software and services increased to 66% in Q4, up 4 points year-over-year, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in Edge and Storage. As a result, the gross margins in our as-a-service business remain meaningfully above our corporate gross margins. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. All revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a record quarterly revenue number. We grew our revenues 23% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share across wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our Edge services platform and automation software suite. Our operating margin of 13.3% was up 2.4% annually, though down 3.2% sequentially with FX being the biggest contributor to the sequential decline. We continue to expect our Edge business to grow and perform like a Rule of 40 business moving forward. In HPC & AI, revenue fell 11% year-over-year, solely as a result of the Frontier deal slipping into fiscal year '23, which also impacted our operating margin in this segment. We are on track to close that deal in Q1 and have factored that into our guidance. We continue to have orders for HPC & AI solutions of about $3 billion to be delivered in upcoming quarters. Compute revenues grew 22% year-over-year to a near record of $3.7 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steering initiatives we have discussed in prior calls, as well as steadily improving supply availability. We have clearly outperformed the competition in fiscal year '22 and our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate a volatile supply climate while maintaining a healthy margin profile. Our Compute operating margin of 14.7% remains well above our long-term outlook for 11% to 13%, which attest of the best-in-class performance delivered by our Compute business. In Storage, we are very pleased to report 6% revenue growth led by all-flash array and HCI. Alletra is one of our fastest ramping new products ever and grew revenue 100% sequentially. In total, revenue from our own IP, margin-rich products rose strong double digits in Q4 and contributed to an annual operating margin of 15.9%, which represents a year-over-year gain of 210 basis points and a sequential gain of 120 basis points. Our storage transformation is now in full swing, as you can see. And we expect our storage business to deliver revenue growth in line with market with our own IP products growing above market. With respect to Pointnext operational services, combined with storage services, orders grew sequentially and for the year rose mid-single digits in constant currency despite the exit of our Russia and Belarus business. Finally, HPE Financial Services expanded its financial volume 3% year-over-year, and revenue rose 6%. Our operating margins fell 3 percentage points year-over-year as we adjust our prices for a higher interest rate climate. It is worth reiterating that our leasing profit dollars are well insulated from a higher rate environment over time as we price on a spread and that our business is resilient in a downturn. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is currently nearing pre-pandemic levels of approximately 0.5%. As a result, our fiscal year '22 HPEFS return on equity remained well above the 18% target we reiterated at SAM 2022. Slide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP net diluted EPS performance. Antonio and I are very pleased that our strategic focus on both the top and bottom lines is evident in these results. Our revenue and EPS continue to grow despite the volatile supply environment, the exit from our Russia and Belarus businesses and increasing headwinds from currency. As mentioned earlier, during fiscal year '22, we experienced a headwind of $0.12 from currency and $0.05 from exiting Russia and Belarus. In spite of these headwinds, we met our SAM '21 non-GAAP guidance for fiscal year '22 and delivered a better mix of higher-margin earnings across our portfolio as we continue to execute our Edge-to-Cloud strategy. This improvement can be seen on slide 10, where we delivered non-GAAP gross margins in Q4 of 33.1%. This is a 10 basis points year-over-year improvement despite a significant revenue mix shift to Compute this quarter. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the supply challenges and the favorable mix shift we are driving towards higher-margin products across our portfolio. Moving to slide 11, you can observe that we have delivered an 11.5% non-GAAP operating margin for the Company. This is not only up 180 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially, but it is the highest operating margin in the history of the Company since our 2017 separations. Our very strong Q4 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are certainly leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. And again, as I mentioned at SAM, this performance would not have been possible without the foundation provided by our resource allocation and cost optimization plan that we launched at the start of the 2020 pandemic. On slide 12, let's discuss our setup in China through H3C. As disclosed at SAM, we have extended our existing put option that is struck at 15 time trailing 12-month earnings through to December 31, 2022. We did this to allow our partners time to finalize their engagement with their stakeholders and make our final decision regarding our stake in H3C. Through our commercial contracts and equity interest, H3C has contributed a substantial amount to our EPS and free cash flow and our shareholder value in fiscal year '22. We will balance the strategic and financial benefits of a continuous involvement in China with rising risks, including geopolitical risk. We will keep you up to date as we arrive at a longer-term solution for this asset. Our cash flow story on slide 13, a test of our outstanding execution. Our Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $3 billion and $2 billion, respectively. This is aligned to our normal pre-pandemic seasonality and our expectations of working capital tailwinds in the second half. We have been strategically building inventory ahead of the competition throughout fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 to navigate the supply chain environment. Our inventory balances have now peaked and are beginning to decline as we enter fiscal year '23 and deliver on our substantial order book. Our strong Q4 cash flow brought full year '22 cash flow from operations to $4.6 billion and our free cash flow to $1.8 billion. The $1.8 billion is triple what we delivered in fiscal year '20. It is also at the midpoint of our guidance range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, despite the negative impact of Russia and FX that we estimate to be approximately $250 million. Now turning to our outlook on slide 14. As we discussed, demand for our products and services portfolio remained steady in Q4 relative to Q3. Our view remains one of enduring market demand given the mega trends of digital transformation and the explosion of data. We also believe our own portfolio differentiation will allow market share gains. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure and FX risk. I would like to remind all of you that approximately 55% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. For Q1 '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a mid-single-digit seasonal decline that we typically experience in Q1 relative to Q4 of each year. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.32 to $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.50 to $0.58. While we are pleased with our Q1 outlook, we are cognizant given the macroeconomic environment and FX headwinds that it is too early at this stage to rethink our fiscal year '23 guidance. Given the points above, we consider it prudent to assume our year may be more weighted to the first half than is typical. We are, therefore, reiterating our full year '23 guidance. This includes revenue growth of 2% to 4% adjusted for currency, non-GAAP operating profit growth of 4% to 5%, GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.38 to $1.46, non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.96 to $2.04, and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. In terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividends and expect to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year '23, just like we did in fiscal year '22. So to conclude, our results speak for themselves and a test of our outstanding execution in a quarter that can be characterized by enduring demand for our differentiated portfolio of products and services. We look forward to continuing our execution momentum in fiscal year '23. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. And congrats on good results. I was wondering if you can comment a little bit about what the demand trends look like by region? It seems like a lot of companies are citing more of a slowdown, like NetApp just now and Dell last week. I'm curious to get your thoughts on how IT budgets are shaping up for calendar '23? Most companies we're speaking with are more cautious about the near term, maybe the first half of '23 and optimistic more of a recovery in '23. And I think, Tarek, you just said that for you, you're expecting, if I heard that right, like more confidence in sort of the first half. So, any color there would be helpful. Thank you so much. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. As we said in our commentary, we exited 2022 with a significant larger book than we entered 2022. And that demand was enduring, honestly, was better than we anticipated and remains steady, because when you look at the quarter-over-quarter, Tarek mentioned, was flat. But I think we have a point of differentiation compared to others. I think it's important to recognize. First, we have a diversity of portfolio from edge-to-cloud. And you can see some of the results in the Edge, which obviously are outstanding. I think our HPE GreenLake is unique because it delivers a true hybrid experience that you can consume as-a-service, and that's also dragging the entire portfolio. And when I talk about customers, what we see, customers continue to prioritize digital transformations. And a lot of that is driven by the need to automate, simplify, be more efficient in everything they do and also prioritize that data. The data insights to me, are an important aspect of what customers are looking for. And so, I think demand is there. I think in our case, probably it\u2019s better balanced. You asked a question about the geos. I think the performance of the geo has been even, I mean, even across all the 10 geos that we have, and across the segments. I got this question early on, if this is just an enterprise or a small business? No, it is the 10 geos and all the segments from large to small, medium business. In terms of budget, just a month or so ago, we hosted what we call the Board of Advisory, and we have 25 customers that represent multiple industries. And the sentiment there is that they need to continue to digitize and they need to continue to ensure technology plays a vital role. And again, these are technologies in the edge, connectivity being one important aspect. The other one is obviously cloud, but cloud as an experience, not just putting data in one place is a true hybrid approach. And then these data, data-driven insights. And so we are, I think, very uniquely positioned to capture that opportunity. Operator : The next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle McNealy : This one is for the Compute business. We assume a big part of it was driven by the supply improvement that you talked about, but units were only up 4% year-over-year. So, there may not have been an incredible amount of backlog consumption. So, can we talk a bit more about the AUPs? They're still growing at about teens year-over-year. It was high-teens this quarter based on the pace of your price increases and the momentum of richer configs that you called out. How long do you think that this growth will continue? And what does the durability of the AUP trajectory look like for you guys? Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Kyle, thanks. I think you understand the trends in our Compute business really well. So, let me reiterate. We ended the year with record quarterly revenues of $3.7 billion. This is a 22% year-over-year growth at constant currency. Unit growth was 4% and AUP was an increase in the high-teens as you foreshadowed. And what's driving the demand for our Compute solutions is richer configs. Customers of all sizes are selecting our Compute solutions to run their private clouds and to power multitude of workloads, data types and applications. And Compute remains and will continue to remain a critical component of our customer transition towards modern edge-to-cloud architectures. And you're right in saying that with these results and the unit increase, our order book in Compute remains strong as we enter fiscal year '23. So, moving forward, trend-wise, what you can expect is, obviously, this level of AUP growth to come down as we'll have to pass on to our customers the benefit of ease -- pricing of commodity easing, but we feel very good about the prospects of Compute in fiscal year '23, given the order book, the fact that our products are more and more differentiated and the need for customers to continue to opt for greater configs. Antonio Neri : And I will say, Kyle, we just introduced the Gen11 platform. And one of the key differentiation we have -- actually, we have several -- number one is our hybrid design. It was designed with hybrid in mind, meaning the solution gets deployed and managed from HPE GreenLake, whatever you deploy that. Number 2 is continued enhancement on the security side, which is a point of differentiation. And one that really is coming up is sustainability. In our new offer, we actually provide customers with ability to optimize the Compute platform based on carbon footprint and consumption, and we get them also a carbon footprint report. So that allowed them to maximize the usage of the platform while they reduce that carbon footprint. So overall, we continue to see good momentum, and we are bringing new innovation into the platform itself. Operator : The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : I wanted to dig a little bit more into your as-a-service business. Just looking at the like absolute dollars. You had a stair step up to $936 million annualized run rate during the quarter. And it looks like there was a significant uptick in the percent -- well, at least 200 basis uptick in the percent of revenue coming from software services. So, I'm wondering what's behind that and what trends you're seeing as you sign more and more of these contracts with your customers on a ratable basis? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thank you, Shannon. I think a couple of things. So first of all, we ended the year with a 68% year-over-year growth in our bookings. Today, we have now $8.3 billion in total contract value. As you know, those are contracts -- can vary between 3 to 5 years. So, as you can imagine, that gives us a tremendous confidence that we will grow that ARR in the 35% to 45%. We actually closed 2022 with twice as many new HPE logos that we entered now into the 2022 year. And then the important fact is why the mix is shifting is because the Aruba business is all a subscription business. And Tarek made a comment about the automation suite, obviously, software-defined wide area network, and also the subscription to wireless or switching comes through the platform, but also the growth that we've seen in storage. Storage had a great quarter, particularly on our own IP product. That's all software defined, and that's all subscription-based. And what excites Tarek and me is the fact that in 2023, you're going to see an acceleration of that portfolio to HPE Alletra, which -- HPE Alletra had 100% growth sequential. And obviously, that comes also with an incredible attach of Pointnext OS. And also, as we drive that data protection strategy, the incremental value comes from backup and recovery and disaster recovery and ransomware offers. We have now those offers integrated into HPE GreenLake. And so that combination is what's driving the mix shift to more software and services rich offers. Operator : The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : I wanted to see if we could dig into what you're seeing in terms of trends for the Compute business. In particular, what's catching my attention is after this very, very strong result for the quarter, it sounds like you're confident in the outlook. And that stands in contrast to your biggest competitor in servers, which seems to be expecting a decline in calendar '23. So, if you could maybe do a little bit of compare and contrast as to why you might be seeing the world differently than they are if I'm interpreting your outlook correctly? Tarek Robbiati : Okay. Sure, Simon. So I would say, if you refer to our prime competitor, I think some of their comments are referring to the consumer side of their operation as much as referred to their enterprise side. Simon Leopold : Yes. I'm specifically looking at servers and Compute. So... Tarek Robbiati : Yes. I think overall, so when you look at their results, they were, I would say, not too bad, we did much better than they did. And that is a function of many steps that we have taken in Compute. So there is Gen11 being one of our key solutions now are gaining traction in the market as customers need bigger and richer configs moving forward. Our customers knew that Gen11 was coming and they held their orders firm. So, we had no orders cancellations that are meaningful throughout fiscal year '22. And we finally got the supply that was there to be able to bring our customers to the next-generation compute environment. So, we feel very good about where we are. And to the extent that supply is there, we have a contrasting view relative to our -- what our competitors are signaling with respect to their service business. Antonio Neri : So I will add, Simon, that the demand has been enduring and steady throughout the years -- throughout the four quarters in 2022. We exit the year with a significant larger order book. When I think about our differentiation, I think our Compute is differentiated because of HPE GreenLake. It's because of the experience we provide to our Compute platform. And the fact also, if you recall, two years ago, we said we are diversifying our go-to-market as well to attack profitable growth in segments where we did not participated as much, particularly more in the commercial to mid-market space. And one of the areas we saw great growth was through our channel ecosystem. And then, you couple all of that with our pricing discipline and then you get the results of unit growth and revenue growth with amazing profitability. So, I think we have that tailwind. What Tarek covered is all about the revenue side. But on the demand side, it comes to those factors. And I think Gen11 is another step in that direction, which actually gives us tremendous differentiation. Operator : The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Congrats on the strong results here. I guess I just wanted to see if you could talk about backlog or the order book in context of the segments of it and how to think about the supply improvement, particularly if you can shed some color on where backlog or order book remains most elevated related to sort of normal exiting the year and as supply improves next year as you outlined, where can we see the most likelihood of sort of digesting that backlog down to a bit more closer to normal levels? And it seems like you're expecting supply to remain sort of a constraint. So, backlog probably doesn't come back to normal by the end of next year, but any thoughts on that also would be appreciated. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, as Tarek said in his comments, going forward, we're going to move away from all of these backlog orders and the like to focus on the revenue. That's why we gave the revenue guidance in Q1 because I think it's a better indicator of what we're going to see. I will say, in Q4, what we were able to incrementally convert from the backlog was mid-single-digits, or order book, as we call it now, is very, very large. And in fact, in such segments, particularly in the Edge business, the order book is now bigger at the end of Q4 than it was at the end of Q3. So, the bottom line is that we see that enduring steady demand and we'll take up the entire 2023. And honestly, I'm not sure we will ever exit 2023 to back to historical level. I don't think that will be the case. Because as good as we are trying to convert some incremental aspects of the order book as we go forward to some easing of the supply, the demand continues to be there. So, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. And I think that the order book will return to normal, I would say, historical level, once the incremental capacity comes on line. Because when we saw in this particular quarter some easing, it was because some reallocation of substrate came at the expense of the consumer business, which obviously is down but the incremental capacity is not yet on line, particularly in those older technology nodes, call it, 28, 40 and 65 nanometers, which is where the constraint is. Operator : The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Your guidance for Q1 implies double-digit revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. For the full year, you're at 2% to 4%. So, is what you're seeing in Q1 really a reflection of confidence in backlog drawdown, or are you implicitly seeing demand slow over the course of the year? And then related to that, your free cash flow guidance is well below your net income for fiscal '23, despite the fact that you believe you can dry down the inventory further. Maybe you can help us with the bridge there. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Toni. Let me start, and I will give it to Tarek. As we said, we gave the revenue guidance $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion. I'm not sure it's double digit, but maybe high single digit compared to Q1 2022. But in any case, that guidance includes the recognition of the remaining part of Frontier, which obviously is an important aspect of the HPC. And then the ongoing ability to convert the order book as it comes in, plus the larger order book we already have. And then maintaining a certain level of margin, obviously, which we are confident based on our pricing and operating leverage actions we have taken. So, that's where we stand, and that's where we gave the guidance. As we go through the quarter -- through the year, sorry, we felt prudent at this point in time to maintain it because of the FX uncertainty. Obviously, FX stabilizes or slightly improve, that full year guidance implies there is some potential upside. But also, it's going to come down to the supply availability, as I just made the comments early on. In terms of the free cash flow and the working capital, I will pass it to Tarek. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Well, thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Toni. So, our free cash flow for fiscal year '23 is going to be driven, obviously, by our earnings, but also reduction in restructuring expense, and you will observe already between '21 and '22 when you have a chance to look at our 8-K filing that restructuring expense is dropping quite considerably. And that trend will continue in FY23 relative to FY22. And the third variable to our free cash flow calculation is working capital, right? So far, inventory levels have reduced between Q4 and Q3 in the amount of approximately $400 million. We believe that inventory levels have peaked and we're going to work through our order book to continue to deliver on these orders and therefore, this will reduce our inventory levels. At the same time, if the demand remains as steady as we're seeing it, we'll probably need to continue purchases moving forward. So, I feel comfortable at this stage with the guidance we gave you on free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion, $2 billion at the midpoint. Let's see how the year plays out, and we will think about giving you more color on how much free cash flow we can generate within that guidance or possibly more. Operator : The next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me? Antonio Neri : Aaron Rakers : Sorry, guys. I appreciate taking the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. I want to go back to kind of the Compute side of the business. As we look at the backlog dynamics and the commentary that you've already given. I'm curious of how you guys see component price deflation factoring into your expectations as we move forward. Put another way, is there -- how do you -- how does the Company operate as far as passing through if it's memory cost deflation and so on and so forth. How do we think about the progression of that as you think about the Compute business going through fiscal '23? Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So, thanks for asking the question, Aaron. You know that we have posted in Q4 an operating profit margin in Compute at 14.7%, which is the highest it's ever been, and it's higher than the outlook we guided you all at SAM, long-term OP margin in Compute of 11% to 13%. And the reason why we have that difference is that we believe as supply continues to ease, there will be the need for us to adjust our pricing down to continue to grow the business moving forward. So, the level of -- at which the AUPs are at today will come down as we pass on the reduction in costs from commodities, DRAMs in particular. We're starting to see some of this, but it's early days. And what's a very, very important Compute on the way up, just like on the way down, is to be extremely reactive and dynamic with our pricing. And we have now the ability to do so globally to push changes in our list prices through our ERP system over a weekend, it needs to be to react to changes in commodity prices and what we're seeing in the competitive environment. So, we remain with our business unit of Compute and the management team there extremely focused on competitive pricing dynamics because for us, it's really critical as we foreshadowed to you that we maintain scale in Compute and continue to capture the lion share of the value in the industry, which we are doing today. Antonio Neri : And in 2022, we have shown that we are the best -- are executing that strategy. No question. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks, Aaron. And Chuck, why don\u2019t we make this the last question? Operator : Yes, sir. Our final question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : I guess, my question is really around the Intelligent Edge business and maybe two parts. One, if you could just talk about the 23% growth here is fairly impressive. Any details you can give on kind of what is driving that from a product basis or even backlog versus end demand would be really helpful to understand. And then, Tarek, if I remember, at SAM, you talked about mid-20% operating margins in Intelligent Edge over time. As you look at the path from 13.3% to mid-20%. What do you need to get there? Is there a revenue number or something else just helpful to understand the margin expansion bridge from here? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Let me start, and then Tarek can talk about the margins. I want to be clear, the Edge, 100% demand-driven. Has nothing to do with backlog or any of that. The order book continued to grow in this business. And we are winning. We are taking share. And the reason why we are taking share is because we have a true differentiated value proposition that\u2019s built on three particular layers of the architecture. One is the unification of the connectivity layer with wireless LAN switching and one SD-WAN capabilities. These are both organic and inorganic investments we make over time. Remember, we did the Silver Peak acquisition. We have unique differentiation through our security layer with SASE through both organic and partnerships. And then we have a best-in-class AIOps. That's delivering tremendous value for customers to drive new experiences, to automate everything they do across the enterprise and is 100% driven by the demand at this point in time. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So, let me elaborate on what Antonio said with regard to your portion of the question that pertains to operating margins. Our operating margin for the Edge was 13.3% in the quarter. It was up annually by 2.4%, right? It was down sequentially 3.2%, but it was up annually 2.4%. I think here, you have a mix effect that is at play between as-a-service offerings and NaaS offerings that play a role in the way the margin fares in the short term. It obviously -- if we're entering the NaaS market, that is because we expect to see the margins -- the gross margins of NaaS to improve over time. So that is one factor. The other factor that has affected the margins very short term, very tactically in Q4 is logistics costs. And I flagged that in my script, logistics cost in Aruba were higher than we would have liked. But that, again, is changing. And so, we expect Aruba to perform as a Rule of 40 company moving forward. And that's the ambition that we have in the medium to long term, which is to maintain high-double-digit growth in Aruba and operating profit margins in the mid-20s range. We're comfortable with that outlook that we announced at SAM. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you for all the questions and thank you for making the time today. I want to close with a couple of more additional thoughts. Obviously, we had an outstanding quarter, an exceptionally well-executed quarter for us with record-breaking results across key performance metrics. But when you reflect back, and this is my 20th quarter as the CEO reporting earnings, this is a combination of many things we have done over the last few years. It's not just a onetime thing. When I think about that, first and foremost, we have a clear strategy. We have been executing and accelerating and is winning in the market and is winning with customers. When you have twice a month of logos that we had at the beginning of the year, that tells you customers are entrusting their transformation to HPE. Second is, we are executing better. No question about it, and Q4 was a great example of that. Third is that the demand for our solutions remains steady. And I understand the question about, well, your competitors may have or other vendors have different views. I cannot comment on their views. I'm just telling you, after 20 quarters is what I see, and what we say we do. So in the end, we probably have to take at the face value of what we tell you, and we deliver against that. And then last but not least, in 2020, Tarek and I on Q2 2020, when the pandemic started, we came here, to the call, and we told you we're going to enact a program to reallocate resources to high-growth, high-margin areas and rightsize the Company. We believe we are rightsized going forward. And those actions are paying off, not only because we delivered $175 million net savings to shareholders but because we have now different talent in different locations that give us the confidence that we can execute the strategy. So, it's a combination of four different things we have done over and over and over. In Q4, obviously, with a little bit of easing on supply, we're able to translate all the hard work into record-breaking results, and most importantly, give us the confidence that we entered 2023 with an amazing momentum, and that's why we give the guidance that we give you. And we're going to see every quarter where we stand, but we feel pretty good about our ability to deliver and potentially even exceed those numbers we give for the full year. So, with that, thank you very much. If I don't speak to you before the end of the year, I wish you a happy holidays, to you and your families. So, thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you, and have a great night.",

Finally, after Antonio provides high-level remarks, Tarek will be referencing the slides and our earnings presentation throughout his prepared remarks. And with that, let me turn it to you, Antonio. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call. We began our fiscal year 2023 from a position of great strength after delivering an outstanding 2022 fourth quarter. I am extremely pleased with how we leverage that strength to achieve impressive results in Q1. HPE posted a record set in first quarter performance, extending our track record of consistency fulfilling our financial commitments. We generated our highest first quarter revenue since 2016 and our best ever non-GAAP operating profit margin. Our focus on growth opportunities and pricing discipline produced our highest ever non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Powered by our market-leading hybrid cloud platform, HPE GreenLake, we unlocked an impressive $1 billion in annualized revenue run rate or ARR for the first time. Our results show the relevance of our strategy that addresses megatrends around edge, cloud and AI reshaping our industry, the transformation of our industry leading portfolio and the outstanding execution of our team. In the first quarter, total HPE revenue climbed 18% to $7.8 billion, significantly above the high end of our outlook. We once again expanded non-GAAP operating margin this time to a record 11.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 19% year-over-year to $0.63. Free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion, reflecting working capital needs in a quarter where we typically see use of cash. Our Q1 performance and the size of our order book position us well for fiscal year 2023. Our quarterly results, combined with confidence in our strategy and execution have led us to raise our revenue and EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. Tarek will provide more details in his remarks. From a macro perspective, the supply chain challenges we faced during several quarters continue to ease, and we expect more of that throughout fiscal year 2023. As we mentioned at the close of fiscal year 2022, we do not anticipate all supply shortages coming to an end, but we do expect supply availability to continue to improve. Our order book at the start of Q1 was larger than it was a year ago. And as we exit the quarter, it is more than twice the size of normalized historical levels. Our Intelligent Edge, HPC and AI and other as-a-service order books continue to stand at extremely elevated level. Against today's macroeconomic backdrop, demand for our solutions continue, though it is uneven across our portfolio, we also see more innovated cell cycles, specifically in compute that we have seen in recent quarters. We responded decisively to demand in the market, working to win deals across all geographies and all parts of our portfolio. The traction of our portfolio is the result of our winning strategy, aligned to major market trends around the edge, cloud and AI. We continue to anticipate what comes next for our customers and invest in innovation to address the data first modernization needs with an unmatched set of edge to cloud solutions. In addition to driving impressive organic innovation across our portfolio, we continue to be opportunistic in considering strategic acquisitions and partnerships that enhance what we can offer to our customers. Today, we announced our agreement to acquire cloud security provider access security, which will help fortify network security and strengthen our Secure Access Service Edge or SASE solutions. As we anticipate further customer demand for enhanced connectivity to our HPE Aruba Intelligent Edge solutions. Last week, we also announced our purchase of Athonet, which strengthened our private networking capabilities to help enterprises and telcos accelerate 5G deployments. Through these acquisitions, we are creating one of the most complete cloud portfolios in private 5G and wireless connectivity areas we have identified for growth in coming years. These new private 5G capabilities will be integrated into our HPE GreenLake platform, enabling customers to combine their WiFi and private 5G into one subscription that can scale according to demand. Earlier in the first quarter, we also purchased technology from two companies that enhance our cloud computing and AI offerings. Next quarter, we will begin selling scalable compute software technologies from tile scale, introducing additional choice points for customers to meet their compute and data-intensive world needs. We also integrate -- we will also integrate the packet reproducible AI software with our supercomputing AI solutions to further expand our AI at scale capabilities. We will continue to assess organic and inorganic investments that improve our competitive position in growth markets while driving higher level of recurring revenue and profitability. As always, we follow a disciplined return-based framework to build on our track record of creating sustainable long-term value for shareholders. Since we began the transformation of our business in 2019 to become the edge to cloud company, we have consistently grown our other service business, underpinned by the HPE GreenLake platform. The relevance of HPE GreenLake with customers, combined with our disciplined execution, has propelled both AI and our as-a-Service total contract value higher. Over the last two years, we have more than doubled our as-a-Service total contract value, reaching nearly $10 billion through the end of this quarter. These milestones prove the momentum in our transformation. During the first quarter, we once again increased our new HPE Green logos, growing our customer base by 7%, while as-a-Service order this quarter declined 20% year-over-year, it is important to keep in mind that the order figure is compared to prior year growth of a record 136%. One HPE GreenLake customer we recently highlighted is the 2023 Ryder Cup, which announced HPE will deliver an intelligent, secure and flexible high-performance network to our platform at the September 2023 golf event in Rome. Our platform will enable the Ryder Cup to deliver the tournament as-a-Service in a sustainable cost-efficient way while significantly enhancing the spectator experience and engagement. We have continued our investment in HP GreenLake, expanding our cloud services portfolio and partner ecosystem. In December, at our HPE Discover Frankfurt customer event in Germany, we announced our latest enhancements and the new cloud platform services capabilities in the data analytics, developer and sustainability areas. Our HPE GreenLake platform continue to attract business and drive performance across the portfolio. In every one of our key segments during the first quarter, we produced more revenues as well as positive operating profit. Let me provide you a few highlights. In our Intelligent Edge segment, revenue increased 31% year-over-year. We continue to see customers switch to our HPE Aruba technology from other vendors. We provide a single AI-driven cloud management experience, which is now part of HPE GreenLake platform with easy-of-use improving cost benefits. Year-over-year revenue growth was even higher in our HPC and AI segment, up 37% as we book revenue associated with Frontier, the world's first Exascale system. HPE is the clear market leader and has significant growth opportunities as enterprises scale AI models. AI will transform the IT landscape in the coming years and is a generation of technology shift like web, mobile and cloud that have the potential to disrupt existing business models. Supercomputing will be essential to enabling this disruption. For example, building a viable generative large language model for search would require a supercomputer to run the model continuously to stay current and improve accuracy. Our HPC and AI business has strong IP in the case of experience that give HPE a competitive advantage in building large computing systems, which are required to increase social adoption of AI models globally. We recognize AI will become the dominant supercomputing world load, while we acquired the market leader Cray in 2019. And continue to invest in key technology innovation that will enable these AI models at scale. Key examples are our acquisition of Determined AI in 2021 and Pachyderm early this year. While either unique and differentiated software to help our customer strength AI models and automate data pipelines. Customer recognized this leadership. For example, Aleph Alpha, a German startup building a commercial large language model has turned to HPE. We're also working with customers across industry verticals such as life sciences, aerospace to have new breakthroughs with AI. In the quarters ahead, we anticipate sharing more news on how we are scaling in this market and attracting new customers. I'm also pleased with the strong and steady performance of HPE Financial Services, which grew revenue 8% and financing volumes 21% year-over-year. Last month, we announced the retirement of our long-standing leader of this business, Rotman, and the promotion of Gerri Gold to take helm and further accelerate the business momentum. Gerri and her team recently launched a special financing program for customers who score high in ESG, and we are seeing great customer and partner response already. I am very proud of how the \u2013 our HPE team members have executed to achieve this quarter's exceptional plans, especially given the uneven macro environment. We have kicked off fiscal year 2023 with another set of standout results, giving us the confidence to raise our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance for the full fiscal year. Our customers have responded to the hybrid cloud value proposition we uniquely provide as they seek better ways to drive value from data from a cloud. We are attracting more customers and executing with discipline. As we look forward, we remain laser-focused on executing our winning strategy, which is delivering unmatched innovation and significant results for our customers and shareholders. We are confident in our strategy and execution for the long term. Let me now ask Tarek to give details on our business segments and greater visibility into our updated financial outlook. So, Tarek, over to you. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. Q1 2023 was, as Antonio said, a record quarter for HPE. As usual, I will reference slides some earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q1 2023 on slide 4. Let me discuss our Q1 performance details, starting with slide 5. We are very pleased that the execution of our strategy has driven record quarterly results in terms of revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS for a first quarter of a financial year. These and other records I referenced are primarily since we reset our strategy with our 2017 spin-off transactions. Notably, revenues grew year-over-year across all our business segments, Save for corporate in Q1 2023, as we benefited from improvements in the supply environment. Our supply chain execution is solid, we have very strong momentum, thanks to our substantial order book and our investments are bearing fruit, and we are gaining share in specific at segments. In short, our strategy is working and working really well. Having said so, while we are optimistic about our fiscal year 2023, we're all realistic. Overall, we have experienced above-trend demand through much of the past two years as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year 2022 period. And now market demand has shifted from being steady across our portfolio to being uneven over the course of Q1 2023. More specifically, deal velocity for Compute has slowed as customers digest the investments of the past two years, though demand for our storage and HPCI solutions is holding and demand for our edge solutions remains healthy. In that context, we are taking action to maintain our momentum for the second half of 2023 and fiscal year 2024. We intend to further our investments in software and services in all our business units including in our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform, HPC AI, storage and edge to extend our share gains across our segments, all while retaining our cost discipline and productivity focused. We delivered Q1 revenue of $7.8 billion, which equates to a robust 12% year-over-year growth and 18% in constant currency despite our exit from Russia and Belarus in Q2 2022. We did not experience a typical seasonal decline between Q4 and Q1, thanks to excellent supply chain execution on our large order book. Each of our segments excluding only our corporate segment grew revenue at least 8% in constant currency. This revenue performance was well above our prior guidance for Q1 of $7.2 billion to $7.6 billion and represented a record Q1 revenue level. We benefited from improvements in the supply environment, particularly in our Compute segment. This allowed us to execute against our order book, which our customers greatly appreciated. The delivery times of our products and services across our portfolio are now almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Yet we continue to have more progress to make in supply chain productivity as our order book entering Q2 2023 is more than twice normal level across our company. The combination of our large order book and improved supply environment gives us confidence that we can grow revenues well above the previously communicated guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency for fiscal year 2023. More on that later. As a result, we also a confidence in the longer term 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025 period, we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting last October. Our non-GAAP gross margin reached a Q1 record of 34.2%. This is up 30 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially. Our margin structure has benefited from pricing actions we have taken over the course of the pandemic, combined with the beginnings of declines in commodities and logistics costs  Over the long-term, our margin structure will continue to benefit as we continue to shift our mix of business to higher margin software-intensive as-a-Service offerings. Our non-GAAP operating margins reached a record high 11.8%. This is 80 basis points ahead of Q1 2022 and 30 basis points higher than Q4 2022. While strong revenue growth and gross margin performance are key drivers, this result would not have been possible without the strategic actions. Antonio and I took in fiscal year 2020 to reallocate resources and optimize our cost structure. As mentioned during our last earnings call, Antonio and I remain determined to maintain our focus on productivity. Our top line and margin strength in Q1 translated to GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.63. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS easily exceeded our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.58 and was another company record. Our Q1 2023 free cash flow was negative $1.3 billion. We typically have seasonal outflows in our Q1. We will discuss cash flow in more detail in a moment. But having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal year 2023. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $156 million in dividend this quarter and repurchased $73 million in stock. We intend to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023, just like we did in fiscal year 2022. Turning on to our as-a-Service business performance. We are very pleased to announce our ARR surpassed $1 billion in Q1 2023. This is an important milestone for our business that reflects that our as-a-service strategy is working. The supply chain challenges have slowed our ARR growth in prior quarters. The benefits of easing supply challenges are beginning to appear in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 2022 to 31% in Q1 2023. We expect further acceleration through fiscal year 2023 as improving supply allows us to expedite delivery of as-a-service solutions to our customers. Our as-a-service order decline of 20% in Q1 is a function of a difficult compare to Q1 2022, in which orders grew 136% on strength from several large deals, including a large public cloud customer. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline of as-a-Service business. We base this confidence on our 68% order growth in fiscal year 2022, the number of deals currently pending acceptance and our current view of the sales funnel. We, therefore, retain our three-year ARR target of 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-Service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q1 2023, our mix of software and services increased another 150 basis points year-over-year to 65%, thanks to our cloud and SaaS offerings, particularly in edge and storage. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we delivered a second consecutive record revenue quarter and surpassed the $1 billion revenue milestone for the first time. We grew our revenue 31% year-over-year. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share with our combination of wireless LAN, enterprise switching and SD-WAN solutions, including in some of the largest enterprise customers. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as our edge service platform, automation suite. Our operating margin of 21.9% was up 450 basis points annually and 860 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and our prior price increases have worked through our order book. We are very, very pleased that our edge business has exceeded the rule of 40 this quarter and feel very optimistic about the prospects of our Aruba business in fiscal year 2023 and beyond, given its substantial order book underpinned by a superior platform-based SaaS offerings. We retain confidence in our long-term targets of mid-teens revenue growth and mid-20% operating margins. In HPC and AI, revenue grew 37% year-over-year. We successfully closed the balance of the Frontier deal in Q1, which contributed to the strength of this business in Q1 2023. While the segment is also now benefiting from easing supply chain, the lumpiness and long lead times of this business mean that operating margins will continue to fluctuate. As Antonio mentioned, we have been thinking strategically about and investing behind Artificial Intelligence for many years. This is true both organically and inorganically. The emergence of large language models such as ChatGPT and BART and generative AI, some of which run on our systems has prompted many questions from our customer base. We believe AI at scale is a high-growth market and then the building and refinement of AI models will require unique computational capabilities that our Cray supercomputers and HPI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We intend to invest organically and inorganically as listed by our acquisition of Pachyderm to fully grasp this opportunity. With regards to storage, we are pleased to report 10% annual growth, where we are bolstering our portfolio to grow market share. HPE Alletra remains one of our fastest-growing new product introductions ever, and grew well above triple-digits in Q1. HPE Alletra contributed to double-digit growth in our own IP products, which is driving a mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-Service revenue. We continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit. And as a result, our Q1 operating margin of 12% is down 190 basis points year-over-year. Compute revenues grew 19% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. The segment benefited from the multi-sourcing and demand steaming initiatives we have discussed in prior calls as well as steadily improving supply availability. Our dynamic pricing strategy has helped us navigate a volatile supply climate while driving industry-leading gross margins. Our Compute operating margin of 17.6% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the fifth consecutive quarter, which attests to our best-in-class performance. We do believe our Compute operating margins are peaking and should gradually return to our target range of 11% to 13%. While we are seeing commodities costs decreasing, leading to increased competitive price pressure, we have for the first time three concurrent and differentiated platforms being sold in the market, Gen10, Gen10 Plus and Gen11, which would allow a gradual management of pricing and margins over time. In our Pointnext Operational Services business, combined with Storage services, orders declined mid- to high single-digits and revenues were flat year-over-year, driven by uneven demand. As you know, this is a key component of recurring revenues and profit for each of our segments. Finally, HPE Financial Services revenues rose 8% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.6 billion grew 21% in constant currency. Our operating margins fell 300 basis points year-over-year due to the higher interest rate climate that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, our HPFS business has proven resilience in downturn, thanks to the quality of the underwriting of the book of business. Throughout the pandemic, I'd like to remind you, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our loss ratio is back to pre-pandemic levels of approximately 50 basis points. Slide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased that the progress we are making again our edge-to-cloud strategy is evidence in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to record or near-record levels in Q1 2023. This illustrates not only the commercial success of our products in the marketplace, but also our ability to generate healthy margins. I am particularly pleased to see that our focus on supply chain execution has enabled the attainment of record revenues despite a substantial year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange rates that impacted revenue growth by 550 basis points in Q1 2023. Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q1 2023 non-GAAP gross margin is up 30 basis points year-over-year. We generated $2.7 billion in gross profit in Q1 2023, which is yet another quarterly record. Our gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of our strategic pricing actions through the period of supply challenges in fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022. It is also illustrative of the long-term favorable mix shift we are driving. Despite a strong compute quarter, our revenue mix of computing at 44% was flat year-over-year. This illustrates that we have a larger revenue base as our higher-margin segments are growing rapidly, and our as-a-service strategy is gaining momentum. Slide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margins for which reached 11.8% in Q1 '23. This is up 30 basis points sequentially and 80 basis points year-over-year. It is also a record quarterly non-GAAP operating margin for the company. Our very strong Q1 revenue performance and our resilient gross margins are the leading contributors to the operating margin expansion. Unlike many tech companies that have announced layoffs recently, we have strong momentum at HPE with a combination of our improved cost structure, substantial order book and outstanding execution, delivering profitable growth that is increasingly recurring at higher margins as our as-a-service transformation continues to unfold. Again, let me reiterate that Antonio and I are determined to maintain this focus on profitable growth and productivity for the future. Let's now turn to discuss H3C. As you know, we've chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We took this decision to carefully weigh the financial implications of remaining in the joint venture with the risk-reward profile of exercising the put. We are confident that we have made the decision that is in the best interest of our shareholders. HPE and our partner, Unisplendour continue to have strive discussions to reach agreement on the determination of the final purchase price of HPE shares in HPC and enter into a share purchase agreement. We will keep you updated \u2013 please keep in mind that, our decision to exercise the put is distinct from the commercial agreements with H3C. We intend to continue to do business in China through both our direct sales and through H3C and we remain committed to serving our customers in China. I would like to remind you that, we will continue to recognize the value of the dividends we received from H3C in our financials until the transaction is complete and I'm happy to report H3C results remains healthy despite uncertainty in the Chinese economy. Our first fiscal year from a cash flow perspective is typically a down quarter for cash flow. In Q1 2023, we had outflows of $800 million in cash flow from operations. And $1.3 billion in free cash flow. Working capital was a use of cash due to timing of receipts, payments, and continue investments in inventory, which has driven our cash flow conversion cycle from negative 14 days in Q4 to positive 15 days in Q1 2023. More specifically, our accounts payable balance was reduced by $2.2 billion quarter-over-quarter and was the main driver for negative operating cash flow and affected our cash flow conversion cycle. Also we have made significant investment in HPEFS volumes to drive future growth in subsequent quarters. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year 2023 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Now let's turn to our outlook slide on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q1 2023 across our business than it was in Q4 2022. Having said that, we also believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains and are entering Q2 2023 with a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. We have strong momentum in Q1 2023 and we are now turning our focus to invest in sustaining that momentum in the second half of 2023 and fiscal year 2024 in a context of continuous macroeconomic uncertainty. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure, or exit from Russia and Belarus in 2022 and foreign exchange risk. I would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. For Q2 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion at every point of the range. This represents 9% year-over-year growth in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.27 to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.52. This outlook assumes the current level of demand we have been experiencing remain unchanged. And then we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book. To sum it up, I am very pleased with our Q1 results and guidance for Q2. We also understand some of our end markets are likely to remain uneven in the near-term. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in fiscal year 2023 is likely to be more weighted \u2013 more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. Given the strong Q1 performance, momentum and substantial order book we continue to have, we are lifting our full year guidance accordingly. We are now targeting 5% to 7% revenue growth adjusted for currency, which is at the midpoint, twice our prior revenue growth guidance, non-GAAP operating profit growth of 5% to 6%, GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.40 to $1.48. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.02 to $2.10 and free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Specifically for OI&E, we benefited in Q1 2023 from one-off foreign exchange gains that accounted for $0.02 to $0.03 per share. These are unlikely to repeat in the rest of the fiscal year. Given the high interest rate environment is expected to remain unchanged, we expect OI&E to be an expense of $20 million to $40 million on a full year basis. This explains our fiscal year 2023 EPS guidance range of $2.02 to $2.10, which incorporates $0.06 of the $0.09 beat in Q1 2023. In terms of capital returns, we will return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. We are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. So to conclude, our results speak for themselves, and we continue to execute better than the competition. While many tech companies are playing defense with layoffs, we see fiscal year 2023 as an opportunity to accelerate the execution of our strategy. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. You may now go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. And congrats on the solid performance. I guess, I wanted to ask a question more strategically in kind of thinking about the product portfolio. You guys and many others, obviously talking a lot about ChatGPT, GTP and Generative AI. In the conversation on today's call, you alluded to the fact that you're well positioned with some of your HPC and your high-performance compute platforms. And I want to make sure I understood what you're saying a little bit correct. Are you participating in some of the infrastructure in some of the cloud opportunities, or how do you see yourself participating in kind of these AI investments that really seem to be driving this narrative around meaningful deployments of accelerated compute? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Aaron. Obviously, AI is now front and center in the IT community, because of what we saw in the last couple of months. And as I said, has the potential to disrupt every industry. We cannot talk about what specific cloud, that is one specific cloud they use our specific Cray systems. But I will say, we have a bigger opportunity than that because when I think about the deployment of these large language models that require supercomputing capacity. And at that point, when you think about what we did with Frontier is how we make that accessible to every enterprise of every size. And so we, as a company, have a unique opportunity that happens every softer where there is a massive inflection point like AI and LLM, right, the large language model with a unique differentiation in our IP, which is a combination of organic assets that we built over a number of years and the acquisition of Cray. So as Tarek started sending his remarks, we are assessing what is the type of business model we can deploy as a part of our as-a-service model. By offering, what I call a cloud supercomputing IS layer with a platform-as-a-service that ultimate developers can develop, train and deploy these large models at scale. So that's why we said early on, we will talk more about that in the subsequent quarters. But we are very well positioned, and we have a very large pipeline of customers. Last week, I was in Europe, and I was amazed to see the large pipeline customers that they are demanding that. And I mentioned one specific customer, Aleph Alpha which is already coming to us to do that. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Anthony \u2013 thank you, Aaron. Next question, Anthony, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. You noted, obviously, seeing some weakness kind of in the environment. Just wanted to get a sense of either customer type or vertical or just kind of segment that you've got to kind of see be the source that kind of weakness throughout the year? And are you seeing more people kind of opt for GreenLake subscription offerings as a result of kind of more macro sensitivity? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Sure. I mean, I don't think there is one specific geography or one specific segment. I will say, as we said in the early remarks, right, the Compute business, obviously, we see a little bit more unevenness, if you will, with longer sales cycles because also they are digested all what they acquired last year, because of the supply chain and the cost rising. But when you look at the rest of the segments, as Tarek said and I said, the Intelligent Edge business, the Connectivity business, is very, very solid. And we exited once again in Q1 with an extremely elevated book of orders. HPC, we just talked about it, right? We see an amazing pipeline in front of us. We have only deployed one exascale system, and we have few to go because we are delivering all of them to the Department of Energy. And then as I said earlier, right, we have an opportunity to grow that business through an as-a-Service model. But that said, what customers are telling me is that they need a hybrid cloud experience. And we see, in some cases, repatriation of workloads on-prem, but they want the same cloud experience with the same consumption model, and that's what GreenLake does extremely well. It's a true hybrid cloud experience for low-dose overloads, where data, data compliance and cost plays a big role, and that's why we see the momentum we have. The fact that we doubled the total contract value from Q1 2021 to Q1 2023 from $5 billion to $10 billion, it tells you the momentum. What I'm really pleased is the fact that two-third of that momentum is in software and services, which means we will be more resilient as we go forward to weather some of these challenges because it's a recurring revenue. And we count in that, just to be clear, through Software-as-a-Service subscription and consumption, which is exactly the way it's supposed to be. And that's why we are very bullish about our GreenLake and the fact that we crossed $1 billion ARR, it's just a testament that we have a winning strategy. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Meta. Next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the execution here. I guess my question was more on the full year guide, and I understand some of the headwinds in certain segments that you're calling out, but the revenue guide goes up by about sort of 300 basis points for the year. The operating profit growth sort of goes up by 100 basis points. And while I understand some of the headwinds, what maybe I can use some help on is really understand the mix implications of how you're thinking about it, just given the more lower sort of flow-through that we're seeing to operating profit growth for the full year guide? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Sure. So thank you for remarking that our revenue guide at the midpoint is effectively doubling from the prior guide that we gave. The prior guide that we gave was 2% to 4%. We're now guiding 5% to 7%. So at the midpoint, it is 6%, which is double what we gave previously. And in giving that guide, we factor in a number of elements. First of all, the macro environment, second of all foreign exchange rates; and third of all, our desire to continue to invest to perpetrate the momentum that we have in the second half and in fiscal year 2024 because there's always something else that we have to think about for the end of the year, and we're not done yet. I also want to flag that we believe that commodity costs are coming down in particular areas, which should effectively come with added pricing pressure in compute, and this is also something that we have factored into our guidance. But if you really think about our non-GAAP operating profit growth. The prior guide was at 4% to 5% growth, and now we're guiding 5% to 6% growth, and we feel comfortable with the information we have on the macro, foreign exchange cetera, that our guide is appropriate. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Samik. Next question. Operator : Our next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. You may now go ahead. Kyle McNealy : Great. Thanks for the question. It was a great quarter for Intelligent Edge. Can you help us understand how we should think about a big quarter here in Q1? Is that level sustainable going forward, or was there some big deals or particular activity that you would call out that isn't likely to repeat. Your guidance implies it decelerates from here, but -- can you give us a sense for how we should model this going forward and how frequently you might see growth ahead of your mid-teens growth guidance? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Kyle. No, there was not a unique deal. This is the continuous momentum we have had now for a number of quarters. The book of business in this particular business segment continue to be extremely renovated. As Tarek said, we continue to gain share. And I think it's because we have a unique value proposition, which is a cloud native offer for all aspects of connectivity. We announced now the acquisition of Athonet, which we will integrate the private 5G into the same control plane. And today, we announced the acquisition of Access Security, which is the secure access secure edge at the top. And so when we think about the book of business, the incredible pipeline we have ahead of us, the execution of the team, the easing of the supply, although in this particular business, there is a little bit more constrained on the supply compared to the other businesses. We talk about a Rule of 40, and this was the Rule of 50 something, I guess. But the fact of the matter is that, as Tarek said, we expect to grow double-digits, right? And in the mid-20s on operating profit. This business is now humming and it's going to be one of the most important growth engine as we go in the future. And as Tarek said, it's also allowing us to be less reliant on the rest of the portfolio, which is very, very critical. And this comes with a high gross margin, obviously. Tarek Robbiati : I would simply add to what Antonio said, look, the edge have broken the $1 billion revenue bar. I think now we are entering a phase with all the additions that we're making to the portfolio. We're entering a phase of a new watermark level. We have built at the edge with Antonio and the management team, one of the most comprehensive portfolio of the entire industry. And it is really, really winning shares even in the largest customer segments, thanks to the Edge-to-Cloud platform that Aruba has built and that powers GreenLake in everything we do. Antonio Neri : And I hope the market will take notice of that and give us a little bit of recognition about the work we have done in this particular segment. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Kyle. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may now go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I know this is going to be a bit of a tricky one, but I want to see if you could help us understand why your view sound more optimistic than your other IT-exposed peers, whether it's around, in particular, the Compute side of the business as a storage. I get Intelligent Edge, so I'm not really pushing there. But just the contrast in your outlook on storage and compute versus some of your peers. Can you help us understand that? Antonio Neri : Sure. Thank you, Simon. Well, first of all, let me start by saying, we have a unique strategy and a very diversified portfolio. Some of our competitors don't have the breadth and depth of our portfolio. Some of them are just playing compute and storage, some of them play just in storage, some of them only play in networking. And by the way, let's remind ourselves that one-third of our recurring revenues come from services, which is unique in our space. So we have a unique portfolio, which is incredibly relevant in the mega trends we see in the market. But we have done really well, I will say, Simon, is we brought all that unique portfolio in an integrated solution and experience through HPE GreenLake. And now the HPE GreenLake is a winning strategy for us, because it's very hard to do. One thing is to offer just a subscription model on some sort of solution. But when you leverage a true as-a-service model across all line of businesses, let me remind you, architecturally, I drove a vision with the team that everything we do, whether you consume it as a service or you consume it in a traditional way, that entire experience is delivered now to HPE GreenLake. Whether you deploy a compute node somewhere, whether in the cloud or premise or at the edge, you need a subscription to that compute node. Whether it's the storage business. Now you asked about the storage. This product, HPE Alletra and Tarek mentioned this, is the fastest product in the history of the company, has grown triple digits on a consistent basis. And you will see more announcement about this platform going forward, but it was conceived to be a SaaS-led offer. And so that's why it's fueling also the recurrent revenue as we go forward. And I think the combination of that gives the customers a unique experience instead of buying three different things for people, they can consume it all through one integrated experience. And that's why we are confident. Now on the compute side, obviously, that compute business go through their own processes and cycles, right, because we have CPUs that come on and off at different time of the year or years. But Tarek said, we have three concurrent platforms going on that gives us a lot of flexibility to attack specific customer segments with different configure and pricing. And generation 11 is unique because we address three specific needs, the hybrid cloud need, the security they need and the workload optimization. And it comes with unique technologies that actually lift the UP, because now it's more structural, because we're adding DDR5 memory, which basically means more content into the server. And that's why we believe we can manage through this transition. But, I mean, if you look at the performance of that business, it was best in class, 90% year-over-year growth and an amazing 17.6% operating profit. And when you look at some of our competitors, as a combined business, not even come to the same number we delivered just on compute. Jeff Kvaal : Simon, thanks very much. Let\u2019s move to the next question, please. Operator : Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may now go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. I was wondering if you could just talk about what's the timing for the H3C transaction from here? And then how do you think about the usage of the proceeds that you get from here? Because, I think, if you sell the stake you have, it would be dilutive by about $0.17 to $0.18 of EPS line. So I'm just wondering, how do you think about using the proceeds and offsetting the dilution potentially? Thank you. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. So thank you, Amit, for the question on H3C. We exercised the put, as you recall, towards the end of the calendar year of 2022. And we are right now in the process of agreeing the value of our stake with our partners of Unigroup. And this process is going to take a few month and it's going to -- we expect it to complete towards the end of calendar year 2023, and we feel reasonably good about the prospects. For the meantime, we continue to consolidate H3C and benefit from the dividends that we received from the company. And we are not deconsolidating H3C at this stage. It's most likely going to be the case of the end of fiscal year 2023 when that will happen. And at that point, we will advise both on the impact of dilution from deconsolidation and also the use of proceeds once we receive them. I would like to also emphasize that we continue to have commercial agreements with H3C, notwithstanding, the exercise of the put, those commercial agreements are distinct from the exercise of the put, and we will continue to generate value through those commercial agreements that we have with H3C. Antonio Neri : Yeah. And as always, I mean, listen, we're going to apply the same discipline for returning capital to shareholders and continue to invest in the business at the appropriate time. But until we finish this process, right, it's just emphasizing. We have to go through the process and complete the agreement. Jeff Kvaal : Amit, thank you. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You may now go ahead. Sidney Ho : Great. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. So I also have a question on the full year guide being up 3% to 6% -- I think it's 5% to 7%. And, obviously, impressive compared to our peer, who just downtake earlier today. But if I look at the midpoint, take a midpoint of your fiscal second quarter guidance, it would assume the second half of the year will be down slightly from the first half, which is kind of unseasonal, right? It's normal seasonality is up, call it, 5%. Can you talk about what's embedded in your second half revenue guidance? Is that all driven by your view on the macro side, any one-time item that we should be thinking about in the first half? And maybe how we should think about the backlog helping -- delivering from your backlog offset some of the demand weakness from half-over-half basis at the standpoint? Thanks. Tarek Robbiati : Okay. A lot of questions into one question, but I will try my best. So first and foremost, the revenue growth that we are targeting for the full year is 5% to 7%, which at the midpoint is 6%, which is double what we originally anticipated. And that is because of all the puts and takes in our portfolio and the way we see supply easing on one side, also demand continuing unevenly although across our portfolio. And if you really look at our EPS guide, one thing I would like to emphasize for everyone on the call is that we did beat the midpoint of our guide by $0.09 and $0.03 of that beat pertained to OI&E and had to do with foreign exchange gains that are not operational. We continue to view OI&E on the full year basis being an expense of US$20 million to US$40 million due to elevated interest expenses. And there is also in our guidance, the potential impact from FX volatility. And so what is baked into our guidance is just that our current view to the best of our knowledge, of the macro environment, the impact of interest rates and also the impact of foreign exchange rates that we see at this stage, knowing that things can evolve. It's also important to note that this is our first quarter. We still have nine months to go, and we want to make sure that we remain prudent in the current circumstance where the macro environment remains uncertain. Jeff Kvaal : Sidney, thanks very much, and we'll take two more questions, Anthony? Operator : Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may now go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about how much incremental order's in your backlog you were able to satisfy versus what you had anticipated going into the quarter given the fact that some of these supply chain improvements came through the course of the quarter? And can you also maybe help us think through what you're expecting from an FX headwind now in fiscal 2023 relative to your SAM guide of a $0.30 headwind to EPS. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Wamsi. I will answer the first part and Tarek, on the second part. I mean not enough. I mean, the fact of the matter is that we made some progress, but not enough progress against that very strong order book. And that's why we exit Q1 with 2x normal historical levels. Now, we expect that to continue to improve, obviously, throughout the years as supply continue to ease. But again, we have a good pipeline in front of us. And so the goal is to continue to fill the order book. But when you ask me about how much progress we made in Q1, not enough. If you look at our Intelligent Edge business is extremely elevated. Our HPC business, when I look about the future deliveries we have to live is always very, very strong. Storage is good, and Compute is still there. So we have work to do, more work to do. And then on FX, I think -- Tarek Robbiati : Oh, yes. Thank you, Antonio, and thank you, Wamsi. This gives me the opportunity to remind everybody that at SAM in last October, we flagged at least a $0.30 headwind from foreign exchange this fiscal year. Quite honestly, the headwind we have experienced in this quarter of 550 basis points is above what we anticipated. We still feel that we can attain our new guide on revenue growth and EPS, notwithstanding the current FX headwinds and but things can always evolve and this is why we remain prudent in our full year guide, with regards to revenue and EPS growth. So that 30-plus percent EPS impact from FX has risen, but we are managing it and factoring it into our new guide. Antonio Neri : I mean, on that point, I think it's simply remarkable because we have to cover all of that $0.30 started right operationally. Tarek Robbiati : Yes. Antonio Neri : The fact that, we are raising the midpoint from the $2, which included a $0.30 headwind now $2.06. It shows you that the mix of the business is going in the right direction, the expansion of the margins and the productivity we continue to drive. Despite the fact the FX actually got worse at the time. And the 550 basis point is pretty significant. So I think from our vantage point, we are doing all the right things and we're confident in that guidance we just provided to you. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much, Wamsi. And Anthony, last question, please. Operator : Our final question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. You may now go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Really appreciate it. Antonio, I would love to get any context you can provide going back to the AI and large language model conversation. Is there any useful way for us to think about the required resources sort of difference and what you're seeing for those applications relative to kind of typical high-performance Compute application resources? And then are you also seeing for those AI type projects. Are you also seeing any impact to the storage attach? And then is there any networking attach impact there as well? Would just love context on those rates. Thanks a lot. Antonio Neri : No, thank you. Well, we have been in the AI business now for many years, right? So -- and we have been in the specific AI a scale business. One of the key differentiations we have in that business, actually several, right? Number one is the -- what you refer to as networking, I call it interconnect fabric. The ability to connect 40,000 GPUs at scale requires a unique differentiated fabric. That's what the Frontier system is all about. And as I think about the next generation of this, we can easily double to 80,000 GPUs because our software and our silicon scales to those levels. And so that's a unique value proposition that you don't get in the traditional commoditized cloud environment. The other key differentiation we have is the programming environment we acquired to the Cray acquisition because when you develop these AI models, you have to deploy and you have to manage it at scale to take advantage of the massive set of capabilities. That also is a unique software value proposition that's very hard to duplicate. And then last but not least, to be able to leverage all these wonderful capabilities, you have to be able to prepare the data. And the data pipeline requires a lot of work upfront because it has to be clean and compliance and all of that. And that's why our acquisitions like Determined AI and Pachyderm in particular, now allows us to automate that data pipeline. But we are not stopping there. We continue to move up and build what I call the platform as a service for developers, so they can take advantage of this automation for the data, train the models and then deploy the model. And if they need a supercomputing type of capabilities, we will be there for them. So that's why I said early on, we are a unique point in time, where an inflection in the market intersects a unique set of capabilities, which we intend to fully capitalize top to bottom. Not just on the hardware level, but all the way to the software level. And you will hear more about that as we come to the next months and quarters. And I'm really excited about that opportunity because we already have customers coming to us we need that, and they are generally enterprise customers that deploy these large case model that they don't want to spend hundreds of millions of dollars, but they want to use it as-a-Service. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. I always appreciate, you making the time to talk to us. I know today was an incredible busy day about all the earnings being posted. But let me remind you a couple of things. I mean, first of all, today, results is not a coincidence. It's a combination of many things we have done over a longer period of time. It is the fact that we have a unique strategy, we have been consistently executing with discipline at all levels, driving cost discipline, productivity, investing organically, and inorganically to bolster our unique portfolio aligned to those trends we discussed today. We generated a record performance in the first quarter for our shareholders. It was the highest revenue quarter since 2016. We delivered the best non-GAAP operating profit and the highest ever EPS net diluted earnings per share. And I believe we are very well-positioned to navigate this uneven market. As always, there is always more work to do, no question about that. But I think we have a world-class team; a unique culture and customers want us to be there for them through this tradition. So, thank you very much, and all forward to see you at the next call or in one of the conference calls we do with you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

My name is Chuck, and I\u2019ll be your conference moderator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to turn the conference over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Kirt Karros, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. Kirt Karros : Thank you, Chuck and good afternoon, good evening everyone. I\u2019m Kirt Karros, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I like to welcome you to our fiscal 2023 second quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tarek Robbiati, HPE\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes. We have posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying the release on our HPE investor relations web page. Elements of the financial information referenced on the call are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2023. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials related to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Please refer to HPE's filings with the SEC for a discussion of these risks. For financial information, we've expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency. Finally, after Antonio provides his high-level remarks, Tarek will be referencing the slides and our earnings presentation throughout his prepared remarks. With that, let me turn it over to you, Antonio. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Kirt, and good afternoon. Thank you everyone for joining today. In the second quarter, HPE increased total revenues, drove larger contributions from recurring revenues, and expanded overall profitability. I attribute this   two primary factors : First, our strategy to build our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas is working. And second, we are operating with strong discipline. In a market that continues to be dynamic, we grew our revenue 9% year-over-year to $7 billion. Our annualized revenue run rate or ARR increased 38% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. We grew year-over-year revenue across our key segments except in compute. With our Intelligent Edge and High Performance Computing and AI segments delivering particularly standout growth even though the potential in our HPC and AI segment was somewhat impacted by customer acceptance of certain large deals. HPE achieved exceptional profitability in the second quarter, increasing our non-GAAP gross margins a full 200 basis points to 36.2%, a new record. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift strategy supported by our operating discipline helped us generate a non-GAAP operating margin of 11.5%, up 220 basis points from a year ago. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share rose 18% year-over-year to $0.52 at the high-end of our second quarter outlook. Free cash flow generated in the quarter was nearly $290 million, an increase of about $500 million from the prior year. As a result of our second quarter performance and our expectations of profitability will increase this fiscal year, we are raising our full-year GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. Tarek will share further details about our full-year updated guidance, including operating profit expectations later in our call. Our portfolio diversification is a clear strength in winning the business of customers who are taking a data first approach to modernize their IT estates. The relevance of our strategy at the edge in hybrid cloud and in AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform is enabling us to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. In the second quarter, we saw some decline in the health of macroeconomic conditions, causing unevenness in customer demand, particularly in general purpose compute. We also see unevenness when comparing customer size, industry, or geography. European, Asian, and mid-sized company deals are holding up better than expected, while large enterprise businesses and customers in certain sectors such as financial services and manufacturing in North America have been more conservative with their spend. In the last few months, sales cycles have elongated because customers are more reluctant to quickly commit to large projects or some will seek additional internal approvals at the time of the order. We continue to focus on our soft processes to accelerate closing deals wherever possible. Our order book at the end of Q2 remains elevated at more than 1.5x the size of normalized historical levels. In the area of high growth, Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI, and HPE GreenLake business, order books are especially large. Before I provide some business highlights, I want to be sure you saw the announcement we made last Friday related to our relationship with H3C Technologies. After successfully closing negotiations, we announced that UNIS will purchase all our shares in H3C for $3.5 billion in cash, subject to certain required regulatory approvals and closing conditions. Importantly, from the China market perspective, we are pleased that we have agreed to the terms of a new go forward commercial agreement that we will enter with H3C. Tarek will share more in his remarks. Our HPE GreenLake platform continues to power the growth of our software infrastructure and services, capturing more than $10 billion in total contract value for the first time this quarter. HPE GreenLake also drove our ARR to $1.1 billion in the second quarter with an increasing portion coming from margin rich software and services, which now is 66% over total ARR mix. Our other service business continue to expand our opportunities pipeline though orders this quarter dipped slightly 8% year-over-year. This was driven by a very tough competition to fiscal year Q2 2022 when orders more than doubled. We have had a great ramp with our HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise offering, which advances customers hybrid cloud environments with a consistent intuitive cloud operating experience. Global engineering company Danfoss selected HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise as a part of an effort to transform its global IT strategy. With HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise, the company bought its IT to an agile  environment that aligns the right workload on the right platform, all while significantly reducing the carbon footprint. We continue to innovate on the HPE GreenLake edge-to-cloud platform. To complement our organic innovation early this month we completed our acquisition of OpsRamp, whose hybrid digital operations management solutions have enhanced our HPE GreenLake platform by providing visibility, observability, and control across multi-vendor and multi-cloud IT environments. We are already getting very positive feedback from customers and partners. With the integration of OpsRamp technology into the HPE GreenLake in Q3, we enter a $39 billion IT operations management market. HPE GreenLake is a performance driver across our portfolio and we are seeing its value across our business segments. Let me provide a few segment highlights. Intelligent Edge had a standout quarter. HPE Aruba networking has exceeded our expectations in revenue and margin terms. In part because customers are adding more cloud software services to recently deliver infrastructure, which will add to recurring revenue in future quarters. This is the second consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion in revenue in this segment and the eleventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. We continue to drive innovation and expand our addressable market at the edge. Through our acquisition of cloud security provider Axis Security, we have expanded our SASE, Secure Access Service Edge offering. And with a soon to close purchase of Athonet, we are doubling down on private 5G. The combination of Axis Security, Athonet, and our world-class HPE Aruba Network and Intelligent Edge capabilities gives HPE one of the most comprehensive connected edge portfolios in the market. We expect this business to continue to grow in the quarters ahead. In our HPC & AI\u2019s business, we saw a significant sequential increase in orders this quarter, with a noteworthy uptick across customer segments from Fortune 500 companies including a large cloud provider to digital native start-ups looking for optimized AI supercomputing solutions. HP is winning in AI because we deliver an end-to-end portfolio designed for the full spectrum of enterprise   and used cases spanning large scale model development, training, and inferencing. Customers are attracted to HPE's market leading super computing capabilities, differentiated Interconnect IP, AI specific software, and services expertise. Since the start of the second quarter, we have won multiple large contracts, totaling more than $800 million from large cloud providers and enterprise customers that will develop, train, and run AI models. Most of these contracts exceed $100 million each. We expect this pipeline to continue to grow and anticipate these deals will generate significant revenue in later quarters. For example, in Q2,  (ph) and AI focused deal with Crusoe Energy, a cloud provider pioneered in infrastructure that taps into stranded energy like wasted methane or tractor renewable energy to power compute resources. Using HPE Cray supercomputers as a generative AI foundation, Crusoe will enable customers to train and  scale AI models in a sustainable way. Crusoe's mission is to align the future of computing with the future of the climate and this deal enables a significant offering of a climate aligned supercomputer service solution. Just last week, the Top 500 supercomputer list was released. And HPE Systems comprised more than one-third of the Top 100 most powerful systems in the world, including Frontier in the number one spot. In this latest evaluation, the performance of Frontier, the world\u2019s first exascale supercomputer jumped by another 8%. In the quarter, we recognized a portion of the total revenue of our second exascale system called Aurora for Argonne National Laboratory. Aurora will develop a series of generative AI models to run on HPE Cray EX supercomputer, which includes HPE Slingshot, a proven Ethernet interconnect that can scale to the systems more than 60,000 GPUs and more than 21,000 CPUs. Aurora is expected to deliver more than two exaflops of peak performance computing. Argonne plans to open the generative AI models to scientific community for a range of research, including an initial focus on accelerating drug discovery and cancer research. AI is a significant profitable growth opportunity for HPE and our shareholders in a space where HPE has unique differentiation evident in the momentum of our business.  In just few weeks, we will host our annual customer event HPE Discover, where we will make breakthrough announcements in HPE GreenLake, hybrid cloud NAI solutions that we anticipate will accelerate the demand for a differentiated portfolio. We hope many of you will join us in Las Vegas to see our strategy and diverse offerings come to life firsthand. In our storage segment, our pivotal IP-owned products continue to get traction in the market, shown by the impressive ramp of HPE Alletra offerings. HPE Alletra revenue increased more than 100% year-over-year. In April, we announced new storage services HPE GreenLake for block storage and HPE GreenLake for file storage. The new services leverage HPE Alletra storage simplified data lifecycle management with an intuitive cloud operations to store manage and protect customer's data wherever it resides. In the month between launch and the close of the quarter, customer orders for the solutions were strong. For example, the Dallas Cowboys selected HPE GreenLake for block storage because they believe the simple management, efficient scale, and high performance delivered by a new solution will add even more value to their IT operations that customer experience. In compute, our continued focus on pricing discipline has added to the segment's profit contribution. We continue to see some sluggishness from large accounts, many of which have placed large orders with industry supply was more constrained. As we look ahead, we are focused on unit growth in other segment of the market. We are executing our strategy and delivering strong results, including year-over-year revenue growth, record gross margin, and expanded earnings. HPE's year-over-year revenue growth, earnings per share expansion, and consistent increase in ARR contribution over the last two-plus years demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy and shift in our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-margin areas, rich in software and services. Our strong operational discipline continues to drive operating leverage across the company. I'm personally proud of the 60,000 team members for its commitment to both think and innovation is helping our customers achieve their goals. Our customers are counting on HPE as a key partner to help them capture opportunities ahead from the edge to hybrid cloud to AI. While the macroeconomic environment may introduce more uncertainty in the short-term, I am confident that our winning strategy, diverse portfolio, and continued innovation position us well to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I now would like Tarek to provide business segment details and specifics about our progress. So Tarek, over to you. Tarek Robbiati : Thank you very much, Antonio. I will start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. As usual, I will reference slides from our earnings presentation to guide you through our performance. Antonio discussed key highlights for Q2 2023 on Slide 4. Let me discuss our Q2 performance details, starting with Slide 5. I would characterize this quarter as solid overall despite the uneven demand indicators across our portfolio, particularly in Compute, with continued demand and outstanding performance in our Intelligent Edge business as a standout. We are very pleased that we are successfully driving further diversification of our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI, and HPE GreenLake solutions. During the quarter, net revenues grew 56% year-over-year in Edge, 22% year-over-year in HPC & AI, and the HPE GreenLake ARR grew 38% year-over-year, all in constant currency. The pivot of our portfolio towards higher-growth, higher-margin markets is clearly visible in the expansion of gross margins and our strategy is working. While we remain confident about our fiscal year 2023 and beyond, we are also realistic. Demand through much of the past two years has been above trend as attested by our growing order book over the fiscal year 2020 to 2022 period throughout our business, including Compute, which is very cyclical in nature. Demand shifted from fiscal year 2022 and to uneven in Q1 and was even more uneven in Q2 across our portfolio. While Q2 revenue of $7 billion equates to a healthy 4% year-over-year growth and 9% year-over-year growth in constant currency, revenues were below our prior guidance range of $7.1 billion to $7.5 billion. Deal velocity has slowed, particularly in North America and in Compute, and to a lesser extent in Storage. Deal cycles have elongated as customers primarily are larger compute customers digest their investments over the past two years. This trend has been particularly pronounced for compute in the manufacturing and financial services verticals in North America, in part as a result of the loss of confidence in the banking sector. In addition, HPC & AI was affected by several customer acceptances that slipped out of Q2. Despite this, we see several promising indicators. Demand in Q2 grew sequentially, led by HPC & AI and our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba. Aruba continues to grow revenues, both on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis. Overall demand in Compute in the mid-market is stable, including direct enterprise and the channel. Our overall order book at the start of Q3 remains elevated at more than 1.5x normalized historical levels, and we expect a strong momentum in Intelligent Edge to continue. And finally, AI demand is very solid, as you heard from Antonio, and materializing in our pipeline and our order book with several very large deals. More on that later. We also continue to take action to strengthen the portfolio mix shift inorganically across our businesses. We have closed the acquisitions of Axis Security and OpsRamp and are already winning deals with these assets as part of a broader HPE. I am particularly proud that we have finalized an agreement with our partners at UNIS for the sale of our 49% stake through the exercise of our put option for an amount of $3.5 billion. More on that later. In recognition of the Compute weakness, we are adjusting our previously communicated guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency. Nevertheless, the combination of our order book, ongoing strength and momentum in Edge and HPC & AI gives us confidence that we will deliver solid FY 2023 revenue growth and remain confident in the 2% to 4% revenue CAGR outlook over the FY 2022 to FY 2025 period that we provided at our 2022 Securities Analyst Meeting in October. Our non-GAAP gross margin reached a high watermark of 36.2%. This is up 200 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher-margin and software-intensive recurring revenue. Our Intelligent Edge business, Aruba was 19% of total revenue in Q2, up 580 basis points year-over-year. And with Q2 sequential revenue growth in Aruba at 15%, we expect Aruba to represent a larger portion of the company's gross and operating profits by the end of fiscal year 2023. As a result, our Q2 2023 non-GAAP operating margin reached 11.5%. This is 220 basis points ahead of Q2 2022 and down just  (ph) from a record performance in Q1 2023. In addition to the portfolio mix shift towards high-margin businesses, we remain focused on cost control and productivity. Antonio and I remain determined to maintain this focus and to grow revenues faster than OpEx over time. Our Q2 margin strength drove GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, at the high-end of our guidance range of $0.44 to $0.52. Q2 2023 free cash flow was positive $288 million, an improvement of nearly $500 million over Q2 2022 and $1.6 billion over Q1 2023. We will discuss cash flow in more details later. Having said that, we remain on track to generate between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion in free cash flow this fiscal year. Finally, we are continuing to return substantial capital to our shareholders. We paid $155 million in dividends and repurchased $106 million in stock this quarter and are on track to buy back at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. Our year-to-date total capital returns are  (ph), which reflects our confidence in future cash flow generation. Moving to Slide 6. We are very pleased to announce our pivot to as-a-service revenue continues to show strong momentum as ARR surpassed $1.1 billion in Q2 2023. The benefits of easing supply challenges are appearing in our results as ARR growth in constant currency accelerated from 25% in Q4 2022 to 31% in Q1 2023 and now 38% in Q2 2023. Our edge and storage SaaS offerings are the fastest growth components of our as-a-service portfolio. Our as-a-service order decline of 8% in Q2 2023 is a function of a tough compare to Q2 2022, in which orders grew 107% on strength of several large deals. We are comfortable with our robust pipeline, which includes very large enterprise AI wins we recently closed and reiterate our three-year ARR target of a 35% to 45% CAGR from fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year 2025. Most importantly, we continue to make our as-a-service business more valuable with a growing mix of higher-margin software and services recurring revenue. In Q2 2023, our mix of software and services increased another 220 basis points year-over-year to 66%. And we have attained a total TCV well in excess of $10 billion. Let's now turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. I would like to remind you that all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In the Intelligent Edge, we grew our revenue 56% year-over-year and exceeded the Rule of 40 for a second consecutive quarter. Most importantly, we grew revenues 15% sequentially and delivered record revenues for a fourth consecutive quarter. We are outgrowing our main competitors and are taking share in some of the largest enterprise customers who are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform. We have now closed our acquisition of Axis Security and are already generating SD-WAN and SASE wins in combination. Our acquisition of private 5G player Athonet is still pending, but already contributing to our pipeline of business. Our operating margin of 26.9% was up more than 1,400 basis points year-over-year and 500 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from scale and a solid order book that continues to grow. And as a result, we are optimistic about the prospects of our Intelligent Edge business in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. In HPC & AI, revenue grew 22% year-over-year. The emergence of large language models and generative AI has prompted many inquiries from our customer base during the past quarter, which are turning into pipeline and orders. In the past few months, we have multiple large enterprise AI wins totaling more than $800 million and counting. This includes large AI as-a-service deals under the GreenLake model. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our great supercomputers and HPC & AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. We expect the AI demand to drive healthy revenue growth in the future and intend to invest organically and inorganically to fully grasp this opportunity as our acquisitions of Determined AI and Pachyderm attest. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and non-linked times in this business means that operating margins in the business unit will continue to fluctuate. Storage revenue grew 2% year-over-year. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q2 for the fourth consecutive quarter, lifting our total all-flash array growth to 20% year-over-year. HPE Alletra is driving a long-term mix shift to higher-margin, software-intensive as-a-service revenue. We will continue to invest in R&D for our own IP products in this business unit such as our new file-as-a-service and Alletra MP offerings. Our Q2 2023 operating margin of 7.9% is down 390 basis points year-over-year as we navigate uneven demand and migrate to our software-defined HPE Alletra, which includes a significant component of SaaS ratable revenue. Compute revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $2.8 billion and down 20% sequentially. The  and demand softness I discussed previously was most prevalent in the Compute business as our large customers, particularly in manufacturing and financial services in North America, digest the investments they have made in recent years. Our Compute operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our long-term outlook of 11% to 13% for the sixth consecutive quarter, which attests to the quality of our historical book of business. While we are seeing decreasing commodities costs leading to increased competitive price pressure, we are selling three differentiated platforms in the market, Gen10, Gen10+, and Gen11, which should allow a gradual management of margins over time. In HPE Services, which is within our Compute, HPC & AI and Storage segments and excluding HPE GreenLake, orders were down low single digits and revenues were flat year-over-year. HPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 17% in constant currency, driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 280 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest rate hikes and higher cost of funds that we will gradually offset over time through pricing. Time and time again, this business has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality of the underlying of the book of business. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%. Our Q2 loss ratio of 50 basis points was below full-year 2019 or pre-pandemic levels. Slide 8 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. We are very pleased with the progress we are making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we have delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We have again grown both our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS in Q2 2023 year-over-year, despite our transition towards a recurring revenue model, an uneven spending environment and FX rates remaining a significant headwind that impacted revenue growth by 480 basis points in Q2 2023. Slide 9 illustrates the progress we have made in our gross margin structure. Our Q2 2023 non-GAAP gross margin is up 200 basis points year-over-year. Our growing gross profit and margin are a testament to the success of the strategic pivot of our portfolio and the pricing actions we have taken. With 56% year-over-year growth in constant currency, our Intelligent Edge business was a standout and is now representing 19% of total sales in Q2 2023, up 580 basis points from a year ago. Slide 10 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin progress, which reached 11.5% in Q2 2023. This is up 220 basis points year-over-year, and it also represents a high watermark for non-GAAP operating profit margin for a Q2 in any year. Again, our portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies, and productivity focus are the primary drivers of our operating margin expansion. The Intelligent Edge business not only represented 19% of revenue in the quarter but did so with a record 26.9% operating margin. Turning to the next slide. As you know, we have chosen to exercise our put options on our shares in H3C. We are pleased to have announced earlier that we and our partner, Unisplendour, have come to an agreement and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% stake in H3C at USD 3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to complete certain conditions necessary for closing. We anticipate that the process to close will require a further 6 to 12 months to complete. However, this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement. We intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined return-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns, and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating we have outlined in the past. As part of this framework, we may consider a range of allocation activities, including but not limited to, both organic and strategic investments, return of capital to shareholders, repayment and/or redemption of outstanding debt and general corporate purposes. We have also negotiated the terms of a new go-forward strategic sale agreement to be entered into with H3C that covers the commercial sales, service, and reseller arrangements between the companies. We're firmly committed to serving our customers and to continuing to do business in China through both direct sales and our partner, H3C. Finally, as you see on this slide, we are continuing to benefit from H3C dividends in fiscal year 2023 and we'll provide a more detailed update at SAM in October 2023 as to our go-forward expectations in this area. In Q2 2023, we are pleased to have generated a positive $889 million in cash flow from operations and $288 million in free cash flow. Our free cash flow improved by $1.6 billion sequentially from a seasonally low Q1 2023 and was also nearly $500 million above our Q2 2022 free cash flow. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of fiscal year 2023 and reiterate our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Net income was the primary driver of our positive free cash flow. Working capital continued to be a use of cash in the quarter. The timing of receipts and payments plus continuing inventory investments have lifted our cash conversion cycle to a positive 24 days in Q2 2023. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle. Also, please remember we have made significant CapEx investments in HPFS volumes to drive future revenue growth in subsequent quarters. Now, let's turn to our outlook on Slide 13. As we have mentioned, demand for our products and services was more uneven in Q2 2023 across our business than it was in Q1 2023. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in other end markets such as Edge and HPC & AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive market share gains in key markets. We're also entering Q3 2023 still carrying a substantial order book relative to pre-pandemic levels. Let me reiterate that our guidance incorporates our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, inflationary pressure, and FX risk, which represented a 480 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q2 2023. I would like to remind you that approximately 50% of our revenue is generated in foreign currencies. We had indicated at our last earnings announcement that our financial performance in fiscal year 2023 is likely to be more weighted to the first half of the year than is typical. We continue to view that as the proper lens for fiscal year 2023. For Q3 2023, we expect revenues in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion. At the midpoint of the range, this represents revenues that are stable year-over-year and most importantly, flat sequentially in reported dollars. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.34 to $0.38 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.44 to $0.48. This outlook assumes the current levels of demand we have been experiencing remain relatively unchanged, that we continue to make progress on the delivery of our order book and no further deterioration from FX rates. Given the weakness in Compute demand, we are adjusting our previously communicated fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5% to 7% revenue growth to 4% to 6% in constant currency and expect FX to be a 250 basis point to 300 basis point revenue headwind. In parallel, we also expect our margin strength from portfolio mix shift to deliver non-GAAP operating profit growth of 6% to 7%, which is up from our prior 5% to 6% view. We are lifting our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $1.40 to $1.48 to a new range of $1.42 to $1.50 and raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from $2.02 to $2.10 to a new range of $2.06 to $2.14. We reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. For I&E, we have benefited in the first half 2023 from FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of this plus other anticipated benefits in the second half of 2023 now leads us to expect to why I need to be neutral on a full year basis versus our prior expectation of a $20 million to $40 million expense. In terms of capital returns, we expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. And we are maintaining our dividend and expect to repurchase at least $500 million worth of shares in fiscal year 2023. So to conclude, we see the uneven end market demand in FY 2023 as an opportunity for HPE to accelerate our portfolio pivot to faster growth, higher-margin recurring revenues. Antonio and I look forward to continuing our execution momentum through fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Now with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator :  And our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Antonio, can you dig a bit more into the significant outperformance you continue to see in Intelligent Edge? You're gaining share. The market remains strong. I know there's some backlog but it seems as if end demand is also remaining pretty solid. So, as you look at this business, how should we think about seasonality over the coming quarters because it's been so strong in the first half? How do you think about a more normalized growth rate in the business? And just any more color you can give because it has been such a strong performer. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Shannon. We are incredibly pleased about the performance of Intelligent Edge. If you recall, this has been a story in the making since the acquisition of Aruba in 2015, which I completed. And then in 2018, I committed to invest $4 billion over the next four years. And the result of this growth is a combination of many things : number one, a very differentiated portfolio, which is cloud driven; a lot of what we do is SaaS subscription, which drives a lot of infrastructure in the campus and branch, but now more and more at the edge of the data center. Second is the fact that our team has executed extremely well in targeting growth areas in the market by customer segment and verticals and used cases. And then after that, I will say, the cloud AI experience that we built in the portfolio with the simplicity of use is one of the reasons why customers prefer the HPE Intelligent Edge now delivered to HPE GreenLake offering. And over time, we have added more and more functionality, both organic and inorganically.  I think organically, the AIOps is a point of differentiation for us. We talk about AI these days, but we embedded AI in our HPE Aruba Central, now part of the GreenLake several years ago. We added, obviously, the SD-WAN component of our portfolio through the acquisition of Silver Peak. And now as Tarek said, we have closed the Axis Security. And think about it this way, for every $1 of SD-WAN, it should be $1 of SASE attached to it. That's why it was fundamental for us to bolster that type of capability. And then we are very bullish about the opportunity to provide private 5G as an extension of the connectivity layer with Wi-Fi, LAN, and SD-WAN. And then over time, we're going to continue to grow our data center footprint because of the organic investments we've made over a number of years, which actually, the differentiation comes from the silicon side and, as well as from the software side. 80% plus of our portfolio in the campus and branch has our own silicon. We use our own chipsets. And obviously, the software we deliver to ArubaOS-CX, is programmable to the silicon. So those are the reasons. I think the use cases continue to be very evident in hospitality. Obviously, as the services sector continue to do well, customers want a connected experience. We see that in health care, I see that as a part of my engagement in the health care, since I'm a director in an insurance company. We see that in manufacturing through automation and robotics. If you're not connected, obviously, you can't deliver any of that. But in the end, it's all about the digitization of enterprise and the first step to digitize in a data-first approach is the connectivity. So that's why we are very bullish about this. I think the business will continue to grow double-digits. That's why we laid out a few quarters back the Rule of 40 whatever is the mix of growth and profit. But so far, we have blown through the Rule of 40. If you add 56 and the 27, that's pretty much a Rule of 80-plus. And so that obviously is not sustainable, but we're gaining share and that's what really matters. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. Kirt Karros : Thank you Shannon. We\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe I can ask you on the AI pipeline that you discussed a few times on the call. How are you thinking about the land and expand opportunities as you sort of engage with these customers? I know you referenced a $800 million pipeline that you booked recently. And any insights into how competitive are these deals versus some of your sort of traditional supercomputer wins that you have, sort of completed for wins around? And just finally a quick follow-up, Slingshot and interconnect technology, how do you see that sort of evolving as becoming maybe a secondary, sort of source to NVIDIA in sort of the interconnect technology? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thank you. Obviously, what have been experienced in AI is simply amazing, breathtaking in some cases. I consider AI a massive inflection point, no different than Web 1.0 or mobile in different decades. But obviously, the potential to disrupt every industry, to advance many of the challenges we all face every day through data insights, it's just astonishing. And HPE has a unique opportunity in that market because ultimately, you need a what I call a hybrid AI strategy. You need strong inference at the edge. And that really comped by being able to connect and process data, whatever is created with very efficient and low carbon footprint, meaning sustainable solutions with lower power consumption. And then on the other side, you need a training environment where you take some part of the data, where you can train for different needs, different models for different type of used cases. And HPE has a unique portfolio from the inference side all the way to the training side. So, our HPE ProLiant has already some very powerful cost-efficient solutions at the inference. The amount of computational power, now we can put in one of these, what I call,  (ph) servers. It's simply amazing. And there are different types of configurations that we need to go through to accelerate the GPUs and the like and sometimes, CPUs, by the way. And on the other side, obviously on the training side, you need a scale type of models with very specialized stacks, and that's where HPE, through organic and inorganic acquisition, really excel because delivering this large amount of GPUs as a coherent system requires enormous expertise. And that's where HPE has unique differentiation in delivering AI at scale through supercomputing. Think about the old tech become the new tech in many ways. Second is unique IP and you named HPE Slingshot. HPE Slingshot is the true Ethernet fabric that's very efficient from both cost and power consumption to chain up to, in this case, like Aurora, 60,000 GPUs. And by the way, it's open because we can support any type of GPUs. Obviously, NVIDIA right now is a hot commodity, but think about Frontier, it was all AMD. And in the case of Aurora, it's all Intel. And we are building a lot of NVIDIA systems in partnership with NVIDIA. So, we can support that in an open environment. The other piece of this is the fact that HP has unique software. In order to present the system in a coherent way, you need software to manage contention of resources because the most important metric for developers is the starting and the completion of the model. And many developers we have been working with, not the traditional run type, but people are developing these large language models are telling us, \u2018sometimes, we try systems in an open cloud environment, it doesn't start for us. Sometimes we can't complete the model.\u2019 Is that's the unique expertise that we bring, because we now have to do that at scale. And then last, but not least, it's very important. Our aspiration is not just AI in the system infrastructure level. We already have, through the acquisition of HPE Cray today, a lot of software that actually provides the packages to train these models. And then in addition to the acquisition of Pachyderm and Determined AI, where we focus on the simplicity to prepare the data, to automate the data pipeline and eventually to train that data. And I think you will hear more about this in a couple of weeks when we go to HPE Discovery in Las Vegas. So, I would recommend you follow us because you will see some breakthrough announcements in the way we provide this AI solution from edge or inference all the way to the training model in a way that every type of customer can get access to our HPE GreenLake platform. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Kirt Karros : Thank you, Samik. We\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : The next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just get a better understanding about how you're thinking about the server cycle. And what I'm pondering here is, some of the third-party market researchers are predicting a rebound in server sales in calendar 2024, particularly coming from enterprise and telco operators. And that's been, I think, strong verticals for you. How are you thinking about how this cycle that you're \u2013 you highlighted the demand absorption that's occurring now, how do you see this playing out over multiple quarters? Antonio Neri : Well, Simon, we will be there. I mean, obviously, we have a large footprint. We participate in many of the verticals you described. In the short-term, obviously, we see a significant challenge in Financial Services. Tarek talked about that, called it the crisis of the Financial Services where the large deals that normally happen are now elongated or waiting to get longer approvals and the like. But there is also a lot of digestion and deflationary that's taking place on the commodity space as well, but there is no supply chain challenges. So, maybe just in time, orders works fine because now we can deliver servers in what I call pre-pandemic SLAs, right? So, that's a positive news. Now, it's hard to predict, to be honest with you. We commented that Europe and Asia and mid-market, things seems to be holding up. I agree with you the telco should be a growing opportunity. And listen, we have a very optimized compute platform for virtualization and round deployments. We have very strong partnerships with the equipment providers. We have a platform called HPE ProLiant 110 that's really very specialized for the virtualization of the brand. And as 5G deployments take hold, we expect to capture a size of that. But right now, it's a little bit blurry, and that's why with Tarek, we felt prudent and pragmatic, in many ways, to readjust that guidance for the short term. Ultimately, I think, I believe long term, there is a growth opportunity driven by the growth of data we see in the market. That data needs to be processed. The world is hybrid, so the balance between the public cloud and on-prem of colocations and now the edge continues to be there. I think form factors are evolving at the same time. But I think it comes down to the unit growth and the unit growth of what average unit price. These systems are becoming well more dense and more intelligent in any way. But at the same time, think about units and then attach rates and then what happened with the cost of commodity. So, there will be unit growth. I think there will be segments that will drive unit growth, but we have to see a little bit more before we can call that growth at this point in time. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Kirt Karros : Thank you, Simon. We\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : The next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the Intelligent Edge discussion, if I may. And I think your growth and margin are both obviously very impressive here. I think the growth rate is higher than what Arista is doing. So, maybe just spend a little bit of time on you. How much of this growth is really end demand-driven versus perhaps backlog liquidation-driven? Just anything on the backlog and what's happening over there would be helpful? And then I guess, Antonio, as you think about Intelligent Edge, your stock price clearly is not reflecting all the value that this segment is creating for your customers. So, I'm wondering, have you looked at a thought about different ways to unlock the potential value over time? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you for the question. I hope you will be writing about this because to your point, right, we are not getting credit for the stellar performance. And honestly, a story in the making for a number of quarters, right? So, this was the 11th consecutive quarters of growth for that business, which is very impressive in my mind. And I think Tarek had a little bit of challenge saying 1,400 basis points. I mean, normally, 100-plus or 200-plus, but 1,400, it was a little bit awkward to say it. And I think it's because A, we have that unique differentiation and the software that makes the portfolio so special in many ways, and that's what customers are attracted to. Now, as I think about what is driving, I think it's basically demand rolling through that very large order book. And as I said in my remarks, the order book for both the Intelligent Edge and AI remains very, very large, and that demand improved sequentially, as Tarek said. And so, we keep trying to work that order book, but we keep feeding our order book with sequential growth in that demand. We don't believe the demand is poised to go down significantly from here. In fact, we believe it's going to be somewhat steady. But that's why we need to keep innovating and keep adding functionalities and capability to that portfolio. As Tarek said, 19%, almost of the revenue now is coming from this portfolio. And this portfolio enable us to build scale, also and allows us to build the as-a-service model because a lot of what we have done with GreenLake came from the extraction of the cloud coming from this business that we expanded in the rest of the portfolio in hybrid cloud and AI. So, it's a very important critical business. I think the market is starting to see a sizing increase before they give us credit, but I think now everybody has to take notice of that. Tarek Robbiati : And Amit, if I can add to what Antonio said. I mean, this market is healthy, and it will continue to grow in the upper single digits for several years to come. We're very comfortable with this. We're also investing in adjacent TAMs. Antonio spoke about SASE, private 5G, but also data center networking, for us is a massive opportunity that we're going after. We're generating already a lot of revenues in there. Aruba today represented 19% of total revenues in Q2. If you really look at where we were at the end of fiscal year 2022, to put things in perspective, we were only at 13% of total revenues. So, we believe we now will be stably in the high teens as a percentage of revenues for the whole of the company. And then I'll let you do the math with regards to how much Aruba will represent as a percentage of total operating profit of the company.  So, Aruba is absolutely core. And you know that when we pass the 15% mark of total revenue, the stock market should take notice about that. And by way of comparison, if you compare Aruba in size to its next competitor, Juniper, it has roughly the same revenue at the end of the second quarter, but Juniper has 14% operating profit margin and Aruba is at 26.9%. That speaks volumes about the performance of Aruba. Antonio Neri : And I would say, you asked a question, how you consider unlocking the value? I mean, as you can expect, I mean, we really review with our Board strategy to maximize value for our shareholder. But we believe the edge is critical to our strategy because it's aligned to the customer need. You need the connectivity to drive the digital transformation. Without that is incomplete. At the same time, I know I talked about the leverage of the edge portfolio and the cloud for the rest of the company. And also, let's remind ourselves, we have cross-selling opportunities because once we land the customer on HPE GreenLake, whether it's through the edge or through the hybrid cloud and now through the AI as we go forward, you will see the opportunity to cross-sell, which benefit Aruba and the Intelligent Edge as a whole and the rest of the company as well. Kirt Karros : Thank you, Amit. We\u2019ll take our next question please. Operator : The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe share some color on your comments regarding deal velocity slowdown both in Compute and Storage, and you noted manufacturing and financial services verticals, in particular for Compute. Can you share some color on how linearity was in the quarter? And are you baking in an increased deceleration in other verticals as you look at your back half of the year? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Wamsi. I think Tarek mentioned that we assume in our guidance current level of demand and no further deterioration. Demand on Compute was slightly down from the previous quarter, compared to everything else that was up sequentially. And so from our vantage point, we believe we have covered this in the guidance. I think from the deterioration, I think it was clear when the financial crisis started sometime in March. We saw a deceleration and that was very evident in the financial sector, right, so the financial vertical, I will say. But that said, it is the most uneven parts of the portfolio, as we commented. I think it's driven by the digestion of our customers' order last year. The fact that today, they are maybe prioritizing investments in the edge or prioritizing investment in AI, which clearly we are a benefactor of it from that perspective. I think customers are looking for resilience as well, considering everything that's happening around the globe. And then also understanding what's happening with the cost of the commodities as we go to this transition. And ultimately, at some point, right, we see what the consumer market is going to do because the consumer is a driver of data as well. And so, we need to understand those trends. But I will say from that vantage point, I think clearly the Compute market as a whole, and this is important we segment this because sometimes people refer to Compute as servers. We don't refer that as servers. We refer that as a specific general purpose compute. The servers include, obviously, high-performance computing and other form factors. But in that space, clearly, is the most uneven at this time. Kirt Karros : Thank you, Wamsi. And operator, we have time for one more question, please. Operator : Our final question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you can just help triangulate some of the numbers around backlog that were highlighted on the call. So, I think backlog exiting last quarter was 2x normal. Exiting this quarter was 1.5x normal so it came down quite a bit, but you added $800 million in orders in the Intelligent Edge business. So that would suggest there was like really dramatic drawdown, like $1 billion-plus of backlog, in other businesses. So is that the right way to think about it or am I triangulating it incorrectly? And also how do \u2013 you keep saying that demand improved this quarter versus last quarter, but revenue was down and you drew down a lot of backlog. So, I'm also just trying to reconcile that. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. So, a couple of things I'll correct. So, last quarter, right, we exited with an order book that was 2x historical levels, and we refer to historical levels to pre-pandemic, Toni. And then this quarter, we're exiting 1.5x. What is different is that the mix of that order book is different, right? Because obviously, the growth we have in Intelligent Edge and AI is substantial, obviously. But the 800 million, I want to clarify that for you, Toni. The 800 million was just in the AI space. And every segment grew sequentially orders, except Compute, which was very  (ph) single-digits demand decline. And so clearly, when you want to isolate, it's Compute, it's Compute particularly in North America, it's Compute particularly in these two segments we described, financial services and manufacturing. But the mix of the order book has shifted because now the larger of the book is actually in the Intelligent Edge and it is in AI. And the 800 million I described earlier are all 100% orders that we got in the AI space because we saw a significant uptick, and that came from Fortune 500 companies, some of these digital-native large language models companies and a large cloud provider. But ultimately, that's what's happening. And the Compute \u2013 that's why we are readjusting that guidance on revenue because of the unevenness in Compute. But overall, we are, as a total company, 1.5x where normally we should be. Toni Sacconaghi : Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Well, thank you for all your comments, and we appreciate you attending today the call. I mean, I will leave with a simple message, right. So, I think overall, HPE had a very solid quarter. Obviously, we were not at the total revenue consensus as people put out there. But the fact of the matter, we grew revenues. We significantly grew our recurring revenues, and we had an exceptional profitability for the quarter. And this was driven by our pivot, and you can see the pivot and the meaningful impact that Intelligent Edge and AI is having to our business. We didn't spoke a lot about Storage, but Storage grew 2%. And at the same time, the Alletra platform, which is a software-defined platform, grew in excess of 100% and a big portion of that revenue is actually deferred. So, I think in the short-term, we're going to navigate this uneven demand in Compute, but we are very pleased about the momentum we have in hybrid cloud with GreenLake, AI and which is a massive, massive opportunity for the company with a unique differentiation and obviously, the Intelligent Edge, which is delivering a standout performance this quarter after quarter after quarter. So, with that, I hope to see you at HPE Discovery in Vegas in three weeks because we have some amazing announcements that we want to share with you that will continue to drive momentum in our business. So, thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation.",

Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. HPE delivered another solid quarter. We again increased our revenue, gross margin and earnings per share year-over-year and delivered strong free cash flow. Our results are being driven by our intentional ongoing mix shift to higher growth, higher margin parts of our portfolio that are critical priorities to customers. Our success in shifting the portfolio delivered a 120 basis points year-over-year non-GAAP gross margin expansion, driven by exceptional performance in areas like the Intelligent Edge, where revenue has set its fifth consecutive record quarter, and HPE GreenLake, which continue to accelerate our strategic pivot, generating higher recurring revenue and gross profit across our four product segments, driven by the increased mix of high margin software and services. In Q3, our Intelligent Edge business contributed 20% of our total company revenue. It is now the largest source of HPE's operating profit at 49% of our total segment operating profit. Our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform is accelerating our other service pivots, delivering an annualized revenue run rate, or ARR, of $1.3 billion, a 48% increase year-over-year. Our strategic shift towards edge, hybrid cloud and AI delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform is working, and we are delivering on our financial commitments. Because of our momentum and strong execution throughout this fiscal year, and once again, we are raising our full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. GAAP for full year diluted net earnings per share guidance will remain unchanged. For non-GAAP, diluted net earnings per share we are increasing to $2.30 at the midpoint, while maintaining both our full year constant currency revenue growth guidance of 4% to 6% and full year free cash flow guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. We will provide more details later in our call today, including on a GAAP basis. Our view of the macro environment remains unchanged from recent months. Customers continue to prioritize their data-first digital transformation, despite some reservations about the macroeconomic environment for the future. While the broader IT market is still pressured, demand for our products and services grew sequentially in the third quarter across all key segments of our business, driven by high-growth areas like AI and HPE GreenLake. We continue to see strong interest in our AI and supercomputing offerings from enterprise customers who are incorporating artificial intelligence into their businesses. This is translating into significantly higher demand for our HPC & AI business segment as customers discover HPE's unique capabilities to power unprecedented level of performance for AI at scale, including using our market-leading supercomputers built with sustainability in mind to train and tune their AI models. Total HPE revenue during the third quarter increased 3.5% year-over-year to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%, very close to the record level we achieved in the second quarter. Higher profitability in the third quarter compared to last year also corresponded to an increase in non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, which was $0.49, up 2% year-over-year. And we generated $955 million in free cash flow, an increase of nearly $370 million. The HPE GreenLake cloud platform is a key driver of financial performance, with our hybrid cloud offerings through the platform continue to attract new customers and compel existing customers to expand their contracts. HPE GreenLake orders rose 122% year-over-year, resulting in a nearly $1.5 billion increase in our as-a-service total contract value since last quarter. Our cumulative booked total contract value now stands at just under $12 billion. The scale and the strength of HPE GreenLake is evident; it supports 27,000 unique customer logos and 3.4 million connected devices, and more than 1,100 partners sell HPE GreenLake, one of the largest partner ecosystems selling as-a-service offerings in the industry. As we grow our ARR, we are also increasing the share of high-margin software and services. Software and services increased 2 percentage points sequentially to 68% of the total ARR mix, compared to 66% in the second quarter, with ongoing contributions from SaaS offerings tied to our HPE Ezmeral Software, storage and HPE Aruba Networking, our operational Services and OpsRamp, our recent acquisition. We are well-positioned to continue to grow the software and services mix within our ARR. For example, we saw a double-digit increase in demand with HPE operational services this quarter, which will contribute to future recurring revenues. The impressive gross margin in our as-a-service recurring revenues helped lift our already-strong overall company gross margin this quarter. These results demonstrate the relevance of our differentiated HPE GreenLake value proposition of providing one unified hybrid cloud experience to empower customers to access, analyze and extract value from their data, no matter where it lies, at the edge, in the colos or data center and in the public cloud. Now I would like to highlight a few important takeaways in our business segment results. First, as I said earlier, HPE's performance in the Intelligent Edge segment was particularly noteworthy in the quarter. Intelligent Edge revenue increased 53% year-over-year and operating profit more than doubled in another exceptional quarter for this business segment. I'm particularly pleased that our Intelligent Edge SaaS revenues continued to climb double-digits. We are gaining share, benefiting from improved availability of supply, high shipment volume and a strong response to our SaaS edge offerings in terms of both demand and revenue. Momentum in Intelligent Edge was consistent around the globe, with revenue increasing by double-digits in all regions in the third quarter. One example is the University of Maryland, which wanted a stronger cloud-based policy-driven wired and wireless network that could provide improved automation, better device visibility and easier and more secure access for students, faculty and staff as they are returning to campus. The University selected HPE Aruba Networking for a campus-wide refresh to enhance the flexibility, visibility and security of its network through HPE Aruba ClearPass, our SaaS platform to onboard new devices, grant varying access levels and keep network secure. The HPC & AI business segment saw a way for demand acceleration in the quarter, as we converted on AI deal opportunities and shipped orders that leverage our unique end-to-end AI value proposition, from training to tuning to inference. As a result, we exited the quarter with the largest HPC & AI order book we have ever had. Our AI momentum also helped grow our total HPE order book, which is now at more than 2 times pre-pandemic levels, driven by exceptional customer demand for our AI solutions and sequential demand improvements across our four product segments. Only HPE can combine our unique AI software and slingshot networking fabric. HPE services offerings and market-leading sustainable supercomputers. Our open ecosystem of AI suppliers is also an advantage for customers, who are turning to us for a full-spectrum of enterprise AI workloads and use cases, spanning large-scale model development, training, tune and inferencing. Through the UK's GW4 Alliance of four UK research universities, HPE won a contract from the UK Research and Innovation to develop Isambard 3, a supercomputer that leverages the latest HPE Cray XD supercomputers, HPE Slingshot Interconnect and NVIDIA Grace CPU -- GPU Superchip. The system will provide researchers engineers and data scientists purpose-built capabilities to train AI models and accelerate research in clean energy, drug discovery, medical diagnosis and astrophysics. In addition, we were selected by Tokyo Institute of Technology Global Scientific Information and Computing Center to build its next-generation supercomputer, which is called TSUBAME 4.0, which includes AMD CPUs and NVIDIA's GPUs to accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery in medicine, material science and climate research. Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a leading public tech-bio company that uses advancement in AI to accelerate and industrialize the discovery of new drugs. Recursion turned to HPE's AI software to scale its foundation model efforts, significantly speed up training across its more than 25 petabytes of biological and chemical data and improve team collaboration. We are seeing AI projects generate exciting results on our supercomputers. For example, the LUMI supercomputer built by HPE with AMD CPUs and GPUs is the fastest system in Europe and the third fastest in the world. It has enabled generative AI projects, such as creating the world's largest finished language model, and it has helped researchers apply AI for early detection of diagnosis of breast and prostate cancers. We continue to make progress in ushering in the area of exascale supercomputing, which enables unprecedented scale and performance for larger AI models, such as generative AI. This quarter, HPE in collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory started to build and test El Capitan, one of the largest upcoming exascale supercomputers. El Capitan, which uses AMD CPUs and GPUs is expected to reach two exaFLOPS of peak performance, will allow researchers to apply AI to advance U.S. national security and breakthroughs in medical and drug research initiatives. We are seeing demand improving in both our Storage and Compute segments. Storage demand was solid year-over-year with a cloud-native HPE Alletra portfolio recording triple-digit revenue growth. Storage SaaS revenue also increased double digits as we continue to intentionally drive more of HPE's Alletra own IP through HPE GreenLake. Compute performed well considering the sector ongoing cyclicality. We saw sequential unit demand increase in the quarter. One area where we anticipate demand picking up in the coming quarters is customers seeking a solution to run AI inference workloads. Our new HPE ProLiant Gen 11 servers optimized for AI workloads are well positioned for this growing customer need. During the third quarter, we started shipping these servers, which boosted AI inference performance by more than 5x over previous models. And just last week, we expanded our portfolio for enterprise tuning and inference solutions with NVIDIA and VMware to accelerate their customers' generative AI deployments. To round out our major segments, in HPE Financial Services, revenue climbed 7% year-over-year and financing volume ticked up 6%. HPE Financial Services continues to be strategically important as we continue to ramp up our as-a-service volumes through HPE GreenLake. We continue to strengthen our innovation from edge to cloud, position HPE well for the future. In June, we hosted more than 10,000 customers and partners at our annual HPE Discovery event, where we unveiled exciting new edge, hybrid cloud and AI solutions to help customers achieve their business goals and gain competitive advantage. At HPE Discover, we announced we have entered the AI public cloud market with HPE GreenLake for large language models. Available at the end of this calendar year, the offering will enable a wide variety of enterprise customers to privately train and tune their data, using our industry-leading AI sustainable supercomputer infrastructure and software. We also extended our hybrid cloud leadership at HPE Discover with new HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud services, including our new SaaS-based IT Operations Management solution from our recent acquisition of OpsRamp. And to drive faster, easier and more sustainable ways to deploy our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud solutions outside of the data center, we expanded our partnership with colo market leader Equinix, which enable customers to go from [quarter] (ph) production in days by using our HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise stack. Two new HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise customers are global logistics solutions leader, Swisslog, and global media -- global company [Media House] (ph). Swisslog chose HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise to help accelerate their automation of its warehouse centers with a cutting-edge on-premises private cloud that could provide rapid, secure and controlled service delivery. Media House, which owns more than 30 different news brands in Europe, wanted a modern on-premise private cloud to accelerate its digital transformation and better leverage data to attract and retain subscribers with a more personalized customer experience. HPE GreenLake will help the company achieve operational agility, mitigate risk and address IT skills gap and advance its digital priorities. At HPE Discover, we expanded our HPE GreenLake private cloud portfolio with HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud Business Edition, a new offering that allows customers to spin a virtual machine across hybrid clouds on demand. This new offer is an extension of a hyperconverged portfolio with automation and hybrid cloud software built into the private cloud solution. Early in the quarter, we previewed a new sustainability dashboard on the HPE GreenLake platform alongside a comprehensive portfolio of sustainability services designed to help organizations reduce the carbon footprint associated with the hybrid IT estate. Customers understand that the hybrid IT estate can be one of their biggest sources of operational emissions and have made measuring and reducing their carbon footprint business imperative. Driving the steady drumbeat of innovation strengthened our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud value proposition for customers to extend our industry leadership, expand our total addressable market and position us well to accelerate the momentum across edge, hybrid cloud and AI in the future. We have been advancing our strategy for the last several years and even a very dynamic market environment, it is clear that our strategy, combined with strong execution and a terrific team set us apart. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the progress we have made to shift our portfolio to higher growth, higher margin areas that they are the most critical to customers as they continue to transform. Our pivot to software and services-rich businesses has led to new customer logos, greater recurring revenue, margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. This is why we are once again raising our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance. Despite a slowdown in some parts of the IT industry, our HPE team has executed our strategy, bringing differentiated innovation and a diverse portfolio to customers around the globe. This positions us to continue to win in the market and deliver for our shareholders. I'm very pleased to pursue these priorities more closely with Jeremy Cox, whom I appointed as our Interim Chief Financial Officer earlier this month. Jeremy is an experienced finance leader whose customer-centric approach, institutional knowledge and track record of operational excellence, sets him up well to serve in this role while we conduct an internal and external search for a permanent CFO. Jeremy will now discuss our quarter financial results in greater detail. So Jeremy, welcome. Over to you. Jeremy Cox : Thank you very much, Antonio. I'm honored to take on the responsibility of Interim CFO as we go through the process. I'll start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of FY 2023. Antonio discussed key highlights on Slide 4. Let me begin with Slide 5, financial highlights. We're actively diversifying our business mix towards our higher-growth, higher-margin portfolio of Intelligent Edge, HPC & AI and HPE GreenLake solutions. This pivot is clearly visible in the 120 basis-point year-over-year expansion of non-GAAP gross margins. We delivered a solid quarter within an IT market still under some pressure. Cycle times remain elongated and digestion of prior orders will continue to have some near-term impact. This has been particularly true in Compute and, to a lesser extent, in Storage. Despite these challenges, we delivered 3.5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency to $7 billion, which exceeded the midpoint of our Q3 revenue guidance. This figure included a modest amount of AI revenue. We do see several promising indicators that suggest stabilization. Antonio mentioned the sequential improvement in demand across our four product segments. We're starting to see indicators that our largest customers are returning to the market. Intelligent Edge continues to increase revenues rapidly, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis and robust AI demand is evident in our as-a-service orders. Our non-GAAP gross margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 35.9%. This is off just 30 basis points from our high watermark of 36.2% last quarter. Our margin structure reflects the pivot of our business mix to higher margin, software-intensive recurring revenue, such as Intelligent Edge. The edge mix was up 450 basis points year-over-year. Our Q3 '23 non-GAAP operating margin reached 10.3%, this is down 120 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, the driver was largely return of Compute operating margins to just below long-term target range of 11% to 13% after six consecutive quarters above the range. We expect the impact of Compute operating margin cyclicality on HPE's operating margins to decline over time, as our revenue mix shifts towards our higher-growth, higher-margin businesses. Our Intelligent Edge business reached a record-high 29.7% operating margin. We remain focused on productivity and continue to expect revenue growth to outpace OpEx growth over time. Our solid Q3 and margin -- revenue and margin performance led GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.35 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49, which was up $0.01 year-over-year despite Compute cyclicality. It was also $0.01 above the high end of our Q3 guidance range of $0.44 to $0.48. Our Q3 free cash flow was $955 million. We continue to return substantial capital to our shareholders, paying $154 million in dividends and repurchasing $187 million in stock this quarter. We have now returned $831 million in capital to shareholders this year. Moving to Slide 6. Our as-a-service revenue pivot continues to show strong momentum. ARR reached $1.3 billion in Q3 '23. The benefits of as-a-service deals we won in prior quarters are now appearing in our results, though, the large AI-as-a-service deals booked in Q3 have yet to reach revenues. Year-over-year ARR growth in constant currency has accelerated from 25% in Q4 '22 to 31% -- 38% and now 48% in Q3 '23. The 48% growth is above our long-term 35% to 45% target and should be viewed as an indicator of our long-term momentum rather than as a new growth trajectory. The fastest-growing components within ARR year-over-year are Storage and Edge. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin, recurring software and services revenue. Antonio mentioned that in Q3, our software and services mix rose to 68% and should continue to increase. While this mix has traditionally tilted to services, software is now half of the total. In the future, we expect software growth to exceed services growth and for as-a-service margins to rise over time. To Slide 7. Our Q3 as-a-service order growth was robust. We're pleased to have delivered 122% year-over-year order growth which has raised our cumulative as-a-service TCV to nearly $12 billion. The driving factor was AI demand. A significant percentage of our AI orders have come under the as-a-service model and the strength this quarter should also provide confidence in our long-term 35% to 45% ARR growth outlook. Order growth will fluctuate given the volatility of large as-a-service deals. Now let's turn to our segment highlights on the next slide. And remember, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenues 53% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, delivering record revenues for a fifth consecutive quarter. Customers are increasingly adopting our software-centric solutions such as Edge Connect SD-WAN software and our Aruba Central management platform. We've expanded the Axis Security and SASE funnel to 6 times since the acquisition. Our operating margin of 29.7% was up more than 1,300 basis points year-over-year and 280 basis points sequentially. We're benefiting from revenue scale and prior pricing actions, which are helping us build visibility into the durability of our mid-20% margin target over time. While we're making progress on our order book, we expect to carry an above-normal order book into FY '24. In HPC & AI, revenue grew 3% year-over-year. Customer discussions on large language models and generative AI that began in Q1 turned to wins in Q2 and are now showing up as as-a-service orders in Q3. AI, the predominant driver of our 122% year-over-year growth in as-a-service dollars has also driven sequential growth in our corporate total order book, which I'll discuss in a moment. We expect AI deals to provide gross margin rates above historical levels. We believe building and operating large AI models requires unique computational capabilities, including silicon and software that our HPE Cray supercomputers and HPC & AI solutions are extremely well positioned to enable. As for operating margin, our Q3 performance was just below breakeven. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key components and long lead times in this segment mean that operating margins in HPC & AI will continue to fluctuate. We'll discuss our outlook for revenue growth, investment and margin improvement at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Storage fell 2% year-over-year but rose 3% sequentially. HPE Alletra revenue grew triple digits in Q3 for the fifth consecutive quarter. It is now one of our higher revenue products and thus growth rates may normalize. This product is shifting our mix within Storage to higher-margin, software-intensive revenue and is a key driver of our ARR growth. We'll continue to invest in R&D and our owned IP products in this business unit, such as our new file-as-a-service and HPE Alletra MP offerings. Q3 '23 operating margin of 10.7% is down 360 basis points year-over-year as we transition to HPE Alletra. HP Alletra includes a meaningful component of ratable revenue, which pushes revenue recognition out into future periods. Compute revenue was down 10% year-over-year to $2.6 billion and down 5% sequentially. Deal elongation challenges we've discussed previously were most prevalent in the Compute business as some customers digest prior investments. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a significant driver. But, as previously noted, we did see sequential demand improvement. And after six quarters of above plan operating margins in Compute, this quarter's 10.9% was a shade below our long-term margin target of 11% to 13%. HPE Financial Services revenues rose 7% year-over-year and financing volume of $1.7 billion grew 6% in constant currency, driven by HPE GreenLake. Our operating margins were down 340 basis points year-over-year, reflecting rapid interest hikes and higher cost of funds that will gradually offset over time through pricing, as well as lower asset management margins as supply challenges ease. Time and time again, HPE FS has proven resilient in a downturn, thanks to the quality underwriting of our book of business. Throughout the pandemic, our annual loss ratio never exceeded 1%, and our Q3 loss ratio of 0.48% was even lower than it was in the full year 2019 pre-pandemic. Slide 9 highlights our revenue and non-GAAP diluted net EPS performance. The progress we're making against our edge-to-cloud strategy is evident in the financial results we delivered on both the top and bottom lines. We've held our revenue steady this quarter and expanded non-GAAP diluted net EPS year-over-year despite an uneven spending environment, our transition towards a recurring revenue model and FX rates remaining a significant headwind. FX was a 280 basis point headwind to revenue growth in Q3. On Slide 10, we've included a new depiction of our portfolio shift, which illustrates just how significant the Intelligent Edge business has become for HPE. Even three years ago, Intelligent Edge constituted just 10% of revenue, and this quarter, it represents 20%. Operating profit trajectory is even more dramatic. Edge contributed just over 10% of operating profit three years ago and is now 49% of total segment operating profit. We will offer our forward-looking view at our Security Analyst Meeting. Slide 11 illustrates the progress we've made on our gross margin structure. Our Q3 non-GAAP gross margin is up 120 basis points year-over-year despite FX headwinds. Our year-over-year non-GAAP gross profit and margin growth show the success of our strategic portfolio pivot and the pricing actions HPE has taken. Slide 12 illustrates our non-GAAP operating margin, which was 10.3% in Q3. This is down 20 basis points year-over-year, also inclusive of FX headwinds, and 120 basis points sequentially. While the primary driver of the sequential decline was the return of Compute operating margins to near our target range, we also made certain targeted investments in the quarter to further enable our pivot. Our deliberate portfolio mix shift, pricing strategies and productivity focus put us on track to increase operating margin in FY '23. On Slide 13, as previously announced, we exercised the put option on our shares in H3C and signed a put share purchase agreement that values our 49% H3C stake at US$3.5 billion. The next step in the process is to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and to conclude certain conditions necessary for closing. We expect to conclude this process in the first half of calendar year 2024; although this time line could be further extended pursuant to the terms of our agreement. We intend to update our plans for the use of proceeds once the transaction closes. You can assume that we will use the same disciplined returns-based framework for evaluating investments, capital returns and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating that we've outlined in the past. Finally, we continue to benefit from H3C dividends in FY '23. We'll offer an update on our go-forward expectations for H3C dividend at SAM in October. Now to Slide 14. We generated $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations and $955 million in free cash flow. Our Q3 free cash flow improved by approximately $670 million sequentially and nearly $370 million year-over-year. Similar to our Q4 '22 performance, we expect to generate significant free cash flow in the remainder of FY '23 and are reiterating our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion in free cash flow in FY '23. The timing of receipts and payments plus inventory investments have held cash conversion cycle steady sequentially at 23 days. We expect to exit the year with a neutral cash conversion cycle. Now let's turn to outlook on Slide 15. As we've mentioned, the broader IT market is still pressured. Macro uncertainty is affecting some of our end markets, yet customer investment is rising in others, such as Edge and HPC & AI. We believe our portfolio differentiation will continue to drive share gains in key markets. We are also entering Q4 with an order book that is more than 2 times pre-pandemic levels. Our order book has increased from more than 1.5 times pre-pandemic levels entering Q3, primarily on the strength of AI orders. The assumptions in our guidance, which incorporate our current thinking on the macroeconomic picture, demand, inflationary pressure, supply and FX rates remain relatively unchanged. We've indicated throughout the fiscal year that our financial performance is likely to be weighted to the first half of the year. We continue to view this as the proper framework for FY '23. For Q4, we expect revenues in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.5 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.40 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.48 and $0.52. We're reiterating our prior fiscal year 2023 guidance of 4% to 6% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect FX to be a 300 basis-point revenue headwind from our previously communicated 250 to 300 basis-point headwind. In parallel, we also reiterate our expectation that margin strength from our portfolio mix shift will deliver non-GAAP operating growth of 6% to 7%. We're reiterating our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of between $1.42 and $1.46 due to tax rate differences and additional amortization of intangibles from our recent acquisitions. We're raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance from between $2.06 to $2.14 to between $2.11 and $2.15. We reiterate our guidance for free cash flow of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. For OI&E, we benefited this year from higher interest income and FX hedging costs lower than we originally forecasted. The combination of these and other anticipated benefits in the second half of this fiscal year leads us to expect OI&E to be a positive $50 million to $70 million on a full year basis. We had previously expected OI&E to be neutral for the full year. In terms of capital returns, we are maintaining our dividend and expect to return approximately 60% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. So to conclude, the uneven end market demand thus far in FY '23 is an opportunity for HPE to showcase our differentiated portfolio led by HPE GreenLake Hybrid Cloud, Intelligent Edge and HPC & AI, and we'll continue to take the steps required to further accelerate the pivot of our product portfolio and our company towards faster growth, higher margin recurring revenues. We look forward to updating you with HPE's outlook beyond FY '23 at our Securities Analyst Meeting in October. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could put the AI wins in the same terms you did at the analyst section you had in June when you told us you had $1.6 billion in awards. That was a combination of CapEx and recurring deals that would be spread out over a number of years. So, what I'm looking for is an update on that and how much of the AI are you expecting in that fourth quarter? And sort of what's the timeframe for seeing the benefits? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thanks, Simon. Well, all those deals we talked through came through. They were booked and the pipeline continues to be super strong. In fact, I will say the pipeline we came in, we exit is pretty much the same. So that means throughout the quarter, we booked those deals and we exit pretty much with the same pipeline we came in. So clearly, the momentum in the business is significant. But as you can see, our progress is showing up in as-a-service, which you saw the 122% as-a-service order growth, which is very significant, and that fuels our order book to be now more than 2 time than pre-pandemic levels, and we exit the HPC & AI quarter with the largest ever order book we ever had. Now we start now shipping some of those orders, those wins, but it's long ways to go. And remember that there's two components related to that. Number one is availability supply, which obviously in the AI space is constrained. Number two is the fact that when you deploy these deals, you have to install it and then drive acceptances, which means elongated times for revenue recognition. And then maybe in a specific win or two, there are other conditions related to the contractual agreements. So the net of this is that what we discussed at the end of Q2 and then during the HPE Discover came all through and then what I'm really pleased of is the quality of the deals we are getting. And I just referenced a half a dozen or so in my opening remarks to give a sense of the type of customers we're winning to make sure you understand the proof points associated with that. And so, as we go forward, we expect this momentum to accelerate, but the revenue recognition will be different than the what I call the demand bookings in our systems because, obviously, that takes time. In any case, the other thing I will say is that one of the reasons why customers are coming to us is because we have a complete life cycle of solutions from training to tuning to inferencing. So, on training side, obviously, these are companies that develop their own language models, whether it's startups or large unique customers. On the tuning side, which I believe will be -- one of the biggest opportunity will be when customers use these foundational models that you can get in the market we're going to offer over time, five unique of them in our AI public cloud instance. So they can tune those models with their data in a private, secure, responsible way. And then number three, which I'm really excited because it would be an accelerator of both Compute and Edge, is going to be the AI inferencing. And so all those three will move concurrently. And so you have to look at this not just the next quarter, but on a mid- to long-term basis, call it, two, four and then eight quarters. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Simon. Gary, could we have the next question, please? Operator : The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the results. I guess I wanted to build on Simon's question a little bit. I think in the context of last quarter and what you had disclosed at the analyst event, you had also alluded to within that pipeline, large hyperscale cloud opportunities. I'm curious what are you seeing in that vertical? Should we expect that to further expand? Just kind of any context around the positioning within cloud where HPE Enterprise hasn't really historically had a material footprint. Why are you winning in that -- in those opportunities if they're expanding? Antonio Neri : Yes, Aaron. So one of the opportunities we won in Q3 was a large hyperscaler. We haven't even started building and shipping that. So that tells you the size of it. And we have further opportunities down as I look at '24. The reason why they come to us is, number one, it's because we have a unique amount of intellectual property. Think about it as an open ecosystem with our networking fabric, which obviously supports NVIDIA. We have a fantastic relationship with NVIDIA, but also supports other type of accelerators. And depending on the AI workload, it can be a mix and match. If you hear my comments, right, in some cases, we have NVIDIA GPUs with potentially AMD CPUs. In some cases, all NVIDIA, in some cases -- in the case, for example, of the Aurora system, the Argonne Laboratory is actually all Intel. So that provides flexibility for customers whether it's performance driven or supply driven over time. And the other one is because we have unique expertise in AI. Remember, we have been in AI for a decade. It's just we have done it for unique discrete customers. That we're building this system on a purpose base. But now this is why we entered the AI public cloud to democratize the AI for every enterprise -- and that's why we saw the growth in the HPE GreenLake as-a-service AI bookings, because they cannot build that themselves. And the other piece of this is the ability to consume this in a sustainable way. I think sustainability is becoming a key component because customers deploy AI want to make sure they control the carbon footprint with it. And then the data center services, which are essential to run this massive at-scale AI solutions. And then for the large language model companies, one of the things that attract them to us it's not just all of the things I just said, it is the fact that working with us, they can get access to our route to market, so they can reach enterprises in ways potentially they couldn't by themselves. So it's a combination of multiple things. That they are all coming our way, I will say. But ultimately, our strategy is a software-led strategy using our supercomputer as a cloud kind of experience and then wrapping around all the services and the software needed to provide that level of capability. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Aaron. Gary, could we have the next question, please? Operator : The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe taking a second on the Intelligent Edge business. Can you just kind of give a sense of what is the biggest forward driver that you're seeing? I think people understand kind of the catch-up spend and the backlog release that has been done, but just what you're kind of seeing in ongoing kind of orders today? And is that Wi-Fi 6? Is it still kind of return to work? Just what are the biggest drivers that you're seeing to kind of help continue the growth of that business? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you for the question. I'm incredibly proud of the work we have done in the Intelligent Edge business segment. This is the opportunity I highlighted in 2018, where I said we will invest over the next four years to build the right solutions that ultimately will allow customers to drive what I call a data-first digital transformation. So, it's a combination of things : number one, return to work, obviously, you need to have the right connectivity; number two, in order to process the data, you need to connect devices and things that are essential, right, in order to provide the right cloud experience on those types of workloads and applications. But our portfolio is unique because we provide edge to cloud networking capabilities. Our strength obviously has been always in the campus and branch. We see that to transition to Wi-Fi 6. In fact, we shipped more than $30 million ports so far with Wi-Fi 6. By number of access points and ports, we are one of the largest, if not the largest, I will say. And also now that drives the 26 million ports we drove in the switching side, which was the thesis when I acquired Aruba in 2015. Over time, we have made these all cloud native and we have added to it. And so, as we look forward, what I'm excited is that we are delivering more capabilities and expanding our time with the same experience. So, we added Software-Defined Wide Area Network. Three, four years ago was a niche market, now is a very large market more than $5 billion in the TAM, and that's why we did the acquisition of Silver Peak. Now that's integrating the same control plane with HPE GreenLake as a part of the Aruba experience. And now we just completed the acquisition of Axis Security. So it takes Axis Security and Silver Peak. Now we're going to offer the most comprehensive SSE framework at the edge. And then also we are integrating Athonet, which provide both core 5G software-defined solutions and private 5G at the edge. All of this comes under a cloud native model in a subscription based model, which will continue to fuel the growth as we think about '24 and '25. Bottom line, it is one of the most comprehensive portfolio out in the market and no surprise obviously with the growth we have, obviously, we are converting more of our order book. But we exited Q3 and we expect to exit Q4 with a significant elevated order book in -- as we enter '24. And you can see the results right now represent 20% of the company revenue and almost half of the company profit. And so, the mix shift had really worked for us in this particular part of the portfolio as it is now with GreenLake as well. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Meta. Gary? Operator : The next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. If you can -- storage was up sequentially, which was a positive and it seems like the HPE Alletra is getting traction. As you think about the fourth quarter -- the fiscal fourth quarter, if you can provide some guidelines on how you're thinking about your storage portfolio, both on the top-line as well as when you think margins kind of get back to, I think, the target margins, which are much higher than where they are right now? Thank you. Antonio Neri : So, let me start and I will pass it to Jeremy. The team and I drove an intentional strategy to pivot that portfolio, which was a conglomerate of different offerings that we built over 15 years or so to one consistent architecture that allows customers to consume data services, both primary and secondary in a cloud-native way and a subscription-based model. So, HPE Alletra is our primary storage that now covers pretty much all the price segments of the price bands, if you will, of the traditional storage from general purpose to business critical to mission-critical. And we address block and file. And in the future, we're also going to address the object piece. So as a customer, you can now subscribe to HPE GreenLake, deploy one consistent back-end infrastructure, whether it's in a colo, or the edge, or in your own data center and consume hybrid cloud data services. And you can put block type of solutions or file and then eventually object, which is a significant CapEx reduction for customers because they don't have to buy three different ways to deploy it. And an OpEx reduction because obviously, it's very efficient to manage in a cloud type of experience. And so, this business went from zero to in excess of $1 billion very, very quickly. And it's amazing that it's one of the fastest-growing products in our portfolio, growing triple digits. But what I'm really pleased is that it comes with a significant subscription, which is growing double digits. So maybe, Jeremy, you want to take the second part of the question, how we see this evolve, in particular from a margin perspective. Jeremy Cox : Sure. And that's where I'll pick up, Antonio, it was on Alletra. I think we've previously talked to you guys about how this product is really a combination now of a higher software component and that software component does have an element of taking what was prior product revenue and now deferring that onto the balance sheet, about 14% is deferred onto the balance sheet. And so, as we see that work off over time as that product is deployed out, we'll start seeing an inflection point, and that should positively impact revenue as we look forward, particularly into FY '24. And that also has an impact on the margin line, too, as that deferral is deferring software-based revenue that has a higher margin concentration to it. So we would expect to see our operating margins start to recover back to kind of historical levels as well as we look forward to '24. Antonio Neri : And as Jeremy said, right, so there is a specific component is ratable here. So, we are going through that transition. But for two consecutive quarters, we saw demand improving, Q1 to Q2 and Q2 to Q3, and that's very positive. And we expect that to show up as we go forward as we transition those orders into revenues. Jeff Kvaal : Asiya, thank you. Gary? Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess you mentioned a couple of times in your prepared remarks about the cyclicality in the Compute business, which is a headwind. Maybe if you can outline your thoughts on where we are in the cycle? Is there more downside to revenue and margins as we move into fiscal fourth quarter? Or -- you did reference a demand improvement. So I'm just sort of curious, does it imply fiscal 3Q is sort of the near-term trough here in the business. And more broadly, if I can ask like questions that investors are asking us today is how much of the demand improvement that you're seeing going into fiscal '24 helps you offset the tailwind that you have this year from backlog and still enable you to grow in fiscal '24? If you can share any early thoughts on that? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure. So first of all, I think it's important to recognize that the traditional general-purpose Compute business goes through these cycles, right? Last year, we obviously have got a significant demand uptick because of the supply chain challenges. Customers are absorbing that, in some cases, we still need to deploy some of those products and the like. But we saw signs of stabilization and we saw demand improvement at the unit level, which is super, super important because demand in the unit level also drives attach. And as I referenced in my remarks, that unit demand together with the storage demand and obviously, the acceleration we saw in HPE GreenLake drove double-digit growth in operational services, which obviously is important as we think about ratable revenue and profit as we look into the future. Now we have this unique expectation of the company because in the past, we wanted to give you visibility of what is general-purpose compute and what is HPC and supercomputers. But when you combine the two is what I refer to the server category. Because in the end, there is a server component associated with that. And there is different IP you bundle depending it's a general purpose or a supercomputer. And the combination of general-purpose compute, as you refer, and HPC and supercomputers demand clearly improved very nicely quarter-over-quarter. I think as I think about 2024 as a server category, I think you're going to see the continued improvement in demand on HPC & AI. I think the AI inference related to Compute will be announced to the rate for Compute. And then we have to see the evolution of price in the commodity space, which you will expect some time in '24. That curve will end up again because as demand stabilize and improves, cost of commodity will start going up. And remember, we also have a tradition in the making from what I call Gen 10 and Gen 10.5 to Gen 11. And Gen 11 also comes with a higher, we call it, product intensity. So as more options and the options come with larger memory and larger type of storage and obviously more GPU embedded in the traditional compute will drive, over time, AUPs up. I don't know if Jeremy, do you have anything to add. Jeremy Cox : Maybe I'll pick up on the margin side of it, Antonio. Obviously, in these cycle times, we've -- I think we've proven that in down cycles where commodities are declining, causing declines in AUP. We've been able to hold pricing to drive margin. And then as it inflects back and turns back up, we've been able to be leading market leaders on pricing to make sure that we're catching it appropriately on that. So our expectation is as that changes throughout this process, on top of the point that Antonio made about Gen 11 really driving an AUP premium for us, which can also be an impact. We still expect that 11% to 13% operating profit, structural range to be reflective of what our longer-term expectations are. Antonio Neri : But let me reinforce one important point because if you go back two years or three years, whatever was the cyclicality at the time, we will have a different dynamic in our total company revenue and profit. I want to reemphasize that because of our mix shift to edge, hybrid cloud and now AI as we go forward, which always expect margins to improve. The strong performance we had in that mix shift more than offsets the cyclicality we saw in Compute, which is very evident in our Q3 results because our margins improved again, 120 basis points. If you go back two years ago, our margins at the company level were in the 33%-s, in 2022, we're in the 34%-s, and in 2023, we are in the high 35%-s. And so that tells you that structurally, our business composition is shifting, and we intend to continue to drive that mix shift. And that's why software and services with Intelligent Edge and hybrid cloud and now AI with our software-led strategy, we'll continue to sustain that. And we will be able to manage the cyclical Compute much, much better. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you, Samik. Gary, could we make this our last question, please? Operator : And our final question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Antonio, you're exiting this year with a high single-digit decline in revenues and Edge clearly is doing extremely well and some benefit from backlog. How confident are you that HPE can grow revenues in fiscal '24, given the current exit trajectory of the business? You also noted some stabilization. So curious to get just some high-level thoughts, not explicit guidance, maybe, but just some directional commentary on how you could see that playing out. Antonio Neri : I think your comment is related to Q4, right? So obviously, we are going to lap a very high quarter because last year in Q4, we were able to convert more of that order book related to the fact that supply started improving in Q4, and you saw that in Q1. So to me, it's just a lapping of the numbers. But that said, we're going to talk to this at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect revenue to continue to improve in fiscal year '24. We're going to tell you exactly what that will look like. But I will say that while revenue will improve year-over-year, and remember, in Q1, we're also going to have a big lap because Q1 revenue was $7.8 billion, the fact of the matter on a yearly basis, right, this year, we are growing 4% to 6%. And Jeremy talked about the headwind we saw in the FX, which is now 300 basis points. So, we are growing faster than what we guided you at the beginning of the year, which was 2% to 4%. We are now growing 4% to 6%. And we expect our revenue to continue to improve because of these momentum we have in the businesses, but we'll guide you a specific percentage at the Security Analyst Meeting. But the other important part is that the mix of our revenue is changing, and the gross margin mix is changing, and also the way we generate free cash flow is changing. And so, more to come when we talk at the Security Analyst Meeting, okay? I know that, unfortunately, you have to cover a lot of companies today, and I understand HP Inc. is about to start the call. I hope you can see from this quarter results how our strategy is working. We are delivering on our commitments. We always do what we say. And we are shifting successfully our portfolio. And so, despite some aspects of the market, being a little bit more challenged than others, we continue to grow revenue, we continue to expand margins, and we'll continue to improve our net earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis. So, I'm looking forward to see you at the Security Analyst Meeting in October. We're going to have it in New York, so it's a little bit more accessible. So, I hope to see you soon. And if you have any questions, we'll follow up with you offline. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for attending.

Antonio Neri : Thanks, Jeff and good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In fiscal year\u2026 Operator : Pardon me, this is the conference operator. The speaker's line has appears to have dropped. Please remain on the line while we rejoin them. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Eddie, can you hear us? Operator : Yes sir, we can hear you now. Thank you. Antonio Neri : All right, thank you. Well thanks Jeff and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In fiscal year 2023, HPE delivered record performance against non-GAAP financial metrics by capitalizing on strong momentum across our portfolio. Our steady execution has resulted in higher revenue, further gross margin expansion, larger operating profit, and record-breaking non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Our growth engines in Intelligent Edge and HPC and AI, as well as our HPE GreenLake platform, are helping to accelerate our revenue and profit diversification. Importantly, HPE has achieved demonstrable success this year in our ongoing portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin areas aligned to the key market megatrends driving customer demand. I will focus my commentary today on our full-year fiscal year 2023 results and allow Jeremy to expand on the fourth quarter and segment results. I'm very proud of all that HPE delivered in fiscal year 2023 for our shareholders, our customers, and our team members. Our performance demonstrates the relevance of our strategy, our portfolio differentiation, and our strong execution. We delivered extraordinary innovation to customers, resulting in share gains in key markets and profitable growth for our company. HPE generated our highest gross margin and highest operating profits since I became CEO, and our highest annual revenue in four years. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow were the largest ever in our company's history. We saw healthy, sustained growth in revenue at $29.1 billion for the full-year, an increase of 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency, a third straight year of revenue [Technical Difficulty] point of our full fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5%. Gross margins exceeded 35%. We also added substantially to our annualized revenue run rate closing fiscal year 2023 with more than $1.3 billion in ARR. That represents a nearly $370 million increase from this time last year. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was up 20 basis points year-over-year to end the year at 10.8%. We have executed well on our addressable market opportunities and exercised prudence with our expenses and obligations. Non-GAAP EPS increased 6.4% year-over-year to $2.15. Improved profitability also means that we have significantly boosted free cash flows, which rose by about $400 million this year to $2.2 billion, and nearly 25% year-over-year increase. Both non-GAAP, EPS, and free cash flow results are record-breaking and well above our fiscal year 2022 sum guidance. In summary, HPE delivered an impressive set of results in fiscal year 2023. With the progress we have made this year and are confidence in generating further value for our shareholders, we are raising our dividends in 2024. HPE is more relevant than ever to our customers. We have deliberately aligned our strategy over the last few years to significant trends in the market around edge, hybrid cloud, and AI. These growth engines align to our customers' interests and where they are targeting their IT spend. Even against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, we saw continued though uneven, demand across our HPE portfolio with a significant acceleration in AI orders. Demand in our AI solutions is exploding. We saw a significant uptick in customer demand in recent quarters for accelerated computing infrastructure and services. In Q4, orders for servers that include accelerated processing units or APUs represented 32% of our total server order mix, up more than 250% from the beginning of fiscal year 2023. APUs, which includes GPU-based servers orders across our business, represented 25% of our total server order mix in fiscal year 2023. Our HPC & AI segment revenue grew 25% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. We ended this fiscal year with the largest HPC & AI order book on record, driven by $3.6 billion in company-wide APU orders. This tops what has been an historically large order book in the third quarter, as demand accelerated for our supercomputing and AI solutions. We anticipate demand next fiscal year will remain very strong. We likely have a large order backlog and the GPU supply is less constrained. Two weeks ago at the Supercomputing Conference, we expanded our collaboration with NVIDIA to announce a turnkey pre-configured supercomputing solution for generative AI to streamline the model development process. The new solution speeds up the training and fine-tuning of AI models using [Indiscernible] data sets. Designed for large enterprises, research institutions, and government organizations, it comprises HPE AI software, our industry-leading supercomputing and storage solutions. Our HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric and HPE services, and the Quad NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip. Later this week at HPE Discover Barcelona, we will further expand our NVIDIA partnership with new solutions created for enterprise customers. Also this month, the University of Bristol announced that HPE has been selected to deliver the U.K.'s fastest supercomputer, thanks to our U.K. government investment of GPB225 million intended to make the nation a world leader in AI. The Japan National Institute of Information and Communications Technology recently turned to HPE Cray XD supercomputers to develop an AI-based multilingual communication tool to process, translate, and interpret text and images for 17 languages. And we just announced a partnership with Dark Bite a provider of next-generation high-performance computing green data centers to power its AI cloud service with HPE Cray supercomputers and our purpose-built machine learning software suite. With HPE built supercomputers consistently ranked among monthly top 10 within the top 500 most powerful and sustainable supercomputers, our clear leadership in this space continues to position us well in the AI market. Our Intelligent Edge segment was the largest driver of our revenue and profit growth in fiscal year 2023, making up 18% of our overall revenue and 39% of the segment operating profit. Fiscal year 2023 revenue in this segment increased by 45% to $5.2 billion, while operating margins expanded more than 1,200 basis points year-over-year to 27.3%, demonstrating the relevance of our offering and the payoff of investments over time. A critical part of our intelligent edge portfolio in the edge supply portfolio is to continue -- will continue to contribute meaningfully to profitable growth for our shareholders. The compute segment is going through a cyclical period where customers are consuming prior investments making this a price-competitive market for now. As we prepare to capture a greater share of AI linked inferencing opportunities, we saw overall demand improved moderately in the second-half and are encouraged in our outlook for this segment. Customer interest in service with ATUs is growing. We are investing in specialized sales resources that can enhance future growth. We also know we must keep our focus on capturing heavy unit in this business, while keeping balancing our operating margin performance. The overall storage market has been sluggish this year. And on our -- even our uneven performance in this segment is in line with most of our peers. However, we are encouraged with three quarters of stable demand. We saw sequential improvement in storage revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our sales execution capabilities. We recently deployed a large specialized store sales force, including a team devoted to growing our storage IP product mix. We expect our subscription-based offerings and differentiated IP problems like HP Electra will continue to be sources of strong growth to enhance the profitability of this business in the year ahead. We remain focused on advancing our position in Hybrid Cloud. We ended the year with 29,000 customers on our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers require a hybrid by design IT estate. They are attracted to our cloud platform because of its experience, flexibility and cost. In the fourth quarter, we closed our largest HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise deal to-date. In addition, we saw more customer demand around our HPE GreenLake SaaS offerings across data protection, observability and sustainability services. Finally, our HPE Financial Services segment continues to deliver strategic sustainable solutions for customers accelerating our strategy and helping to expand earnings for our shareholders. Financing volumes rose year-over-year with a major contribution from efforts to boost our other service volumes through HP GreenLake. Fiscal year 2023 was an important year for HP, one we advanced our strategy and delivered record financial performance for our shareholders through focused execution and operating discipline. I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and beyond for three main reasons. First, the work we have done over the last several years to innovate and invest in the right places, places where we have the expertise and the ability to scale has given us a portfolio that I believe stands apart from any other. Second we have weathered cyclical dynamics well. While others have had much more severe shift to make, we have been able to stay the course in bringing our strategy to life because we have made operational improvements and have managed expenses in a disciplined way. And finally, we have been bold in undertaking transformation across the company. The changes we have made to our operating model to strengthen capabilities in our growth segment, focus on our road maps across the portfolio, create new customer experience and reach them in new ways will each pay off next year and beyond. We are set up very well to navigate the current climate with and for our customers and to add significantly to the long-term profitability and value we create for our shareholders. While headwinds remain in certain segments of the IT market, HPE is positioned very well to continue our momentum, and we are lesser focused in areas where we know we can do more to improve our performance. I hope you share my optimism in what HP can achieve in the year ahead. Let me now invite Jeremy to discuss the fourth quarter and specific same year results. So Jeremy, over to you. Jeremy Cox : Thank you very much, Antonio. We closed FY '23 with another solid performance. Our Q4 results reflect our strategic focus to diversify our business towards higher growth, higher margin areas of the market. The company's transformation we have undertaken several years ago to pivot to edge and cloud is paying off. And with AI exploding in 2023, we see several promising indicators as we look further in 2024 and despite some unevenness in some areas of the IT market where we participate. Q4 performance was highlighted by healthy revenues and gross margins. Revenue grew 5% sequentially in constant currency to $7.4 billion. hitting the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance range. Year-over-year revenue, however, was down 6% on a difficult compare to Q4 '22, during which significant order book consumption boosted our results. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 34.8%, which was up 170 basis points year-over-year, largely due to the increasing contribution of our Intelligent Edge segment. Let me remind you of the deliberate targeted investment decisions we made in Q4 that I flagged to SAM, which were funded with the better-than-expected OIE performance in the same period. The impact of this investment, along with the strong seasonal growth in HPC and AI resulted in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7%. This is down 60 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to quickly be over in Q1 '24. This led to GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52, which was at the high end of our Q4 guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52. Our Q4 free cash flow of $2.3 billion was record-breaking for the company. HPE also delivered an impressive full year performance in FY '23. We delivered revenue growth of 5.5% in constant currency which was at the upper end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Currency was a 330 basis point headwind for the year. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.15 and was also at the high end of our prior guidance and well above our initial guidance from SAM 2022 $1.96 to $2.04. FY '23 free cash flow of $2.2 billion was well above our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Let's now turn to our segment results. As a reminder, all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency and I will discuss the segments in our prior structure. The company is now operating according to our new structure. And as communicated at SAM, we plan to file restated historical financials for the new segments well before we report our Q1 '24 results. In Intelligent Edge, we grew revenue 40% year-over-year in Q4. Demand in our core product was down sequentially on customer digestion, but grew in our software-centric solutions such as our HP Aruba Central cloud management software and in our new TAM opportunities such as our SASE security software suite. Our operating margin of 29.5% was up more than 1,600 basis points year-over-year. While very pleased with this performance, we continue to expect a mid-20% operating margin over time as communicated at SAM 2023. And finally, we're making progress on our order book and expect to be back close to historical normal levels by midyear 2024. In HPC & AI, Q4 revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 41% sequentially. Q4 revenue results included only a modest amount of AI revenue. On a sequential basis, the continued strength in AI demand lifted our order book in the HPC & AI segment to more than $3 billion, despite our significant revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in the segment over the next three years, and we are increasingly confident we will be above trend in FY '24 with GPU supply or gating factor. Our Q4 operating margin was 4.7%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and 550 basis points sequentially. While we have much more progress to make, this does illustrate the positive benefits of scale. The early stage of the AI market, tightness in certain key accelerators and long lead times in this segment means that the HPC & AI margins will fluctuate. Storage revenues fell 12% year-over-year on a difficult compare, but rose 3% sequentially. Storage demand has now been flat to up for three straight quarters. HPE Electra revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and it will remain a robust growth contributor in FY '24, supported by growth in file and object storage. HPE Electra is shifting our mix within storage to higher-margin software subscription revenue, which is a key driver of our ARR growth. Q4 storage operating margin of 8.1% was down 730 basis points year-over-year. Headwinds included the deferred revenue impact of the HP Electro subscription software, accelerated investment outpacing year-over-year revenue performance and a high mix of third-party products this quarter. Our investments in product portfolio give us confidence storage will make progress through FY '24 toward our long-term operating profit margin target communicated at SAM 2023 of mid-teens. Compute revenue was down 30% year-over-year on a difficult compare and down 1% sequentially. De elongation and customer digestion, we discussed previously continued to be most prevalent in compute. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a meaningful driver. However, two straight quarters of sequential improvement in demand lends further confidence to our FY '24 outlook. Our full-year operating margin of 13.7% exceeded our target range of 11% to 13%, but the operating margin of 9.8% in Q4 was temporarily below the range. Given gross margins remain largely flat sequentially and the sequential demand increases, we continue to expect operating margins to be in the target range for FY '24. HPE Financial Services revenues were flat year-over-year and financing volume was $1.5 billion. Our operating margin of 8.9% was down 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting rapid intra sites that we are offsetting through pricing as well as asset management margins returning to normal as supply challenges ease. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Let's double-click on our portfolio pivot to higher growth, higher margin recurring revenue and in particular, to Intelligent Edge. Even three years ago, the Intelligent Edge segment constituted just 10% of segment revenue. This year, it represented 18%. The operating profit trajectory is even more telling. The Intelligent Edge segment contributed approximately 14% of the segment's operating profit three years ago and was nearly 40% in FY '23. In FY '24, we intend to give you a similar view combining our growth pillars of HPC and AI, hybrid cloud and intelligent edge segments. Within that, we expect the Intelligent Edge segment growth to moderate in the HPC & AI segment growth to accelerate. Robust demand in our hybrid cloud and as-a-service offerings illustrates the durability of our portfolio shift. ARR exceeded $1.3 billion in Q4. This represented 37% year-over-year growth, which is in line with our long-term CAGR target of 35% to 45%. Storage and Intelligent Edge software and services are the fastest-growing components of ARR. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin recurring software and services revenue. Our software and services mix was 68% in the quarter. We expect this mix to increase into the upper 70% range by FY '26. This expansion is driven by the growth of subscription-based software with our products and the increased attach of our HPE operational services, which rose double-digits in Q4. The rising software and services mix is expanding our as-a-service margins. Our as-a-service orders grew 11% year-over-year in Q4 and finished the year up a solid 23% after 68% growth in FY '22. Our cumulative as-a-service TCV has now increased to nearly $13 billion. As ARR is now on a clear path to meaningful scale, we will simplify our as-a-service disclosure from ARR as-a-service orders in TCV to only ARR in FY \u201824. The explosion in AI demand is driving robust growth in our APU orders. Total APU orders, which include APUs in our compute, Cray EX and Cray XD businesses totaled $3.6 billion in FY '23, which is up from the over $3 billion we disclosed at SAM 2023. HPE Cray XD APU orders accelerated in Q3 and in Q4, reaching $2.4 billion for the year. The impressive APU server demand is also evident in our total server demand. APUs represented 25% of total server order dollars in FY '23, up from 10% in the prior year. We will continue to disclose APU orders. However, orders can be easily north of $100 million each, therefore, orders may be lumpy. But the key point is that we are capturing AI demand now and are well positioned for coming demand across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. Our strategy is delivering top line growth and gross margin expansion. Despite the challenging macro ongoing product digestion and currency headwinds, we still produced one of our highest quarterly revenue figures since 2018, while sustaining our expanded gross margin profile. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin rose 170 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%. And our full year non-GAAP gross margin rose 140 basis points to 35.3%. That's a more than 500 basis point improvement from FY '18. Moving to free cash flow. In Q4, we generated $2.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Our $2.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '23 was above the high end of our guidance and up meaningfully from $1.8 billion in FY '22, primarily on improved earnings and net income conversion. We exited FY '23 with a cash conversion cycle of negative four days, which exceeded our expectation for neutral we communicated at SAM. Strong working capital management in Q4 and reduced transformation costs in FY '23 drove an improvement in our conversion of non-GAAP net earnings to free cash flow to approximately 80% in FY '23. Continued progress in FY \u201824 and beyond leads us to expect to reach 90% by FY '26. We reiterate our FY \u201824 free cash flow guidance from SAM of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders in FY \u201823, including $421 million in share repurchases. While certain price and volume parameters of our trading program limited us to below our $500 million target in FY \u201823, we reiterate our goal of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders between FY '24 and FY '26. Before we dive into our outlook, let me remind you that we will exclude H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results in FY '24 as we noted at SAM. We continue to expect the process to conclude and the receipt of the cash proceeds in the first-half of calendar 2024. For Q1, we expect revenues in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.3 billion. This incorporates historical seasonality in our overall business, including in the HPC & AI segment after its strong Q4. We expect AI revenue acceleration to drive sequential growth in HPC & AI and total HPE revenue in Q2 '24. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.24 and $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.42 and $0.50. We're reiterating our prior year 2024 guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect OI&E, which as noted, excludes HCC going forward to be a headwind of approximately $300 million and our non-GAAP structural tax rate to be 15%. Our full-year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.81 to $2.01 is $0.02 lower than our prior view as a bit of transformation costs slipped into FY '24. We are reiterating our full-year non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.82 to $2.02. We also reiterate free cash flow guidance of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. We continue to believe our FY '24 performance will be weighted to the second-half of the year as GPU supply improves. We are increasing our dividend by 8% in FY '24 and intend to return 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. So to conclude, while there continues to be unevenness in some areas of the IT market, our investment in growing areas of our portfolio is paying off. We are confident in our ability to continue to capture the AI explosion in demand. AI also opens broader customer discussions about the benefits of AI inferencing at the edge and the need to be hybrid by design. Our HPE GreenLake Cloud platform, our AI native portfolio, and our services expertise are perfectly aligned to the needs of our customers that we believe will turn into profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let's open it up for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mike Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have one on the APU orders of $3.6 billion. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mix between compute, supercomputing and Cray XD. And if you could offer any color on the type of customers that are making this order? Is this your typical enterprise customer? Is it more of a Tier 2 or AI CSP? Any thoughts there would be great. Antonio Neri : Well, thanks, Mike. This is Antonio. So pretty much all the orders are in the HPC and AI segment, the vast majority. We saw now in Q4 some uptick in demand in the what I call the traditional compute. But what you have to think about it is AI is a life cycle, right? training to tuning to inferencing. And the products we talk here, whether it's HPE Cray, XD or EX really are on the training side and the tuning side. And so when I think about the type of customers, I think about the model builders, right? So these are unique customers that in the past with generally, we have talk about it. Think about companies like Recussion, Pharmaceutical, Cruso energy, obviously, large language models like Aleph Alpha, Tiger Data or Northern Data, Geo Research and the like. These are big mobile builders, and they need a large amount of computational power. Now when we start seeing as an uptick in the tuning side with enterprises, because generally, they don't tend to build models. They tend to leverage foundation models in the open source or some of these companies provide and then they tune those models with their data, but they want to do it in a private secure and obviously sustainable way. And that's why we have made announcements with NVIDIA, and you can see further announcements later in the week. And then AI inferencing, I call it for using a sport analogy, singles and the doubles, right? So these are maybe a server with eight GPUs or accelerated resorts where they start deploying these models, they have been trained attuned into production and think about where their real-time processing data happen where business transformation takes place or maybe doing some sort of POC or pretraining experiments. And so now we start seeing that increasing. But the vast majority of compute is still CPU centric, and we saw some uptick in the GPUs. But the vast majority of all the APUs that we talked about are in the traditional high density for training and tuning, and that's where our HPE Cray set of platforms plays a big role. And obviously, they also find its way to supercomputing at large scale that we have talked about from TRL Capital and in Aurora, [Indiscernible] and Norsk and the like. Anything you want to add? Jeremy Cox : The only thing I would just add to that is the supercomputing piece, specific to your question, is less than 10% in the total APU orders in FY '23. The other interesting point to add on to the journey towards inferencing that Antonio mentioned is within compute, although against a very small base, we did see non-Tier 1 customer orders around GPU or APUs for compute increased about 100% in the quarter. So again, against a small base, but an interesting point to see the focus start moving towards that realm. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Jeremy. And again, only 10% of the POs were consumed in Supercompute rest was all in AI. Okay, thank you, Mike. Jeffrey Kvaal : Thanks, Mike. Gary, the next question please? Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. Antonio, we've seen some networking companies talk about a slowdown and some inventory digestion. You're still delivering very strong growth in edge high 30s. I know you called out a more front-end loaded performance for Edge. But curious how you're thinking about the weight and pace of that business trajectory both on revenue and margin terms as you go through the course of the year? Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. I'm going to talk about demand and then Jeremy can talk about revenue margin, which we were very clear that right, what to expect. Obviously, we have driven a significant growth over the last two years. I think it was the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. That's very impressive, we added $2 billion of revenue in the last 2 years. And obviously, that came with an expanded set of gross margins because of our software and subscription-based models that we have been driving. Traditionally, we think about that has been in the campus and branch, where in our switching or Wi-Fi. But more and more lately, obviously, it's all software-driven and as well as expansion into the new times we discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, including SD1 and security to create the SSC framework or the SASE framework we talked about it. And going forward, we are also going to add the private 5G, which we discussed. And let's not forget, we have been also gaining momentum in the data center with our offers, which are an extension of our switching portfolio in the data center. So definitely was a quarter-over-quarter slight decline in orders for demand for products in the campus and branch, but we saw strong demand in the software in the security space. And that's why at the securities and analyst meeting with Phil, we talked about this multiple ad adjacency we have add to the platform, and they are all incorporated into the HPE Aruba Central platform, which is part of HPE GreenLake. So again, we are committed to grow revenues next year on the higher pace that we created, again, on the $5.2 billion we just delivered. Albeit you should not expect a 40% growth, obviously. And that's why I want to have Jeremy talk about what we are affirming here in terms of revenue and as well as margins. Jeremy Cox : Right. Yes. We -- as Antonio mentioned, we did, as Sam mentioned, a slight growth we're expecting year-over-year on a full year basis for Edge. As I think about that, I'd almost break that down into two halves. The first-half, as we mentioned, we do still benefit from a backlog position or an order book position that will go into the first half and help support that revenue performance. And then the second half will be more dependent on demand improvements. and in the areas that Antonio mentioned and the investment areas that were helping drive that expectation. From an operating margin perspective, I would say that I would expect the first half to still benefit from higher operating margins as again, the order book consumption has been at higher price with lower cost. So that's helped drive our operating margin performance, which again this quarter at 29.5% is exceptional. But we would expect to probably more in the second-half, you'll start seeing that operating margin rate get more back towards the mid-20s that we had mentioned at SAM is our expectation for the long-term in this business. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much, Wamsi. Gary, could we have the next question. Operator : The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes. Thank you. If I look at your -- take the midpoint of your first quarter revenue guide, and I run out normal seasonality I get revenues down about 5% for the year. You've just stated that the edge business is going to be weaker in the second-half, so below normal seasonality. So clearly, you're expecting a huge ramp in HPC in AI over the course of the year? And I'm wondering if you can dimension that or -- are you expecting greater than normal seasonality in the traditional server business? And why would that be? And then finally, can you just comment on total backlog for HPC and AI exiting the quarter, you said it was $3 billion exiting last quarter or greater than $3 billion. What is it today? Thank you. Jeremy Cox : Toni, this is Jeremy. I'll take those two for you. So you're spot on as we think about next year, we will have a seasonal drop in HPC and AI. That's largely as Q4 really benefited from a meaningful amount of Cray Ex acceptances. And as you know, the time between order and acceptance can be a long period of time and Q4 saw a larger number of acceptances, which helped drive the revenue performance. We'll see a bit of a dip back down in Q1 and then Q2 and the second-half really benefiting from the acceleration in AI, as well as some additional supercomputing business. And so you'll see a pretty significant ramp as we go from Q1 to Q2 and then sustaining at or ramping beyond that in the second-half of the year. And HPC and AI will be a big part of the revenue growth story for FY '24. Your question on the order book total, it landed at just over $3.2 billion, which was slightly above where we landed in Q3. And that really came off the back, though of Q4 revenue performance in HPC & AI up about $350 million on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And so what happened is you had a runoff of order book from revenue performance in Q4 and then how to rebuild of that order book coming largely from AI demand in Q4 that took it back up to its historical high level of just over $3.2 billion. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much, Toni. Gary? Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess in your prepared remarks, you did make it a point to highlight the uneven demand backdrop that you're seeing. I was wondering if you can flesh that out a bit more in terms of what you're seeing between the different product groups. And particularly when I look at that in contrast to the strong AI demand you're seeing, would you really sort of then see some of the AI demand from enterprises cannibalizing their own spend towards the other product groups? Or is the uneven demand more of inventory correction? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes, sure. I mean no question, we see an explosion in demand in AI. Jeremy just comment on that. And I will say, of that order book that Jeremy just talked about in Q4, [Indiscernible] little was converted in AI. And to the point he made the growth we had in Q4 was driven by the supercomputer acceptances. But we have a very, very large pipeline in front of us, which is very exciting but ultimately it's going to come down to time to revenue based on the GPU availability. But I will say that business is going to continue to be super strong. And clearly, when I speak to customers, which I do more than 50% of my time there is a huge amount of interest in AI and how to accelerate the deployment of a higher cost enterprise, understand that there are challenges, whether it's sustainability challenges, where there are data center capacity, power and cooling and others. And that's why HPE went bold on that front last June to basically make the announcement we're going to offer supercomputing as a public cloud instance so customers can use it as a virtual private cloud. So that we feel very good about it. Green Lake continued to be very strong. Just to be in a context, we added $1 billion in TCV quarter-over-quarter. We added 2,000 customers, and ARR obviously, is a function of the deferred revenue that we materialize over time, but what customers really love about our experience is that it's hybrid by design. They can consume anything from Edge to cloud to HPE GreenLake, where they pay CapEx or OpEx, it doesn't really matter in the end. But they really love the experience. And that's why we're building the AI components into the same platform. So those are two very strong. Edge obviously had tremendous momentum. I think we're going to have the typical adjustments, but that's why we spend a lot of energy and time on adding more capabilities to the edge platform security as one private 5G data center networking, which adds to the momentum, understanding there will be potentially some digestion in the campus and branch. But as Jeremy said, we have very well covered for the first half of 2024. So we have to see that. And then compute, right, is a typical business that goes through this cyclicality, right? So last year, obviously, we had a huge amount of orders we converted the order faster than people expected. And in the back half of this year, we saw sequential demand improvements in units and stable AUPs. And now we start seeing upticks in the mix with AI inferencing, which has these accelerators. But Q3 demand was higher than Q2 and Q4 was higher than Q3. So I think it's fair to say we are stabilized, and we are improving. I would not call it yet a recovery. And on storage, I believe we're going to see some improvements over time because of AI demand, which require file and object and we have a great portfolio with HPE Eletra, and we intend to capitalize on that. But for three consecutive quarters now, we have seen stability and improvement. And in Q4, we saw revenue improvements on a sequential basis. So customers are prioritizing the spend where it makes sense, but ultimately we have a portfolio that can meet their needs, wherever they are and HPE GreenLake is the way we deliver all of this which ultimately for shareholders drives higher margins and higher reported revenues and profit. Sorry? Jeff Kvaal : Cannibalization. Antonio Neri : Cannibalization. Sorry, Jeff, remind me, cannibalization. We have no evidence of that yet. I think that will become clear when the traditional compute CPU-driven returned to some normal levels. But remember, not every customer has deployed cloud across that enterprise. Still quite a bit of journey to go. And there are clear customers assessing what is the best place to deploy that, whether it's in a power cloud or whether it's repatriating on-prem because of the cost or because of data. I think AI is a huge driver of repatriation in my mind because if you have data distributed across multiple states, it's very hard to really train and fine-tune the models when you have data everywhere. And our focus there is really providing them an automated data pipeline with our unified analytics platform. So fundamentally, it's early to say. But so far, in the traditional compute business, we have not seen evidence of cannibalization at this point in time. Jeff Kvaal : Samik, thank you, Gary. Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk a bit about the trends you're seeing in compute for the non-accelerated platforms. And really, the thing I'm trying to tease out here is sort of this issue of a projects, pulling budget or sucking oxygen on the room versus organizations buying up compute platforms to prepare for AI inferencing and embracing AI as an inferencing element, not just training? Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Simon. Again, maybe I will elaborate a little more to the comments I made before. So we saw Q4 over Q3 and Q3 over Q2 improvement in demand in units. And a lot of that was CPU-driven. Although there is a small base of AI accelerated kind of APUs, if you will, that we saw an increase in Q4. But I will say the unit growth in Q4 was not driven by the APUs, it was driven by a combination of CPUs, the vast majority and some APUs because the base is still very, very small. So definitely, customers are preparing for that. Again, they are all assessing what is the best place to deploy this model. That's why I do believe the inferencing side will accelerate over time, where we have to do some pre-training or POCs or really deploying in production. And I think many customers also will accelerate deployments of tuning solutions on-prem because of the data aspect I talked before. No question is still digesting what they bought last time on the CPU side of the house. But again, we saw some improvements in demand sequentially in units. And then let's remind ourselves that we also, for us, in the industry. We are going to the transition of Sapphire Rapids. And ultimately, we call that the Gen 11 platform. That became now, what, Jeremy? 25% of the mix which... Jeremy Cox : 53% of orders in Q4. Antonio Neri : 53% of the orders in Q4, 25% of the revenue mix. And so that's good for us because, obviously, it drives higher density and obviously, we can attach more options to the same platform. And customers like the sustainability piece of that and the hybrid by design nature of that, which is actually well optimized. And Gen 11, by the way, was conceived to accept any type of processing unit, whether it's a CPU, but it's an APU, including ARM-based solutions or GPU-based solutions. Whether it's in tail on the X86. So that gives us tremendous amount of flexibility. But ultimately, it's not just about the server. It's the software that comes with it. And this is where we spend a lot of time building the partnerships and relationships with NVIDIA. So now you can deploy a tuning or inferencing with the NVIDIA stack and our software as well, all part of HPE GreenLake. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you very much, Simon. Gary? Operator : The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Can you just touch on the storage business a little bit. It's been kind of challenged like some of the other businesses on macro. Could you talk a little bit about the outlook for recovery there? And also, if you could just touch on the third-party business there that's kind of impacted gross margin profitability, how does that look to be trending as we look out over the next year or two? Thank you. Jeremy Cox : Sure. I can take that particularly towards the latter part of that. I think Antonio already hit on some of the demand dynamics, again, where we've seen three quarters of flat to increasing demand, and so some positive trends from that perspective. I think from an operating margin perspective, certainly, we saw a reduction in Q4. That was driven off a combination of several things, including a higher third-party mix that you mentioned. As well as the fact that we see -- we saw some incremental OpEx in this segment and that OpEx as a comparison to the revenue performance in the quarter also put pressure onto that operating margin. However, we do expect a pretty quick recovery there. We -- as we look into Q1, in particular, revenue is not expected to accelerate meaningfully, but we think the mix will improve as far as towards our IP product. And the -- we should see some OpEx moderation and favorability as we go into the quarter coming out of Q4 and some of the investments that we made there. And so I expect to see that get back into a low double-digit kind of area. And then as we work through the quarter, and that IP mix starts to improve more on demand acceleration, then we should start seeing us working back towards our mid-teen target that we identified at SAM for this segment. Antonio Neri : I will say also, if you look at our HP Electra product, it's the fastest ramp we ever had in the history of the company. This quarter, this past quarter grew another 50%. But also there is some short-term impact because a portion of that revenue gets deferred because the subscription is softer on the platform. And so that was an intentional strategy because ultimately, the infrastructure is one piece of it, but the operating system and the cloud services that comes with it are actually a subscription to HPE GreenLake. So while we're growing 50%, we are not materializing the full revenue because a portion of that gets deferred at least to over three years. And that's good because ultimately it comes to a significant higher margins for us. But our strategy is to dramatically improve the mix to IT. And you will see more announcement this week in the storage portfolio, all geared to the AI opportunity. We file an object and that will accelerate some of the momentum we have in the storage portfolio. Operator : The next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : I want to ask about ARR, and it was flat quarter-over-quarter, but still up very strongly, 39% year-over-year. Can you walk us through the dynamics why it didn't change in the quarter? You just talked about GreenLake being very strong multiple times. Are there some negatives maybe some cancellations offsetting the growth? Or is that more a pause of the two very, very strong quarters? And lastly, was there much contribution from AI servers in the AR number at this point? Jeremy Cox : I'll take that. So just on the last point, no, there wasn't any meaningful AI impact, but we do expect that to be an accelerator, particularly in FY '24 as we go to Q2 and towards the second half. That will be a big part of our ARR story, and we expect that to be an accelerator for us in FY '24. On the quarter-over-quarter, this business, similar to what I mentioned on the supercomputing area does have some time between order to revenue recognition. In this case, when ARR begins to be reported. And so I think the sequential story was more about. Early in the year, we had seen more as the backlog had been burning down and some of those deals that have been waiting in the pipeline turning into -- and converting that helped drive and accelerate the ARR through the first 3 quarters. We saw a little bit less of that in Q4. But I don't think that it all as an indication of a slowdown in this space. In fact, between the 35% and 45% kind of CAGR or annual growth, I expect us in FY '24 to see the higher end of that range. Jeff Kvaal : Sidney, there's some rounding in there that we can talk through. But thank you. Gary, this should be our last question, I think. Operator : And our final question will be from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Mary on for Meta Marshall. I just had a question on demand trends. Can you speak to linearity within the quarter and whether pockets of weakness you saw during the quarter changed as the quarter went on? Antonio Neri : Yes. I think overall it was more back ended, I would say, in the quarter, we saw strengthening as we went through the weeks. As always said, we have 13 weeks in the quarter, and we saw stronger momentum as we built along the way. And remember what we said the same, right? So as SAM as said year-to-date to October '19, I think, was the sun date. We had $3 billion in cumulative orders both between supercomputer and AI specifically and we ended the year at 3.6%. So in the last 12 days with $600 million in incremental AI orders. That tells you the strong. It was through also for compute and storage. By the way, the last few weeks, call it, three, four, five weeks were stronger than the beginning of the quarter. So I would not make much out of that. Sometimes customers take the time. We still actually live in elongated flow cycles. That's for sure. Customers taking more time to make those decisions. and ultimately issue the POs. But what really is giving me the confidence is the strong pipeline we have ahead of us. That's obvious. And clearly, in AI is significantly stronger than we ever imagined. And the only challenge we have there, then as Jeremy said, right, so it's time to revenue. We really recognize very little revenue in AI in Q4. That's why we expect the acceleration starting in Q2 and beyond as lead times improve and some of the supercomputing also gets accepted. But the reality, 2024 will be the year of AI revenue growth. And then in the edge, obviously, we have the momentum that we talked about in the subscription, the scale of our software and the incremental engines that we have. So overall, it was a typical quarter, but stronger on the back versus the front. Yes. I think we have time for one more. Antonio Neri : Let's do one more. Thanks Gary, please. Maybe just one more question. Operator : Thanks for the final question. will be from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thank you guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron I just want to ask around AI software. Can you just help us appreciate or understand how your own AI software solutions that you guys talked about at SAM compared to NVIDIA's own AI software suite. I'm just trying to understand is yourself for a complementary or is it more of a substitute? Just how to think about that overall. Thank you. Antonio Neri : No, great question. And I will say, overall, there is a lot of complementary and there are some places overlap, obviously. But with Jens and the team, we have a clear joint plan to win together in different segments of the market. But let me break it out because we talk about software in general terms, but let's start first at the infrastructure level. we have unique software that allows us to run these supercomputers and AI system, which are cloud native by nature at massive scale. Think about when you run a model you need to start and complete the mobile training. And you have to have unique technologies for checkpoints and making sure that all the compute power is acting as unified system because unlike the public cloud or the cloud, as we know it, you are multiple loads on multiple nodes. In this case, you run one world nodes on multiple nodes. And that's parallel computing as we know it. And ultimately, you need the software to run this at scale. The magic around that is that checkpoint. And then the second piece of that is our networking interconnect fabric which allows us to really connect every accelerated unit to every accelerated unit in a cohesive approach. And that's our Slingshot contingent fabric as we know it. And then on top of that, we have our machine learning development environment. This is where developers and the like use our machine learning development services. to prepare the models to automate the data pipeline. One of the biggest challenges customers have is to prepare the data, data is everywhere, but ultimate bringing in terms sort of one place so you can use data to train the models. And then with NVIDIA, we use their AI enterprise software, including some of the foundation models that they provide order to provide a complete solution. And obviously, we leverage their APUs, call it, GPUs, whether it's H-100-L40-OL4S, A100s in the past and going forward as the announcement we made a supercomputing 2023 in Denver, we are leveraging the grace over Edge 200. So it's a combination, depending on the use case. And we feel pretty good about what we're doing and stay tuned because Thursday, we're going to make further announcements about our partnership with NVIDIA. But it's RAP and IP that makes us together unique and differentiated in the AI space. Okay. Well, thank you, everyone. I will appreciate always the time. I know you're busy cover in all the earnings, but I will say just to wrap in fiscal year 2023. Clearly, we demonstrated our strategic investments and the extraordinary innovation across the growth areas of edge, hybrid cloud and even compute for the matter are really resonating with customers. and is helping us tolerate revenue growth and profit diversification. That's why you see the growth in gross margin and profit. And I believe we will continue to capitalize on this growing market opportunities. And I'm confident to continue to increase the returns to our shareholders. And that's why we are raising the dividend for 2024. So thank you for your time today. I wish you all fulfilling end of the calendar year and a special holiday season. Talk to you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for attending the presentation. You may now disconnect.",

A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes. We have posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying the release on our HPE Investor Relations web page.  With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thank you, Shannon. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter, we are proud to have outpaced our profitability expectations while advancing our long-term strategy. We also continue to scale our recurring revenue, achieving the second highest year-over-year growth rate since we started tracking ARR in late 2019. This is a promising indicator for our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin revenues. But overall, Q1 revenue performance did not meet our expectations. During this call, I will address three key points. First, I will touch on our revenue, which was lower than expected in large part because network and demand softened industry-wide and because the timing of several large GPU acceptances shifted. Additionally, we did not have the GPU supply we wanted, curtailing our revenue upside.  Second, I will address how we are streamlining our reporting segments, accelerating a new specialized sales model, managing our spending and reinforcing execution discipline. Third and most importantly, I will discuss the progress we're making in executing our long-term strategy, which we remain confident in. Let me first address revenue in the quarter. Similar to peers in the market, we saw campus networking product demand weakened and the decline later in the quarter was greater than expected. This was a large headwind relative to our expectations. Customers are taking longer to digest prior orders than we had anticipated, which partially offset the benefit of our backlog entering the quarter. And Europe and Asia were areas of relative softness. We expect weakness in the networking market to persist, which is likely to impact revenue through fiscal year 2024. That said, we anticipate some improvement late in fiscal year 2024 as inventory clears and we ramp into the purchasing season for state and local education customers in the United States. AI server demand remains very strong, evidenced by our growing cumulative order book. However, GPU availability remains tight, and our delivery timing has also been affected by the increasing length of time customers require to set up the data center space, power and cooling requirements needed to run these systems.  As a result, overall AI server orders conversion was below our expectations. However, the AI contribution to ARR is increasing. We continue to prioritize profitability. I am pleased that we have delivered non-GAAP gross margin of 36.2%, which is up 200 basis points year-over-year and above 600 basis points from fiscal year 2018. This performance helped our Q1 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share grow to $0.48, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range despite lower-than-expected revenue, illustrating the positive impact of our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue.  We know that the current environment will require continued discipline in how we execute. We are accelerating new specialized sales motions to maximize opportunities and improve order linearity across our portfolio. Improved cost management will remain an important competency for us in fiscal year 2024.  We also found opportunity to streamline our reporting segments. We have now combined the Compute and HPC and AI segments into a single server segment that integrates general-purpose computing, high-performance computing, supercomputing, and AI systems. This will enable us to maximize the opportunities across the entire AI life cycle, from training to tuning to inferencing and execute with agility.  And as previously discussed, we have simplified our hybrid cloud strategy by putting all related products, software and services into one business unit. Our new hybrid cloud segment will further accelerate customer adoption of the HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform. Turning to our strategy. While we are experiencing cyclicality in submarkets, I am more confident than ever in our long-term strategy that is aligned to key market mega trends. In edge, over the last several quarters, we have gained share in the campus networking markets and our strategic investments have played off. Most recently, we have seen strong growth in SASE, an offering bolstered by our acquisition of Silver Peak in 2020 and Axis Security in 2023. Our sales pipeline for our private 5G offering is also growing rapidly, following our acquisition of Athonet in 2023. In hybrid cloud, HPE GreenLake continues to resonate in the marketplace and was the private driver of the highest Q1 year-over-year rise in ARR over the 4-plus years we have been reporting it. Our ARR grew 41% year-over-year to more than $1.4 billion in Q1, and we continue to expect ARR growth of 35% to 45% as we look ahead. We're also capitalizing on cross-selling opportunities when customers come to us for our AI solutions and realize we can meet their storage needs as well. In AI, we are capturing the explosion in demand for AI systems. Our cumulative accelerator processing unit orders rose to $4 billion in the quarter, driven by demand across HPE Cray EX and XT solutions, as well as HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI-optimized servers. AP orders represent nearly 25% of our total server orders since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Our pipeline is large and growing across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. We are starting to see AI demand pull-through for other solutions, including storage. We expect our server and hybrid cloud segments to grow sequentially through the fiscal year. Server revenue stands to benefit from AI system demand, improving GPU supply, and our continued mix shift to HPE ProLiant Gen11. Hybrid cloud will benefit from continued HPE GreenLake storage demand and the rising productivity of our specialized sales force.  Our customers continue to validate our value proposition. As one example, we are building for A&E, one of the world's largest energy providers, a new HPE Cray EX supercomputer that will reach more than half an exaflop performance. The system will be one of the most powerful in the world for enterprise use and will accelerate AI-driven scientific discovery to advance efforts in energy. We also have been awarded the deal for Poland's most powerful supercomputer system located at the Academic Computer Center Cipher Net of the AGH University of Science and Technology. Based on the HPE Cray EX supercomputer and HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric with NVIDIA Grace Hopper GPUs, the system will be used to support modeling simulation and AI-driven scientific research needs, including training and tuning of large language models. We're also seeing growth in AI inferencing. For example, Coles Supermarkets, a leading Australian retailer, implemented an HPE ProLiant Gen11 AI inferencing solution in Q1, which helps with video imaging to reduce store stock lost to theft and scanning at the checkout. In the quarter, we expanded our strategic collaboration with NVIDIA targeting the enterprise segment of the market. We introduced a preconfigured solution for enterprise customers to fine-tune AI large language models with their private data to accelerate inferencing. Our HPE machine learning development environment software and unique HPE supercomputer and IP are critical parts of the solution, alongside NVIDIA AI enterprise software. We have built a strong and growing sales pipeline for this new offering. We also continue to build out our HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud platform services. Earlier this quarter, we announced an expanded HPE GreenLake for file storage that is designed for generative AI. This solution is highly differentiated through a high-performant file system solution specifically designed for AI applications. We believe it better positions us to take market share in storage by addressing the previously underserved segment of the file market.  Innovation like this continue to attract customers to HPE GreenLake platform, which connects 3.8 million network devices and supports more than 31,000 customer organizations, up approximately 8% from last quarter. One new HPE GreenLake customer is the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center, which produces critical models of weather and ocean conditions for the U.S. and coalition forces worldwide. They turned to HPE GreenLake to improve predictability, accuracy and speed of their modeling while reducing costs.  This week, I attended the Mobile World Congress where AI and private 5G were the key topics among telcos and service providers alike. With our pending acquisition of Juniper Networks, HPE's portfolio will expand to better serve these unique customers from the edge of the network to core 5G to cloud. Customers were very interested in our integration of Athonet private 5G capabilities into our Intelligent Edge portfolio as well as in our cloud OpenRAN and VRAN solutions. They were also very eager to explore the massive new market opportunity AI inferencing presents at the edge of the network.  That is one of the reasons why we're so excited about our pending Juniper Networks acquisition. Combining our complementary portfolios will supercharge HPE's edge-to-cloud strategy, accelerating our entire portfolio with AI-enabled innovation. When our proposed acquisition closes, we will create a new networking innovator, with our comprehensive portfolio for and partners. The transaction is expected to double the size of our networking business, which will be the core foundation of covering the anticipated $180 billion market opportunity with our combined IP. From a financial perspective, this transaction is also compelling for our shareholders. In the first year post close, we expect accretion to non-GAAP earnings per share and, in the long term, higher non-GAAP gross and operating margins. We are working to secure regulatory approvals in several jurisdictions. We are hopeful that regulators will recognize that this acquisition is centered around driving further innovation for our customers. We continue to expect that the transaction will close later this calendar year or in early calendar 2025. In summary, Q1 2024 was a mixed quarter for HPE. We achieved strong profitability and drove new record ARR growth with overall revenue short-term expectations, given the softening networking market, GPU deal timing and, to some extent, GPU availability. We are focused on execution as we navigate the fluctuations demand we see in certain areas of the market.  Marie will take you through our adjusted guidance, which reflects our latest thinking about the year ahead. This quarter is a moment in time and does not at all dampen our confidence in the future ahead of us. We have taken the right actions to maximize value for our shareholders. The work we are doing now, combined with our technological edge and our strategy that has never been more relevant, will position us to convert on the long-term opportunities in front of us across edge, hybrid cloud, and AI. Before we transition, I'm delighted to welcome Marie Myers as our new CFO. Having worked with her at HP before the separation, it is a pleasure to partner with her again. I am passion for and skill ad, fueling innovation and performance. I am confident that Marie is a great fit for this role and expect she will help drive the next phase of growth and shareholder return for HPE.  I will now turn the call over to her for details about our segments and our outlook. Marie? Marie Myers : Thank you, Antonio. I'm pleased to be with you today on my first earnings call as HPE's CFO. I've long admired HPE's impressive transformation, and there has never been a more exciting time to be part of this company. We have a growing addressable market, a proven strategy and a differentiated portfolio that is levered to long-term market trends around networking, hybrid cloud and AI. I believe we have a significant opportunity ahead of us. I'm excited to partner with Antonio and the rest of the outstanding HPE team to capitalize on this opportunity and drive value for our shareholders. And as Antonio mentioned, we have much to be proud of. Financial highlights in the quarter included record gross margins and expense discipline, which helped lift non-GAAP EPS to the high end of our guidance range. Demand for our traditional server and storage products has stabilized. Demand for our HPE GreenLake offerings was evident in a healthy ARR growth and demand for our AI systems remains robust.  However, demand in Intelligent Edge did soften due to customer digestion of strong product shipments in fiscal year '23, which is lasting longer than we initially anticipated and is the primary reason Q1 revenue came in below our expectations. GPU availability and deal timing also contributed. We are taking swift action to address these headwinds by curtailing costs and driving efficiencies across the business. With that, let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue fell 14% year-over-year in constant currency to $6.8 billion. Please recall, we had significant backlog consumption in Q1 '23, particularly in traditional servers and storage. Backlog has now largely normalized across our business with the exception of our APU products.  We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. ARR exceeded $1.4 billion in Q1. Storage and networking software and services are the fastest growth elements of ARR. Our software and services mix rose 400 basis points year-over-year to 69%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a differentiated value proposition in the market. Our Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 36.2%. It rose 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by a mix shift to Intelligent Edge and favorable input cost management. We are pleased that our non-GAAP gross margin is up 600 basis points from fiscal year '18 to a company record. This illustrates the ongoing pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue across our portfolio.  Given the current networking market dynamics, we are taking this moment to streamline and simplify our operations. We are focused on controlling the things we can control. Prudent cost management and disciplined execution are important regardless of the macro environment and are even more critical at times like these. The benefits of our focus are already evident in our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses, which declined 4.7% year-over-year at 9.5% sequentially to $1.7 billion. The strong Q1 non-GAAP gross margins and OpEx discipline led to Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of 11.5%, which is down only 30 basis points year-over-year despite less revenue scale.  Favorable timing on some corporate expenses was a tailwind to Q1 operating expense and will appear in Q2. GAAP EPS of $0.29 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.48 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range. Our diluted share count was approximately 1.3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude $251 million in costs primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and noncash loss on investments. As we manage the business with focus and discipline, we will also invest to capitalize on the sizable opportunities associated with moving through the interrelated inflection points in networking, hybrid cloud, and AI all at the same time. HPE is evolving into a more simple, more agile company that is even better positioned to pursue our growth opportunities and to evolve our mix of products, services and software and to drive structural higher profitability. Turning to our segment results. In addition to the new segments we discussed at SAM, we also created a new service segment that combines our prior compute and HPC and AI segment under one streamlined segment that offers solutions for our customers' training, tuning, and inferencing AI needs across the AI life cycle. Server revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter, which was down 23% year-over-year. This new segment had a difficult year-over-year compare as in Q1 '23, the business made significant progress against its backlog and benefit from HPE Cray EX revenue for Frontier. We are capturing the robust growth in AI demand. Our cumulative APU orders since Q1 '23, which include APU attached products and services in our HPE Cray EX XD and ProLiant Systems, rose approximately sequentially to now $4 billion. Our pipeline is robust and GPU supply, while still constrained, is improving.  Our APU product revenue increased sequentially to well over $400 million. We are now converting our APU orders into revenues, and yet very strong demand means our APU backlog is over $3 billion. Our pipeline is well above that. AI revenue in the quarter included our first revenues from AI cloud offering and from our HPE GreenLake win with a large hyperscale customer. Our traditional high-performance computing and supercomputing revenue fell seasonally, sequentially following a strong Q4.  Revenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue, given a structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 and rising input costs. General servers nearly doubled sequentially to 30% of the mix in Q1. Including HPE, Cray XD takes the mix of next-generation servers to 44%. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications.  We expect AI inferencing to gather momentum in fiscal year '24. As a reminder, our Gen11 services come with an attached subscription to our compute ops management software, which lifts our margin structure.  Our Q1 operating margin was 11.4%. While up sequentially, the margin was down 430 basis points year-over-year, given declining revenues. Intelligent Edge revenues were $1.2 billion or up 2% year-over-year. Demand for our campus switching and Wi-Fi products eased materially, particularly in Europe and Asia, and was the largest contributor to our Q1 revenue gap. We continue to see mid-single-digit growth benefits from our existing backlog but expect it to normalize going forward as we are now approaching our typical range. Our total channel inventory is within the normal range overall, inclusive of a pocket in the SMB business. We also continue to make progress in our new TAMs of data center networking, private 5G and SASE. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew well above 50% as we are benefiting from growing attach from our strong fiscal year '23 revenue growth.  We are pleased with our 29.4% operating margin, which was up 1,000 basis points year-over-year. The new hybrid cloud segment includes our storage businesses and now the HPE GreenLake portion of our server business. Revenues of $1.2 billion were down 10% year-over-year. Our traditional storage business was down year-over-year on difficult compares, given backlog consumption in Q1 '23. Total Electro subscription revenue grew over 100% year-over-year and is an illustration of our long-term transition to an as-a-service model across our businesses. We are starting to see AI server demand pull through interest in our file storage portfolio. We are also already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit. Our operating margin was 3.8%, which was down 200 basis points year-over-year. Lower revenues and a high mix of third-party product impacted margins in the traditional storage business. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year and financing volume was $1.4 billion. Our operating margin of 8.5% was up 130 basis points year-over-year. We are successfully passing through interest rate increases, and our asset management margins are returning to normal. Our Q1 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $64 million in cash flow from operations and consumed $482 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes cash in the first half of the year and generates cash in the second half. Our first quarter free cash flow benefited from some prepayments associated with pending HPE GreenLake deals at HPE Cray XD shipments.  Our cash conversion cycle was seven days, which is a reduction of eight days from Q1 '23. Our days payable and days of inventory were both higher, given the lower revenue and strong demand for APUs. We returned $172 million in capital to shareholders in Q1, primarily through our dividend. Before I discuss our outlook, let me first recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q2 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year '24. Given improving supply and the timing of installations, we expect segment revenue and therefore, corporate revenue to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. We expect the blended margin of the new segment to be flattish for the remainder of the fiscal year. For Intelligent Edge, we expect the market to remain soft throughout the year. Our cost reduction efforts will take time to show their benefits, which will result in margin pressure in Q2. Later in our fiscal year, we expect our normal channel inventory position and seasonal strength in the education market to be a modest revenue tailwind. We expect the full year margin to be in the mid-20% range.  For hybrid cloud, we expect sequential increases through the year as our traditional storage business improves and HPE GreenLake momentum continues. We expect meaningful progress through the year. With that context, let me turn to our outlook. For Q2, we expect revenues in the range of $6.6 billion to $7 billion or up slightly sequentially at the midpoint. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.20 and $0.25 and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.36 and $0.41. In part, given the higher prepayments in Q1, we expect negative free cash flow in Q2. Let me remind you that we have two drivers of potential lumpiness in our business. One is the timing and customer acceptances of large Cray wins, including Cray XD wins, which should ramp beginning in Q2. The second is the start of certain large HPE GreenLake deals. For some of these large deals, our segments recognize the related hardware on installation. In our consolidated results, we eliminate the segment revenue and recognize it over time. Both large deals and higher eliminations are indicators of our confidence in the second half of the fiscal year.  For fiscal year '24, we are revising our outlook, primarily given the current networking market headwinds. Let me remind you that we are excluding the H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results beginning in fiscal year '24. We now expect revised ranges for constant currency revenue and non-GAAP operating profit growth of zero to 2%. GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.81 to $1.91 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.82 to $1.92. The mix shift from Intelligent Edge to server should also weigh on our gross margins.  We now expect the full year non-GAAP gross margin to be slightly down from our prior full year expectation of 35%. We expect the impact of the cost actions we have initiated to materialize in the second half and leave fiscal year '24 OpEx to be flat to down from fiscal '23 OpEx. We expect our operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be $200 million to $250 million headwind versus our prior $300 million expectation, given better Q1 free cash flow and more favorable interest rate assumptions. We expect the effect on currency to be immaterial. We expect free cash flow to be at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by improvements in inventories as AI service shipments ramp. We reiterate our commitment to our dividend, which was raised 8% from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Debt repayment to maintain an investment-grade credit rating, and in long term, returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases. To conclude, we executed well in Q1 amidst a challenging market backdrop. We are pleased with our margin and EPS results while understanding our slower networking product demand and GPU availability and timing impacted our revenue performance. We have taken prompt action to further reduce our costs and continue to manage our expenses prudently while we advance our long-term strategy.  AI server demand is strong. Demand has stabilized for our traditional server and storage products, and our HPE GreenLake momentum is robust. We will continue to invest in IT inflections, networking, hybrid cloud and AI to drive our pivot to higher growth, higher margin revenue. I look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead, as does our new Chief Strategy Officer, Shannon Cross, who has joined us following a distinguished career as a Wall Street analyst and now has oversight of our IR function.  We will appreciate your input and questions along the way, and we can get started with that right now. I'll open it up now for your questions about the quarter. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Maybe on the GPU available -- GPU delays that you're seeing and far as acceptance. Just what are you seeing in terms of -- you identified that power and some of these things were conditions for what the delays were. But just what are you seeing in terms of how long those delays are going to take and how long the delays and the acceptances are going to be? Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Meta. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we had a couple of deals that slipped from Q1 into future quarters because customers are taking a little bit longer to prepare the data center space, getting the power and the cooling ready. And obviously, those deals will come as we complete those installations.  And then on the GPU side, obviously, we continue to experience a tight environment, although we are seeing some improvements. We have already a lot of GPUs that we already built but the customers will take time to accept those systems. But the reality is that we need more supply against the backlog that we announced today, which was $3 billion at the end of the Q1.  So that's what we see today. And as we go forward, we expect that improvement to happen, and that's why we are confident on the conversion of the GPU orders into revenue as we go along, not just because of the GPU availability but also the acceptances. Shannon Cross : Great, thank you very much, Meta. Gary, can we have the next question? Operator : And the next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Antonio, maybe just talk about, if I look at the revenue shortfall in Jan quarter, how much of that do you think is because your customers are pushing out their delivery schedules, they don't have power versus you just didn't have enough GPUs? If you were to think about those two buckets.  And then as you think about the full year guide, perhaps I didn't appreciate this, but can you just talk about what are you expecting for the networking segment, Intelligent Edge to do in the zero to 2% guide right now? Thank you. Marie Myers : Hey, Amit, good afternoon. Nice to hear from you. So I'll take -- I'll answer the first part of your question around the revenue. So in the first quarter with respect to what drove the $300 million on the revenue, it was mostly actually networking. We did have one deal that moved out. I think Antonio mentioned that in his prepared remarks. And then in terms of just how we're thinking about the second half of the guide, we are expecting a very strong second half, and that's predominantly driven actually by AI systems revenue. We are expecting networking to be slightly more favorable in the back half, but we really see the trough of networking in Q2, Amit. Shannon Cross : Great, Gary. Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question? Operator : And the next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could drill down a little bit in terms of understanding what's changed in the Intelligent Edge versus 90 days ago. And two elements are crossing my mind. One is really around the pending Juniper deal, whether that's influencing customers to maybe hold off purchases because of the uncertainties that might be affecting their decision-making as to what happens after you're combined. And the other part is just wondering if there's inventory that's been sitting in the channel, why didn't you know about it or why didn't you see it? Just trying to get an understanding of sort of what you've learned over these last 90 days. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thank you, Simon. So first of all, we saw an acceleration of the demand softness in the back -- at the end of the Q1, really in January, whether it's now people coming back, but obviously, the reality is we saw that as a headwind to our revenue in Q1. I have to say, we do not have a channel inventory problem. Actually, we are in great position, particularly from the enterprise customers and the enterprise product, we do not have that issue at this point in time. What we do see is customers are taking longer with the product we already shipped to them to install it and eventually go through the next cycle. And that's why we said with Marie, we're going to start seeing a slight improvement in the back half with Q2 being the trough. And part of the back half also is the traditional buying season in the United States with state and local education. The pipeline is very good. We have not lost one single deal that I can point to, neither because of the slowdown or customers deferring, not because of the announcement of the acquisition of Juniper. Marie Myers : And maybe, Simon, just to add to Antonio's comments, the only place where we saw a slightly elevated pocket of inventory was in SMB, which is a pretty small part of our business. Antonio Neri : Yeah. Shannon Cross : Thank you, Simon. Gary, can we have the next question? Operator : And the next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. Sorry, I just have one clarification and a question. Marie, on the [Indiscernible] that the backlog dropdown has contributed, I think, mid-single digits to the Intelligent Edge or something more broad than that? So can you just comment or clarify exactly what the backlog contribution was? And I suppose there's none going forward. And then just on my question, you sound pretty excited about sequential growth over the course of the year, both in servers and storage. Maybe you can just elaborate on why you see that. Is servers -- do you see sequential growth in traditional servers, non-accelerated [indiscernible]. Thank you. Marie Myers : Hi, Toni. So, good afternoon. So maybe I'll take the first part of the question, and I'll turn to Antonio for the second part. So look, in terms of the backlog, we really don't disclose the backlog on edge. But I think what we've said is that we've seen our backlog sort of revert back to normalized levels with the exception, obviously, of our APU or AI system. So that's how we're thinking about the backlog. I think in terms of just some context and commentary, you've seen in the industry that the market has definitely softened. And I think as Antonio said earlier, we saw that late in the quarter. So that's how we characterize the networking demand. And I would say that we do expect the trough in Q2 and to be slightly more favorable in the back half. So that's how we're thinking about the networking market playing out for the year.  I think I'll turn to Antonio to comment to servers. Antonio Neri : Yeah, Toni. Thank you for the question. So on the server and server side, obviously, we see signs of stabilization now, has been now a couple of quarters with sequential order improvement. But the reality is that, as we said in our opening remarks, we continue to see the mix shift in the traditional servers, as you call it, to Gen11. By the end of the year, we should be approximately 60% of the way there. Obviously, those services come with a different set of structural configurations and pricing, which obviously is higher. At the same time, we're going to see cost inflation. We believe that's going to be the case, and therefore, we have to eventually pass those as well. But the number of units have been very stable or slightly improving. And that's an important indicator because ultimately, that also drives our attach rate of our Operational Services, which in the quarter was very, very good. So that's why we are confident that sequential improvement from here on. And then on the storage side, obviously, AI is going to be a pull-through demand for us. We introduced a new offer now specifically for file. And remember that HP Electra continue to grow from here on. And a portion of that HP Electra revenue is also in the ARR because remember that software now is completely disaggregated from the solution itself, which means you have the CapEx portion of the revenue recognized in quarter and the subscription part of the software amortized over the period of the contract. So that's why ARR is growing because of the subscription in networking, which was up significantly, the storage and obviously, AI now also contributing to the ARR as well. Shannon Cross : Thank you, Toni. Gary, can we have the next question? Operator : The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the server market. Maybe two parts. I guess when we look at some of your peers, I mean, it seems to be that the lead times have improved on some of the GPUs, particularly the H100. I'd be curious of kind of like can you talk a little bit about what you've seen on lead times there in terms of your ability to deliver on some of this backlog? How that's changed over the course of this last quarter?  And then any thoughts on traditional server recovery? How do we think about the pace of that embedded in your expectations looking through this year? Antonio Neri : Yeah, sure. I think I covered the larger part of that question with Toni's question about sequential improvement in the traditional server, which is still very CPU-centric. On a combined server, right, now 25% of the total volume is APUs, which obviously GPU is the biggest portion of it. So we expect that sequential improvement driven by recovery in demand in units and then obviously, the shift to Gen11, which is important in this transition. On the GPU lead times, they have come down but it's still elevated. We're talking about 20-plus weeks at least lead time. And so -- and then it's going to be a combination of multiple type of GPUs, right, because there is still demand for the prior generation to H100. Obviously, the majority of the demand today is on H100. And going forward, we're going to have the Grace Hopper H200 and others, right, including MI 300x and the like. And the difference for us is that because we have a unique network in interconnect fabric, we can support all of them. So that's an important differentiation that I think everyone needs to remind because while a lot of the volume today is NVIDIA and then on the supercomputing, which is also an AI business, by the way, we support all three of them. And so that, for us, gives us the optionality to convert the orders that we have and future orders we see in the pipeline with a little bit more flexibility, I will say. Shannon Cross : Thank you, Aaron. Gary, can we have the next question? Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much. You said some of your demand in AI systems is coming in, we had GreenLake. Can you help us understand the linkage between your view of AI revenue and ARR growth? Antonio Neri : Yeah, Wamsi. I can start and Marie, feel free to add. I mean, the fact of the matter is that when you look at that $4 billion cumulative orders, a significant portion is going to go through the HPE GreenLake. If you recall last year, I announced that a hyperscaler placed an order with us, and that order is going through the GreenLake platform. And so that's why you see a breakdown over time of the AI GPU orders going through the ARR, which is fine. Ultimately, they give us the ability to attach other services, which is important to remember here, because remember, when it goes to the HPE GreenLake, in many cases, we are actually running those systems for the customer.  It's not just shipping the system to the customer. We actually put it in a location, whereas our data center footprint with our cooling and power, and then we attach our services, which are the run time plus other things we do. And why it's important also the growth in ARR because that drives margin expansion and accretion over time. So that's what's going on in addition to the fact that, obviously, now we crossed 31,000 customers on HPE GreenLake platform.  To put it in context, Wamsi, that's almost 3,000 customers in one quarter. I mean, 8% up quarter-over-quarter, 3,000 customers. And everything we do from the software perspective, it now is a subscription whether you sell HPE ProLiant Gen11, let's say, an AI-optimized server, the software to connect the server actually runs to GreenLake. Obviously, software runs through the GreenLake. A lot of the Aruba software, including Aruba Central, a subscription and now you have AI as well. Marie Myers : And maybe Wamsi, I'll just put a couple of numbers around the APU or the AI system orders that we saw, too. So we ended the quarter actually with $3 billion in backlog, so we really nearly tripled actually year-on-year. And in terms of just the link back to ARR, we shipped around $400 million in revenue but we had incremental revenue actually that went into ARR. And that sort of underscores the growth that we saw in ARR and expect to see going forward as well, Wamsi. Shannon Cross : Thank you, Wamsi. Gary, can we have the next question? Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess, Antonio, you referenced the increase in demand on AI that you see related to inferencing workloads on the enterprise side. Can you maybe talk a bit in terms of how these deployments are looking different to what you've been doing on the AI training side and maybe with some hyperscalers? And given the lead times, is this demand going to more materialize in relation to revenue more in fiscal '25 or is that just a fair estimate about, given the lead times? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah. No, thank you. That's an excellent question. Obviously, I spoke about the AI life cycle, training, tuning, and inferencing. Obviously, the training side has been more focused on the hyperscalers, so Tier 2, Tier 3 type of providers or companies that are funded well to build these large language models.  But when you look at enterprise, most of the enterprises are going to take a model and fine-tune it to give a context to the model with their data. And that, it can happen in multiple locations, right? It can happen in the data centers or potentially in a Coles or in some cases in the public cloud, but we see more focus on where they can control the data in a secure environment. And then the inferencing side, it can happen in a data center or in a public cloud once they are all trained but also at the edge. In fact, we showcase a lot of the inferencing cases at the edge in Mobile Congress at the edge of the network. Think about use cases like the Coles Supermarket, right? So there is a lot of data to the video footage captured in the stores. That video footage needs to be inferenced right there at that given moment with 0 latency in order to deliver the outcome. And there are in manufacturing and the like. And in fact, one of the use cases we saw also for inferencing is a large bank that now are doing some fine-tuning and inferencing to do risk management and other things. So we -- I will say we are kind of getting into it. I will say the growth will happen in the second half in '25. Definitely, the lead times will play a role. But I'm very encouraged about the momentum we see and the opportunity we have also with the combination of Juniper because most of these inferencing requires the network connectivity to deliver it. And that to me is one of the reasons why we went ahead with that acquisition. Shannon Cross : Thank you, Samik. Gary, can we have the next question? Operator : The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Just on the -- another one on the AI server side. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys are thinking about profitability for the businesses as we get more accelerated compute in your servers? And if you can also kind of break that down between maybe the Cray businesses and the standard compute? Is there going to be more of a margin gap in those two businesses when looking at more traditional going to accelerated? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure, I can start. I will say, listen, I think if you look at our server segment that we just published, we delivered very strong performance. I mean, we are in the target range we committed well back of 11% to 13%. And that -- the fact that we're bringing together give us the flexibility, opportunity to maximize the blended margin here as we go forward. To give a reference, when you sell an EX system, generally it's a liquid cool system that tends to gravitate to the supercomputing side or large AI clusters of thousands of GPUs. But an EX system supports today up to 80,000 GPUs in one system, and that's because of our interconnect fabric HPE Slingshot. In fact, some of those systems have 80,000 GPUs and maybe 40,000 CPUs in one system. But then you have other customers are many 2,000 or 4,000 GPUs. And depending on which location they pick, they need liquid cooling, we deploy those.  Now generally speaking, the XD platform, the Cray XD platform is the one that has the density and is more oriented and ability to mix much different configurations, and that's where the vast majority of the action is today in AI. And ProLiant Gen11 actually is more used for inferencing or in some areas of fine-tuning as well.  So we have the flexibility to meet all those demands with our unique IP. And on top of that, we actually lay our machine learning development environment. In fact, there are customers that come to us just for the MLDE environment. Later on, we pull the server. Now on AUPs, I will you that when you sell an XD, the can be 20 times the value of a traditional server with CPUs. And in EX, it can be up to 35 times. And so as we go forward, the ability to optimize margin through the configs and attach the services, whether it's our data center services plus the software and the Operational Services allows us to really drive the best outcome for our shareholders. Shannon Cross : Thank you, Tim. Gary, we'll take one final question. Operator : And that final question will come from Lou Miscioscia from Daiwa Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Louis Miscioscia : Hey, thank you for taking my question. Antonio, I guess the question I have is since you're talking a lot about data centers, I'm wondering what's going to happen is that the vast majority of x86 applications going to start to shift over to really be accelerated with GPUs due to the concern of more coming to end?  And what I'm asking is not really inference and it's not training. These are just normal applications, sort of like the same way architectures shifted from IBM mainframes or PA years and years ago to x86 eventually to that and cloud. Do you think that, that's going to shift over to running on GPUs? Antonio Neri : Well, thank you for the question. I think we need to understand there are two worlds that will coexist. There is the cloud-native world. Think about the cloud-native world where you have thousands and thousands of applications running on thousands and thousands of servers and they share everything. That architecture will exist for a long, long time because it's cost efficient. And the realization is that those applications world were designed for that type of environment, for the traditional monolithic approach to more a cloud-centric approach. And then you have these AI applications where you may have one application, only one, running on thousands and thousands of servers, which have accelerated compute. And it's a little bit far-fetched to say everything is going to move there. I argue that you will have inferencing solutions that a CPU will be just fine. Think about your phone, right? The phone will have, at some point, the ability to manage a large language model, let's say, 20 billion or 30 billion parameters, or the PC, maybe in the 80 billion to 100 billion parameters. But when you go up higher than that, obviously, you need potentially a server at the edge. And what I'll call 8-way GPU will be the right way to go.  So I argue there will be a mix in the transition here for a long period of time. Not everything will go to a GPU. It also depends how these large language models and all the AI applications get constructed. Now you asked us -- you made another interesting point which I want to make sure the -- all of you remember. We, as a company, have two now public instances of AI, power with renewal energies where we are supporting some of these customers, including a hyperscaler. And going forward, enterprise customers because they don't have the space and the cooling and the understanding how to run the system of scale.  That's a unique differentiation Hewlett Packard Enterprise have in addition to build systems and ship them. And I think that's an opportunity for us because that will drive stickiness to our HPE GreenLake platform, which obviously will drive recurring revenues but better attach software and services down the road. And Juniper will play a huge role in that environment. Shannon Cross : Thank you, Lou. Let me now turn it back to Antonio for concluding remarks. Antonio Neri : Well, thank you, Shannon. And thank you, everyone. I know you have been covering multiple calls today. I know it's late on the East Coast, but I will leave you with a few comments. Number one, we have the right strategy and the right team at the right time. This quarter, obviously, it was a little bit mixed because of the revenue. But remember, a lot of revenue also went through the ARR so we need to understand that implication going forward. I'm very confident about the future. And the moves we have made and continue to make, including the Juniper acquisition, will allow us to participate in this inflection point with a unique IP. Everybody, obviously, is focused about this AI momentum and the server side, but you need more than servers. AI will drive the need for more ports. That means you need more networking bandwidth. That's for sure. Also, let's not forget, we need to do this responsibly. One of the things I'm really proud about our company is the commitment to social responsibility. Doing all of this, addressing the sustainability and the ethical challenges and the responsibility around AI. But listen, just we came out two weeks ago where HP was ranked number one in the Just Capital, ranking something that when you are proud of it and I know shareholder value, all of that. We have to take some actions here. We are really focused on the strong execution and discipline, something we have shown now for six years plus. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m confident in the adjusted guidance we provided with Marie. And as we get into \u201825, obviously with the pending acquisition, I feel HPE will be even in a stronger position as we get through 2024. So thank you for your time and hope to connect with you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Gary, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Jeff Kvaal, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Jeff Kvaal : Good afternoon. Welcome to our Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and CEO, and Marie Myers, HPE's CFO. Let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes. We have posted the press release and the slide presentation accompanying the release on our investor relations web page. Elements of the financial information referenced on this call are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on the information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2024. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Please refer to HPE's SEC filings for a discussion of these risks. For financial information, we have expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. Please refer to the tables and slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. Throughout the call, all revenue growth rates are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency, unless otherwise noted. Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation in their prepared remarks. With that, Antonio. Antonio Neri : Good afternoon, And thank you for joining us today. HPE delivered a very solid performance in the second quarter, with revenue and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exceeding our outlook range, driven by AI systems revenue more than doubling from our first quarter. I am very optimistic about where we're headed. AI demand continues to accelerate with cumulative AI systems orders reaching $4.6 billion this quarter. We have a robust pipeline in this business, though large AI orders can cause fluctuations during the quarter. We anticipate continued revenue growth driven by increased AI systems demand, continued adoption of HPE GreenLake, and ongoing improvement in the traditional infrastructure market, including servers, storage, and networking. Due to our confidence in the second half of fiscal year 2024, we are raising our full-year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance and reiterating free cash flow guidance. Marie will provide more specifics in her remarks. While we focus on translating strong AI customer demand to revenue growth. We continue to drive cost discipline to operate more efficiently and to preserve the ability to make targeted investments, which will sustain our growth into the future. We are being prudent with our spending and reduce operating expenses in the first half, as compared to the prior year period. We're also driving business process simplification across the company, including through digitization and automation with AI. Demand for HPE's AI systems is accelerating at a faster pace, and our solid execution enabled us to more than double our AI systems' revenue sequentially to over $900 million, helped by supply chain conversion through improved GPU availability. Our lead time to deliver NVIDIA H100 solutions is now between six and 12 weeks, depending on order size and complexity. We expect this will provide a lift to our revenues in the second half of the year. Enterprise customer interest in AI is rapidly growing, and our sellers are seeing a higher level of engagement. Enterprise orders now comprise more than 15% of our cumulative AI systems orders, with the number of Enterprise AI customers nearly tripling year-over-year. As these engagements continue to progress from exploration and discovery phase, we anticipate additional acceleration in enterprise AI systems orders through the end of the fiscal year. sovereign states : HPE has decades of experience in the design, manufacture, and management of air and liquid cool systems, including the data center infrastructure to reliably deliver the highest levels of computing performance. Customers appreciate our AI at scale expertise and intellectual property, as well as unique liquid cooling manufacturing and services capabilities. As accelerated computing, silicon innovation advances, higher power density demands direct liquid cooling technologies. Building direct liquid cooling AI systems is complex and requires manufacturing expertise and infrastructure, including power, cooling, and water. With more than 300 HPE patents in direct liquid cooling, proven expertise and significant manufacturing capacity for this kind of systems, HPE is well-positioned to help customers meet the power demands for current and future accelerated compute silicon designs. Our leadership in AI was once again validated in May, when the latest top 500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers was released. HPE now has four of the top 10 world's fastest supercomputers, all of which are direct liquid cooled. Two of these systems are exascale supercomputers, with frontier still the world's fastest and [Aruba] (ph) now breaking the exascale barrier. I'm also proud that we have built seven of the world's top 10 energy efficient systems, according to the latest Green 500 list. This experience makes us an attractive partner to sovereign states and government pursuing AI strategies. HPE benefits from a strong ecosystem of AI partners, including NVIDIA. We introduced co-engineered enterprise solutions with NVIDIA last year to streamline the model development process, as well as to enable enterprises to fine-tune large language models with their private data to accelerate inferencing. I'm excited that NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang will Join me at HPE Discover Las Vegas in just two weeks. Together, we will unveil new, exciting, and differentiated innovations that will simplify and accelerate enterprise AI adoption and deployment. Enterprise customers are already responding to our unique AI portfolio. For example, [QBox] (ph), a facial and image recognition company in Korea, is developing new generative AI models using HPE AI systems to enhance identity verifications at locations such as the Incheon International Airport in South Korea. JT Group, based in Japan, operates a pharmaceutical business and is planning to use our HPE AI systems to support AI model training and simulations to accelerate drug discovery. And we just announced that we will power Scaleway\u2019s AI cloud service offering using our HPE AI systems. The new service will make powerful computing accessible to companies to support their various AI workloads and use cases. As we capitalize on the AI growth opportunity, we also see indications of the market recovery in traditional and cloud infrastructure markets, orders for traditional service grew sequentially, and year-over-year, driven by enterprise public sector and SMB customers in North America and Europe. We are seeing no indication of cannibalization from accelerated computing demand. And revenue grew sequentially as customers transitioned to higher AUP HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers. Differentiated customer-centric innovation positions as well to capture this market recovery. For example, our leading HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud is attracting new customers. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the number of customer organizations using HPE GreenLake increased sequentially by almost 9% to 34,000. And our as-a-service lifetime total contract value grew to more than $15 billion in Q2, with our annualized revenue run rate, or ARR growing 39% year-over-year. Demand is increasing for our HPE GreenLake on-premise private cloud solutions. The Defense Information Systems Agency, a combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense, selected HPE to develop a distributed hybrid multi-cloud platform prototype on HPE GreenLake, as part of an effort to simplify the organization's management of disparate IT infrastructure and resources across public and private clouds. In storage, we accelerated the transition of our portfolio in Q2 to meet the needs of hybrid cloud and AI. Several weeks ago, HPE introduced significant new functionality to our HPE Alletra storage offerings. We rounded out our block offering by extending the hybrid capabilities of HPE Alletra block storage to AWS, doubling its capacity to address more customers and enhancing its automation capabilities with generative AI. Early this quarter, we introduced new HPE GreenLake for file storage capabilities with options specifically targeting the unstructured data demands of AI. We have also added significant specialist sales capacity in recent months. While it takes time to activate new sellers and bring them to full productivity in a market with long sell cycles. We expect increased order-to-revenue conversion in the future. The enhancement to our winning portfolio complemented by a more focused sales force positioned HPE to strengthen the already robust customer adoption of HPE Alletra. More than 1,000 new HPE Alletra MP systems have been deployed to date, which is the fastest product ramp in the history of our company. In networking, the market remained in transition during the quarter, as customers continued to work through their current inventory. As demand in this segment gradually returns, we believe our broad portfolio positions as well. We expect modest sequential networking demand improvement driven by the state and local purchasing season in the United States. We announced significant new innovations during the quarter to align with HPE's broader AI strategy. These solutions include Generated AI capabilities to improve AI Ops and WiFi 7 access points that capture edge data for AI inferencing. In addition, last month we launched new security and AI observability tools to help fight AI cyber risks. And just yesterday, we expanded the most complete private 5G and Wi-Fi portfolio in the market with the launch of HPE Aruba Networking Enterprise Private 5G. All of this will be delivered through our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers are responding to our networking innovation. In the last few months, customers ranging from Houston Airport to [Baptist] (ph) Health Group to Mercedes-Benz Stadium to the University of Maryland have turned to HPE to enhance the experience for the visitors, residents, and employees. As we look to our future in networking, we continue to be very enthusiastic about the proposed acquisition of Juniper networks. We're currently in the regulatory process for this transaction and expect to close by the end of 2024 or early 2025. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in innovation while we drive operational and cost discipline to continue to improve our cost structure. We are focused on reducing complexity in our business processes, as well as implementing automation and AI across the company to enhance customer service, R&D productivity, and team member overall experience. I also want to note that we recently announced we have restructured the sale of our stake in H3C. Since the transaction is large and complex, the required regulatory approvals were taken longer than previously anticipated. So, we agreed to restructure the sale with units. The updated agreement provides HPE with the opportunity to sell a significant portion of the shares in the coming months. The new payment structure has no impact on the pending Juniper Networks transaction, as the structure of the deal financing does not rely on any of the H3C proceeds. Finally, you likely saw that we announced in May that we have agreed to divest our communications technology group to enhance our strategic focus in high growth, high margin parts of the market, including the service provider and enterprise markets. In closing, I want to reiterate that I'm proud of the very solid performance in Q2. It shows the alignment of our strategy and innovation to major market opportunities. We have greater optimism about the second half of the year, leading us to raise our full year revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. AI is creating growing demand across our portfolio, and we see significant opportunities across customer and business segments. Our competitive advantages, from deep expertise in standing up AI systems to our differentiated HPE GreenLake Cloud to our networking storage offerings position as well. We have an excellent team, and I'm confident in our ability to continue executing with discipline to take advantage of incredible opportunities presented by this era of innovation. I am looking forward to sharing with you our latest breakthrough innovation and partnerships across AI, hybrid cloud and networking later this month at HPE Discover Las Vegas. We are very excited to be the first corporate keynote at Sphere, and I hope to see many of you there. I would like now to hand it over to Marie, who will talk about the details of our segments and our outlook. Marie, over to you. Marie Myers : Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with all of you after my first full quarter as HPE's CFO. Over the past three months, I have become even more excited about our opportunities across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking. We remain in the very early days of AI, yet it is already driving strong interest, pipeline, orders, and revenue across our portfolio from service to storage to services to financing. Our AI system revenue inflected positively in Q2. We are winning deals in the AI market now and are well positioned for additional demand from enterprises and software into the future. Our differentiation includes decades of liquid cooling expertise, which we expect to become even more in demand with future iterations of chips, including NVIDIAs. In short, we see AI as a long-term driver of our financial results and as a pillar of our strategy to pursue higher growth, higher margin revenues. We are very pleased that we have exceeded our expectations in Q2 across key metrics. We exceeded the midpoint of our revenue guidance by $400 million. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS was above the high end of our range, and free cash flow exceeded $600 million. Improving Enterprise demand for traditional servers on top of the expected sharp ramp in AI servers drove the outperformance. Our AI orders, a healthy, intelligent edge, is set to grow sequentially beyond Q2 as expected, and AI emerged as a driver of a healthy HPE GreenLake momentum. We are seeing rapid growth in AI system revenue. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance in Q2 and am excited about our continued progress through Fiscal 2024. Let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency to $7.2 billion. This exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance by approximately $400 million. We have strong momentum in HPE GreenLake. The number of customers that have adopted HPE GreenLake rose 9% sequentially. ARR grew 39% year-over-year to above $1.5 billion in Q2. Storage and networking are typically the fastest growth elements of ARR and both retain robust growth rates. This quarter, AI was the fastest growth component of ARR. Our software and services mix rose approximately 200 basis points year-over-year to 67%. ARR is the best indicator of our model transformation to our as-a-service offerings. This growth validates what our customers are telling us, that HPE GreenLake is a key differentiator. We expect HPE GreenLake's value proposition to key customers, including enterprises and sovereigns, to sharpen with the advent of AI. Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 33.1%, which was down 310 basis points sequentially and year-over-year, driven by a mix shift from our higher margin Intelligent Edge revenue to Server revenue, plus an unfavorable mix within hybrid cloud. At Q2, non-GAAP operating expenses fell 1.6% year-over-year, despite our revenue growth of 4%. Our OpEx discipline partially offset lower non-GAAP gross margins and held the non-GAAP operating margin decline to 200 basis points sequentially and year-over-year to 9.5%. The OpEx discipline plus higher revenue drove GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.24 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.42. The latter exceeded the high end of the guidance range on strong revenue and cost discipline. And non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes $247 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisitions, and other related challenges. We are managing the business with focus and discipline and evolving into a simpler, more agile company. We are also investing to capitalize on growth from the interrelated inflection points of AI, hybrid cloud, and networking and to drive structurally higher profitability over time. Let's turn to our segment results. Server revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter. This was up 16% sequentially and up 18% year-over-year. Strengths in both AI systems and traditional servers drove the healthy revenue growth. Our cumulative AI system product and service orders since Q1 2023, rose approximately $600 million sequentially to $4.6 billion. I am very pleased with our AI system product revenue more than doubled sequentially to over $900 million. This strong revenue growth allowed us to make progress against our backlog, which is now $3.1 billion. Given the growing importance of our services business, we have updated our AI disclosures for this quarter to include services. Services is a small portion of our AI systems metrics at present, though we expect it to become more meaningful over time. Our differentiation with liquid cooling, software, HPE GreenLake and increasingly, services is resonating in the market. We have seen a threefold increase in our enterprise AI customer base in the past year. Revenue from our traditional server business increased sequentially. We expect this trend to continue. Demand is improving, as enterprises digest prior purchases and gain more comfort with the macro outlook. Structural mix shift to higher AUP Gen11 servers is ahead of our expectations, and we are able to pass-through rising input costs. We are encouraged that our Gen11 pipeline is starting to include AI inferencing activity and enterprise applications, and we see more evidence of adoption in the enterprise in Q2. Our Q2 operating margin was 11%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially and was in-line with the expectations we laid out last quarter for our operating margins [near] (ph) the lower-end of our long-term 11% to 13% range. While pricing remains aggressive in the server market, particularly in AI systems, we remain disciplined in cost and price, as we pursue profitable growth. Hybrid cloud revenues of $1.3 billion were up 1% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year. We are already seeing some cross-selling benefits of integrating the majority of our HPE GreenLake offering into a single business unit. I mentioned a 39% growth in ARR this quarter. Our traditional storage business was down year-over-year. The business is managing two long-term transitions at once. We talked about our migration to the more software-intensive Alletra platform. This is reducing current period revenue growth, so locking in future recurring revenue. Storage ARR growth of over 50% year-over-year offers early confidence into the migration. The second transition is from block storage to file storage driven by AI. While early, this is also on the right trajectory. Our new file offerings plus the sales force investment Antonio mentioned tripled our pipeline of file storage deals sequentially in Q2. Our operating margin was 0.8%, which was down 300 basis points sequentially and 110 basis points year-over-year. Reduced revenue scale and an unfavorable mix of third-party products and traditional storage was the largest driver of the sequential change. Intelligent Edge revenues were $1.1 billion. Revenues fell 9% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. Backlog consumption created difficult compares with both prior periods. Our backlog is now at normal levels. The demand environment remains soft and large enterprises have yet to return to the market in force. However, we do see some green shoots that give us confidence in networking will transition to modest sequential growth beyond Q2, as we had expected. Our channel inventory remains within the normal range. Wi-Fi has grown sequentially for two consecutive quarters. Growth remains strong in software and services. Attach rates and renewals for Aruba Central, SASE and our AIOps software remains strong. The Intelligent Edge portfolio of subscription revenue grew above 50% year-over-year. The segment operating margin of 21.8% was down 760 basis points sequentially and 290 basis points year-over-year. As expected, the lower revenues, reduced mix of switching business and the less revenue from backlog were the primary drivers. As we indicated last quarter, we have reset our OpEx plan for the year to account for lower revenue and expect the Intelligent Edge, operating margin to be back in the mid-20% range by Q4. Our HPE Financial Services revenue was up 1% year-over-year, and financing volume was $1.7 billion. Our operating margin of 9.3% was up 80 basis points sequentially and 40 basis points year-over-year. Our Q2 loss ratio remained steady below 0.5%. These results are what we have come to expect from this high-quality, predictable business. However, underneath these steady results, FS is already adapting to drive AI growth across the business. Year-to-date, nearly $0.5 billion of our $3 billion in financing volume went to AI wins with both cloud and enterprise customers. This illustrates our prior point that AI is driving demand to every one of our businesses. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operations and $610 million in free cash flow this quarter. HPE typically consumes significant amount of cash in the first half of the year and then generates cash in the second half. We are ahead of traditional free cash flow patterns thus far in fiscal 2024, given higher than expected net income in Q2, prepayments for AI systems, and timing of working capital payments. Our cash conversion cycle was negative four days, which is a reduction of 28 days from Q2 '23. Our days of inventory and days payable were both higher to support our expected growth in AI system revenue in the second half. We returned $240 million in capital to shareholders in Q2, including $169 million in dividends and $45 million in share repurchases. Our year-to-date capital return is $386 million. Let's turn now to our forward view. We expect a materially stronger second half led by AI systems, traditional servers, and storage, networking and HPE GreenLake. Let me recap the key drivers that factor into our expectations for Q3 and the full year. For server, we expect improving GPU supply for AI systems and improving demand for traditional servers to drive sequential revenue increases through fiscal year 2024. While the rising AI systems mix is a gross margin headwind, we are balancing this with higher-margin services revenue, improving scale and cost discipline. We expect the segment operating margin to be approximately 11% for the fiscal year. For hybrid cloud, we expect slight sequential revenue increases throughout the year. HPE GreenLake growth should continue and traditional storage should improve slightly. We expect operating margin to improve modestly to the mid-single-digit range through the year as HPE GreenLake deals mature, new products ramp, and our sales force optimization gathers momentum. For Intelligent Edge, we anticipate a slight sequential growth in Q3 and Q4, driven primarily by seasonal education spending rather than improving markets. We continue to expect our cost reduction efforts to materialize in the second half and our full year operating margin to be in the mid-20% range. With that context, let me now turn to our outlook. For Q3, we expect revenues in the range of $7.4 billion to $7.8 billion. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.29 and $0.34, and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.43 and $0.48. For fiscal year 2024, we now expect constant currency revenue growth of 1% to 3%, which is up from our prior 0% to 2% range. We reiterate our non-GAAP operating profit growth guidance of 0% to 2%. We are reducing our GAAP diluted net EPS guidance by $0.20 to $1.61 to $1.71 to incorporate the recent updates to our H3C proceeds. We are raising our non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance up $0.03 to $1.85 to $1.95. This incremental $0.03 or $0.06 annualized reflects the contribution from the retained portion of our H3C stake. We are also increasingly comfortable with the high-end of the non-GAAP diluted net EPS range, given our OI&E and operational improvement. We are excluding from our non-GAAP results the gain on sale from our H3C and CTG divestments. This year's mix shift from networking to AI systems should weigh on our gross margins. We expect the fiscal '24 non-GAAP gross margin to be below our full year expectation of 35% from our Analyst Day. To balance the mix shift, we are driving further simplicity and efficiency across the business. We are accelerating our generative AI capabilities such as implementing HPE-specific large language models and chatbots for our sales and service representatives. As I mentioned last quarter, prudent cost management, simplified processes, and disciplined execution across cycles are key tenets of our long-term journey towards higher margins. These cost actions will be evident in financial results in the second half of fiscal '24. We now expect fiscal year '24 OpEx to be down modestly from fiscal '23 OpEx. Our prior view was flat to down. This includes a sequential increase in Q3 for marketing before a sequentially lower Q4, which will serve us well heading into fiscal '25. We expect our fiscal '24 operating margin to be flattish year-over-year. We now expect OI&E to be less of a headwind this year. We anticipate $150 million headwind versus our prior expectation of a $200 million to $250 million headwind, given a one-time benefit in Q2 and the retained portion of our H3C stake. We expect the effect of currency to be immaterial. Our strong first half free cash flow increases our confidence that we will deliver at least $1.9 billion in fiscal year '24. We expect significantly stronger free cash flow in the second half of the year led by higher earnings, given our ramp in AI systems. This does not include the $2.1 billion that we expect to receive from Unisplendour this fiscal year, as a result of our recently restructured agreement to sell our stake in H3C. We expect working capital to be neutral to free cash flow as we expect declines in inventory to balance declines in accounts payable. We remain committed in the long-term to our balanced capital allocation framework, including our target of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. In the near term, we expect to continue share repurchases at a pace in line with Q2 as we prudently manage our balance sheet, ahead of the anticipated receipt of the H3C proceeds and the Juniper transaction closing. The proposed Juniper deal remains on track to close in late 2024 or early '25 as planned. We remain committed to our dividend and to our investment grade rating. To conclude, our solid Q2 results illustrate how comprehensively AI is affecting our portfolio. We are capturing profitable growth opportunities in the AI market. We are excited to discover and look forward to seeing many of you at our IR Summit. I'll open it up now for your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. And congrats on a nice sprint. I guess my question is really on the AI system side. You folks obviously had some really good revenue performance here. I think business pretty much doubled sequentially. I'm hoping you could spend some time talking about how should we think about margins on the AI side versus maybe segment averages because your margins appear to be holding up a lot better versus they have done at Dell or Super Micro, for example. So I'd love to just understand how do we think about AI system margins versus corporate averages? And if you just touch on what do you think differentiates your AI solutions versus companies like Super Micro, Dell, that'll be super helpful. Thank you. Marie Myers : Hi Amit, good afternoon. it's Marie, and happy to take the question. And look, obviously, we shipped $900 million of AI revenue in the quarter. And I think as you saw, our margin rate on our service segment from an operating profit perspective was 11%. So look, honestly as the CFO, very pleased that's what we guided and that's what we achieved, and that's what we've guided for the second half of the year. In terms of what's the puts and takes and the headwinds and tailwinds, let me give you some color around it. So from a headwind perspective, obviously we're dealing with a tougher inflationary commodity market, particularly even in the second half. And we also see, as you saw in the quarter, a greater mix of AI servers actually in our overall server mix. And as you know and you've heard, it's a pretty competitive market out there I might add, too. But clearly, we're managing it very well. And I'd say what's benefiting us is a couple of really important tailwinds. One is what we are seeing in terms of the Gen11 transition. That part of the business brings a higher AUP. And then also frankly, Amit it's the work we're doing around cost. So as a result, I think this really illustrates that we are very disciplined around both price and cost and frankly, it's part of our strategy to drive profitable growth. So pleased with the results, and that's how we are guiding the back half of the year, Amit. Antonio Neri : So Amit, on the differentiation, I will summarize this on four key elements. One is our ability to deliver and run systems at scale, so AI system scale, that's a unique expertise and we have decades of experience. Number two is our infrastructure cooling intellectual property. We actually have all the IP necessary to cool systems in three different ways for them other. Our manufacturing footprint, which is very unique. We have one of the largest water-cooled manufacturing footprints in the world with two very important locations in the US and in Europe, which are close to customers. And then last but not least is services. What I think people are coming to realize that running the system of scale requires unique services capabilities. And that's why with Marie, we started showing you what the services pull-through is, which is also over time, a lever to improve the gross margin in this business. And we cover all aspects from day zero which consulting, to day one, which is advisory and professional services design and then -- and build, and then day 2, which is a running part with our -- in our operational services side and deep expertise when it comes down to this system of scale, including direct liquid cooling. All those four key elements are a big differentiation for us. Jeff Kvaal : Thank you Amit. We move to the next question. Operator : And the next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess sticking on the AI topic, if I could first ask, when you referenced the AI enterprise customers starting to show up, and I think the comment on the conference call was, it's now north of 15% of your AI orders. Can you give a little bit of more context of that? What has that been over the last couple of quarters? I'm just trying to think about the trajectory of that. And then Antonio, on the liquid cooling side, as we and investors think about Blackwell product cycle from NVIDIA, I'm curious of, can you be a little bit more specific of exactly where, from a technology perspective, you differentiate at liquid cooling? Is there something unique that HPE does within the 300 patents that you would want to highlight for us, as sustainably differentiated. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Aaron. I think it's fair to say that the enterprise demand has started to pick in Q1 and really accelerate in Q2. Early on, if you go back to the Q1 2023 all the way to, call it, calendar 2023, a lot of demand came from the model builders, the service providers, and hyperscalers and you see the reference to our partner, Microsoft. But as I think about that, I think three segments of the market. I think about [dark segment] (ph), which is driving a lot of demand for a lot of GPUs and accelerated compute in general. The second segment is sovereign clouds and that starts to pick up now. And that's, think about tens of customers around the globe because obviously, our countries. And then there is enterprise customers, which will be thousands of customers over time. So today, we are very pleased with the momentum in enterprise AI. A lot of the conversations are happening. I was in Europe the last two weeks and I was in London, I was in Paris, I was in Madrid. All of them want to adopt AI. And I think they are attracted to HPE because of the trust, the quality, and the ability to deliver a simplified experience to our HPE GreenLake platform. As for the differentiation, HPE has three different ways to cool systems. So one is the traditional way, which is called the liquid-to-air cooler, think about that, basically running water supply in chilled locations where basically cools the air around the systems. Everybody has done that for a long time. The second is what most of the industry is doing today, which is what I call 70% direct liquid cooling or hybrid liquid cooling. Those companies still use fans to cool aspects of the systems. Some of our competitors talk about direct liquid cooling, but that's exactly what they're doing, and they are doing only a hybrid direct liquid cooling. And HPE has -- and by the way, in that environment, we have 10 systems already in market today that we are shipping and configuring for customers. And then we have what I call 100% direct liquid cooling. And this is a unique differentiation HPE has because we have been doing 100% direct liquid cooling for a long time. And today, there are six systems in deployment, and three of them are for generative AI. And as we go to the next generation of the silicon and you talk about Blackwell, when you go to the B200, that will require 100% direct liquid cooling. And that's a unique opportunity for us because you need not only the IP and the capabilities to cool the infrastructure but also the manufacturing side. And that's why I said early on to the previous call, that HPE has one of the largest water-cooled manufacturing capabilities. So that is what really differentiate us. And even on the hybrid way to cool the system, HPE is not using off-the-shelf solution. We use what we call an ARC, which stands for adaptive rack cooling system, is a unique design. And the good news is that we can actually colocate in the same data center and in the same aisle, direct liquid cooling and air-cooled systems, which is unique because customers don't want to retrofit data center. So that's the opportunity. Jeff Kvaal : Aaron, thank you very much, Gary. Operator : The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mary Lenox : Hi, this is Mary on for Meta. I just had a question for you on Intelligent Edge. Where are you in the Intelligent Edge inventory digestion and when do you expect to emerge from it? Marie Myers : Yes. Good afternoon. And in terms of where we're at Intelligent Edge, I think as I commented in my prepared remarks, we saw Q2 as being the trough period, and we've been transitioning through that throughout the quarter. And if you look at the market and where it's at right now, I'd say, that our channel inventory right now is in really good shape. And we did mention in the guide that we do expect a modest sequential improvement in networking in the back-half of the year. Antonio Neri : Yes. And I will say in addition to what Marie said, what I'm really excited is that we see interesting areas of growth happening now. If you go back to Mobile World Congress and you see even announcements like we made yesterday, the enterprise private 5G is picking up significant momentum. Of my almost 40 meetings I had in Barcelona, more than half were about enterprise private 5G. And so yesterday, we announced the most complete enterprise private 5G on the back of the Athonet acquisition. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much Mary, Gary. Operator : The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on the guidance. You talked about enthusiasm for the second half, but you beat revenues this quarter relative to your expectations by $400 million and by guiding up an additional percent, you're actually only guiding up the full year by $300 million. So I'm wondering, are you just being conservative, given the commentary around enthusiasm and forces at work in the second half or how do we reconcile that discrepancy? And then also just on AI servers for the second half, I think you talked about six-week to 12-week lead times. So if you have $3 billion in backlog and lead times for six weeks to 12 weeks, why can't you deliver $3 billion in AI systems like next quarter or certainly in the second half? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes. Hi Toni, good afternoon. So this is Marie. I'm going to take the first question just on the guide. So let me just clarify the guidance in terms of how we put it together. So we raised the guide from -- to $1.85 to $1.95, and that actually was the pass-through on that 19% stake in H3C. So we actually put $0.03 related to the 19% stake. What I did point to though, Toni, is I pointed to the higher end of the range, so that's really what's giving us confidence based on the increase that we made on revenue. So you're seeing that higher top-line and then also the confidence I got around just the cost discipline. So you've seen that just in the last couple of quarters where we've had a really strong scrutiny and focus around OpEx. And plus we did have some favorability in OI&E this quarter, that [beats] (ph) \u2013 that was actually just a onetime. So I just want to make that point of clarification. So overall, Toni, keeping the guide at $1.85 to $1.95 but really pointing to the higher end of the guide in terms of just the confidence that you articulated. So I'll turn it over to Antonio to cover the second question. Antonio Neri : Yes. Toni, I think there is an opportunity to potentially exceed that. I think the limiting factor is not the supply, to be honest with you, is the availability of data center space. I made this comment in Q1, if you recall, data center space and power and cooling. And so some -- we are working with the customers to time everything correctly, six to 12 weeks, think about it, maybe less than a quarter, but then you have to go and install it. And there is a nice percentage of our deals in generative AI, which are all actually GreenLake. And so while we can recognize the revenue upfront, we are deferring all the services piece of it. So it really is going to come down to the timing of the data center and the power and cooling. And if that all aligns correctly, then we may have an opportunity to do better. But we felt prudent at this point in time to keep it the way it is and raising by 1%. Jeff Kvaal : Toni, thanks very much, Gary. Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Joseph Cardoso : Hi, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So maybe just following up on the AI questions. You're seeing a sequential decline in AI backlog this quarter, admittedly off of a very robust revenue quarter. But maybe you can just discuss the pipeline you're seeing. And sitting here, like what are some of the puts and takes that investors should be considering when seeing the sequential decline in backlog despite what appears to be a strong underlying demand environment overall? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Sure. Thank you. Yes, our backlog was slightly down quarter-over-quarter, also was based on the demand we took in and also the fact that we converted more. I think you have to realize some of these deals, particularly larger deals take time and a little bit lump. Some of them have to go through the financing side. And so we feel good about where we are today. But in terms of the pipeline, think about multiples of the current backlog, multiples of the current backlog. So as we go through the next weeks and quarters here, we feel very confident in our ability to capture that AI for all the reasons I described before, and also the ability to close these deals as some of them may include, by the way, the need to provide data center space as well because we are not just building the system. And these are all generative AI systems, by the way, all of them that we also need to run it for customers. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much Joe, Gary. Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Victor Chiu : This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. The doubling the AI system's revenue is a pretty sharp inflection this quarter. Can you just tell us how much of the increase was driven by allocation improvement versus ability to ship orders? And kind of just help us understand the dynamic there a little bit. Antonio Neri : No, I don't think it has to do anything with location. I read all this thing about location. We have a fantastic partnership with NVIDIA is about lead times in the general H100, which obviously NVIDIA made significant improvements on their own. And then obviously, as we start ramping our manufacturing processes, we actually become better and better at the revenue conversion. And I would say, I want to thank my team because my team did a fantastic job and we feel good about as we go forward. So it's a combination of multiple things, better lead times on supply. We feel pretty good about the ability to deliver systems 6 to 12 weeks to Toni's question, and some of them are straightforward is just shipments and some are with our HPE GreenLake offering wrapped around. Jeff Kvaal : Thanks very much Victor, Gary. Operator : The next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Hi, thanks for taking questions. It's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. Can you talk about how much of the GreenLake revenue and ARR growth came from AI? And then Antonio, do you think that having GreenLake is helping you sell AI systems? And I also wanted to clarify, Antonio, you talked about sovereign AI. Can you talk about what innings you're in? And are there specific requirements of sovereign AI where you think HPE is well positioned to satisfy? Marie Myers : Hi Ruplu, we look forward to seeing you tomorrow. So in terms of your question around just ARR and AI, actually, it was the fastest growth element of ARR in Q2, followed by storage and networking. So I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are starting to see AI to sort of move through our entire portfolio. So pleased with the progress that we had this quarter, and I'll turn it over to Antonio to add some more context. Antonio Neri : Yes. On the second part of the question, I think we are early at this point in time. I think there is more to be seen. And I want to make sure I captured exactly what you said. Can you repeat the last part because you were a little bit breaking. Ruplu Bhattacharya : Yes, I just wanted to ask about sovereign AI. What innings are you in, and are there specific requirements that you can satisfy? Antonio Neri : Yes. So on sovereign AI, I said it's early, early on. I think there is a lot of engagements right now happening at the country level. The good news, we have very good reach across the board. And it's a combination of both. There is a combination of providing what I call generative AI locations where customers, enterprise customers can get access to -- to a sovereign cloud that the government may be helping funding at the same time. And the other one is what I call supercomputing power, right, itself. And so the two are very well aligned to the sovereign AI opportunities. And that's why I'm excited because HPE already provides to a lot of the sovereign governments supercomputing. So now we can extend into generative AI. If you think about the example of the UK Bristol is a generative AI system that the UK is funding as a part of the Bristol University, that the venture is going to be open to start-ups and enterprises in the UK, to either train models or do other type of research. And that's what we see. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thanks very much Ruplu. Gary, we have two more questions, please. Operator : And the next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hi, good afternoon guys. Really appreciate, taking the question. Just a quick clarification and a quick question, Antonio. Did you say that in the last 12 months, AI growth was driven by service providers? And was it mobile, you said? And then the question is, what's a good way to think about cloud, your gen AI cloud scale opportunity, hyperscalers and Tier 2s going forward? Thanks a lot. Antonio Neri : Yes. No, thank you. I said that the segment where we have seen, obviously the vast majority of action and demand is the model builders. Those are the big companies that build large and small language models. Obviously, you saw our comments about our partner with Microsoft and the extension of their capacity to OpenAI. That's an example of a model builder. But also there are other service providers. And in fact, in my remarks, I mentioned Scaleway, which is a French service provider that provides the capacity for the local French model builders. In fact, there is a lot -- there is a very vibrant ecosystem in France about building AI models that will use that capacity to train the models. That's what I referred to at this point in time. And that's what we see and that's what we've seen. So we are very interested in not just the model builders but Tier 2, Tier 3, which also is going to be a big driver. But understanding that enterprise, ultimately what the action is going to happen in terms of fine-tuning and deploying these AI models over time. Jeff Kvaal : Okay. Thank you very much Ananda. And last question, Gary. Operator : And the last question is from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa. Please go ahead. Louis Miscioscia : So thanks for getting me in. my question is really about GPU or accelerated diversification. Obviously, AMD and Intel and others are starting to come out. So as you think about calendar 2024, when do you think that your system will be for this? And what do you think demand will be and then maybe continue that into 2025? Antonio Neri : Yes. I mean, listen, I'm very pragmatic about these things. Today, in generative AI, the market leader is NVIDIA. And that's where we have aligned our strategy, that's where we have aligned our offerings. And as I made my remarks earlier, we have 10 systems already in the mixed cooling environment and six systems or six offers also in the direct liquid cooling environment. So we are aligning with NVIDIA today, and that's why you are going to see at Discover, Jensen coming on stage with me to talk about what we're doing together. Now when you go into the sovereign space where there may be some components of supercomputing down the road, obviously, they designed their own systems with our help, and that will be a mixed environment. But just in the last month or so, we opened a new system in the Los Alamos laboratory, which was actually an NVIDIA system with HPE and is direct liquid cooled, so we are clear about that. But then there are also systems that will come in 2025 that may have different type of accelerators. Over time, we are going to be time to market. But right now, we have aligned to NVIDIA and that's what we're doing. And that's why I think it will be a great opportunity for you to join us at HPE Discover because you can see everything we talked today on the floor. Every system I just referred to my slides, every comment I made in my answers to the questions, you can come and see it. These are systems and IP that we are shipping today and you're going to see our time to market with this silicon in addition to all the services in HPE GreenLake. So it's going to be an amazing opportunity also because we are doing the keynote at Sphere, we're going to have probably inside, The Sphere more than 17,000 customers and partners joining us. So I know we don't have a lot of -- the normal time for questions, but I will say thank you for joining today. As a recap, the quarter was very solid. Our AI system revenue more than doubled to $900 million, allowing us to obviously exceed our revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Because the demand in AI is strong, we have a multiple of -- in the backlog, in our pipeline and some aspects of the traditional infrastructure market is recovering, plus our disciplined execution on pricing and cost, we are raising both the revenue and EPS guidance. And on the revenue, there could be something more obviously, but it's depending on some of the timing. And then obviously on the EPS, we are comfortable with the higher end of the range, as Marie said. So again, we are very pleased. We feel the second half is going to set up really well. And then obviously, we are looking forward to see many of you at HPE Discover in just less than two weeks. Thank you for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation in their prepared remarks. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thank you, Paul, and welcome to your new role leading investor relations at HPE. And thank you, all, for joining us today. HPE delivered a strong third quarter performance. We generated impressive revenue growth with notable acceleration of AI systems revenue conversion, as well as higher operating margin from the prior quarter. Net revenue was $7.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share rose $0.01 from a year ago to $0.50 in Q3, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. We generated a free cash flow of more than $660 million, and will pay a dividend of $0.30 per share. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. Marie will provide further details in her remarks. Lastly, we are also pleased to have received the first payment of $2.1 billion in proceeds from the sale of part of our equity position in H3C. Overall, the demand environment this quarter has improved. We saw sequential and year-over-year orders growth, but with some geographic variation. Demand was strong in North America, Asia-Pacific, Japan and India, while Europe and the Middle East lagged. We are aggressively going after the opportunities presented by better market conditions and are well-positioned in a competitive and dynamic environment as we close our fiscal year. I am very proud of the progress we have made in delivering on our edge-to-cloud vision over the last several years, which is generating this performance momentum. We have accelerated innovation across all pillars of our strategy. Networking, hybrid cloud, and AI delivered through a unified cloud-native and AI-driven experience as a part of our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Today, almost 37,000 unique customers use our HPE GreenLake cloud to manage their hybrid IT estate, which drives our annualized revenue run rate subscription growth. In Intelligent Edge, we have invested in building an industry-leading AI-driven networking portfolio. HPE Aruba Networking is a recognized market leader in the campus and branch segment. The AI market requires a modern, high-performing networking fabric as a core foundation to deliver a more efficient data center cloud infrastructure as the world transitions to accelerated computing. We are excited to significantly expand our networking business with the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks. The acquisition of this high-margin business will accelerate our edge-to-cloud vision with a full networking IP stack, from silicon to infrastructure, to the operating system, to security, to software and services in a cloud-native and AI-driven approach. We expect our compelling value proposition will begin to deliver returns to our shareholders in the year post close. In Hybrid Cloud, we redefine the cloud space by delivering an experience that is hybrid by design, with HPE GreenLake at the core of our strategy. We have transitioned our HPE server and HPE storage products to cloud-native and software-defined solutions while adding unique software and services to our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Our innovation gives customer choice and flexibility across all workload types, while managing their public on-prem colos and edges in one unified hybrid cloud operations experience. Our AI business is built on decades of large-scale infrastructure expertise, including technologies like direct liquid cooling that they're powering our largest AI systems for large language model builders, service providers, and supercomputing users. We have rapidly expanded our AI portfolio, including the introduction of HPE Private Cloud AI, specifically engineered for enterprise customers, with the expectation of significant market expansion as we are still in the early stages of adoption. Pursuing this strategy has diversified the HPE portfolio to parts of the market with higher margins. Our differentiation not only makes us highly relevant to customers and partners, but also drives profitable growth for our shareholders. I have a few observations about Q3 performance in our key segments that I will share, and then I will let Marie fully review more detailed results. Our Server segment, again, outperformed expectations in Q3, thanks to an acceleration in converting AI system orders to revenue. We converted about $1.3 billion in AI systems revenue this quarter, a 39% increase from Q2. Revenue from our traditional server business also climbed with a double-digit increase in product orders, both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting an improvement in the market for traditional compute. We continue to pursue profitable deals within our target server margin range, underscoring stability in our operating profit profile. In AI, our momentum is very clear. Customer demand for HPE AI systems rose sequentially, with opportunities increasing in both enterprise and sovereign AI clouds as customers explore more use cases. AI system orders climbed $1.6 billion in the quarter to a cumulative $6.2 billion since Q1 2023, an increase of approximately $3.5 billion over the last year. Customers are exploring new ways to use AI, adding to our already robust pipeline and creating even more runway for our broad AI offerings. Enterprise interest in generative AI is high, and while adoption is still in the initial stages, it is accelerating. Customers tell us that they see the possibilities and are building the business cases. We see use cases across multiple verticals, from healthcare to financial services to manufacturing. As the use cases mature, they need expertise to help guide the implementation across their enterprise business, not just IT. Direct liquid cooling continues to be a key differentiator and demand driver with large-scale AI customers. The expertise in IP required to build and run large direct liquid cooled systems creates a significant margin rich services opportunity for day zero, day one, and day two operations. HPE has one of the largest water cooling manufacturing and services footprint in the world. In the sovereign space, just recently, the U.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory announced that its HPE-built Kestrel supercomputer came fully online over the summer. Kestrel will be five times more powerful than NREL's previous supercomputer, Eagle, and is 100% direct liquid cooled. This system will enable research advancing energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, renewable energy, and energy system integration, including by leveraging the latest innovation in AI large language model, modeling, and simulation. You saw at HPE Discover that HPE is deepening our strong partnership with NVIDIA. In June, we jointly announced NVIDIA AI Computing by HPE, a portfolio of codeveloped AI solutions and joint go-to-market integrations that enable enterprises to accelerate adoption of generative AI. One of those solutions, HPE Private Cloud AI, which just became generally available yesterday, is a turnkey solution that makes it easy for enterprises of all sizes to gain an energy-efficient, fast and flexible option for sustainably developing and deploying generative AI applications. To this adoption, HPE Private Cloud AI will be available in four modular configurations. These start with small-for-small model inferencing needs on NVIDIA L40 and scale up to extra large on NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200s for a configuration that allows for multiple use cases, running inferencing retrieval, augmentation generation, and large language model fine-tuning. We are offering customers two important choice points : self-managed or fully-managed service, with the ability to purchase as-a-service through an operating expenditure model or as a capital expense. With three clicks and less than 30 seconds to deploy, HPE Private Cloud AI dramatically simplifies DevOps, ITOps and FinOps for enterprise customers, allowing them to easily establish and meter their environments, monitor and observe their infrastructure and applications, and lifecycle manage all aspects of their private cloud AI system. And just last week, we further expanded our NVIDIA partnership by adding NVIDIA NIM Agent Blueprints to HPE Private Cloud AI for multiple generative AI use cases. This includes a digital human workflow for customer service, a generative virtual screening workflow for computer-aided drug discovery, and a PDF data extraction workflow for enterprise RAG that uses vast quantity of business data for more accurate responses. Integrating this catalog of pretrained, customizable AI workflows into our HPE Private Cloud AI stack enables customers to easily deploy key AI use cases to accelerate time to value. With a series of announcements about HPE Private Cloud AI, we are well-positioned to serve our enterprise customer needs. Since the announcement less than three months ago, we have seen very high customer interest, with requests for proof of concept demos exceeding our expectations. We are increasing sales resources and enabling our partner ecosystem to meet the high demands for demos. We believe HPE Private Cloud AI is going to be an important growth driver for our hybrid cloud business, and we are filing numerous patents to ensure our leadership is recognized and protected. This innovation and customer interest positions HPE Hybrid Cloud well, as AI is an accelerator for hybrid cloud solutions. We are on a positive trajectory with orders and we are beginning to realize returns from an ongoing investment in both our product portfolio and our specialized sales motions. There is more work to do, but we are pleased that our revenue and profitability both improved quarter-over-quarter. Customers require new data protocols in file and object to store and manage data to train AI applications. We expect that extending our HPE Alletra Storage software-defined offerings to these new data protocols will lead to a higher proportional software and related services in our portfolio. We are seeing double-digits orders growth in HPE Alletra Storage and in HPE GreenLake hybrid cloud SaaS offerings. In just the last three months, almost 3,000 new customers began using our HPE GreenLake cloud, and we added almost 10,000 more customers in the last year. We are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with customers who have turned into HPE GreenLake. We are proud to announce a new agreement with Deloitte to utilize the HPE GreenLake cloud to help transform and centralize Deloitte's IT infrastructure, which includes AI computing. We continue to introduce new hybrid cloud offerings by adding more profitable software and services, which is clearly reflected in our ARR mix now at 71%. For example, at the end of August, we closed our acquisition of Morpheus Data. We believe this acquisition solidifies HPE's leadership position as the first vendor with a full suite of software capabilities across the hybrid cloud stack. We look forward to integrating Morpheus Data multi-cloud automation and orchestration capabilities into our HPE GreenLake cloud platform to complement the AI-driven multi-cloud and multi-vendor observability from HPE's OpsRamp acquisition and our own organic innovation. In Intelligent Edge, we believe we are beginning a market recovery as customers finished digesting previous orders post-COVID. Revenue improved sequentially on gains in services and SASE. Momentum is building and we saw sequential orders increase in all regions with particular strength in North America. On the products front, orders growth was led by wireless LAN, SASE, and data center networking products. Conversely, campus-switching products orders have been slower to recover. Last month, we reinforced HPE Aruba Networking cyber defenses with the new AI-powered network detection and response and campus-based zero trust network access. The solution leverages telemetry from HPE Aruba Networking Central's data lake to train and deploy AI models to monitor and detect unusual activity in vulnerable IoT devices, helping to support mission-critical business processes. Our security solutions are attracted to customers like Nobu Hotels, which is leveraging a secure AI power network combining the HPE Aruba Networking Central platform and HPE Aruba Networking ClearPass to implement a zero trust strategy. This installation will help provide secure, seamless and hyper-personalized guest experiences, including an AI concierge across Nobu's global footprint on luxury hotels. We are excited for what comes next with our pending Juniper Networks acquisition and the comprehensive networking profile we will create. As I have said before, we expect that Juniper will be accretive to our margin profile and non-GAAP EPS in year one. The deal recently received regulatory approvals in the European Union, UK, India, and several other jurisdictions and we remain on track to close in late calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025. Plans are well underway to ensure successful integration post close. To conclude, I am very pleased with our third quarter performance. Our impressive revenue growth reflects the strength of our portfolio and the growing excitement customers have for our newest innovations across AI, network and hybrid cloud. HPE is playing a crucial role in helping customers adopt this transformative technology across their business. As we innovate, we also continue to stay disciplined in the way we manage our business and cost structure. In Q3, we delivered profitable growth for our shareholders in a competitive and dynamic environment. Next month, we look forward to hosting some of you at our incredible Wisconsin manufacturing facility, where we will build many of our industry-leading direct liquid cooled AI systems. The work we do there plays a key role in driving the transition to direct liquid cooled systems and the successful AI revenue conversion we saw this quarter. I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to experience this. Now, I will hand it over to Marie to go through the segment results in greater detail. Marie? Marie Myers : Thank you, Antonio, and good afternoon. We are pleased with our performance this quarter and we did what we said we would do. We delivered strong top-line revenues, grew revenues sequentially in each segment, prudently managed costs, improved profitability sequentially, and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share that exceeded the high end of our guidance range. As Antonio said, we are pleased to have received the $2.1 billion in proceeds from the partial sale of the H3C equity position. Today's results highlight our ability to deliver amidst a dynamic macro environment. While some customers remain cautious and prioritize mission-critical projects, we are encouraged by the recovery in enterprise demand we are seeing in North America, followed by modest improvement across the other geographies. We remain excited about HPE's position across AI, hybrid cloud, and networking. HPE is well-positioned for the AI opportunity. This quarter, our AI systems backlog increased and we grew AI systems revenues approximately 40% sequentially. We continue to win deals with both model builders and sovereigns and are well-positioned to address enterprise AI demand. In traditional servers, we are seeing signs of a recovery as both demand and revenue increase sequentially. In hybrid cloud, we see an improvement in storage, led by the strong demand for our HPE Alletra MP offering, and we continue to drive ARR growth. We are encouraged by the early and strong customer response to our Private Cloud AI offering that we announced at Discover, which we expect to drive AI adoption in the enterprise. Lastly, results were solid in networking. Improving sequential demand in WLAN, data center networking and switching, along with continued growth in security and services, keeps us optimistic heading into the fourth quarter. We continue to make progress towards our strategic goals. Our recently announced acquisition of Morpheus Data that expands our hybrid cloud capabilities and our confidence in closing the Juniper acquisition by the end of calendar year 2024 or early calendar year 2025 are excellent examples. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 and look forward to carrying our momentum through the end of our fiscal year. Now, let me go through the details of the quarter. Revenue grew 10% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency to $7.7 billion, near the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our as-a-service momentum continued this quarter. We grew ARR 39% in constant currency year-over-year to more than $1.7 billion, led by AI through HPE GreenLake and networking and storage subscriptions. With enterprise AI customers, we are noticing a strong appetite for a consumption model, both to alleviate investment pressures as well as to retain flexibility to grow workloads, though this is still early days. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin software and services revenue. This quarter, we expanded the software and services mix of ARR approximately 300 basis points year-over-year to 71%, due to the stronger sales of AI services tied to hardware sales and Aruba Central platform subscriptions. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 31.8%, which was down 410 basis points year-over-year, driven by a lower mix of Intelligent Edge revenue and a higher mix of AI server revenue. The 130-basis-point sequential decline was driven by the higher AI server revenue mix. We have balanced gross margin pressures by executing on strong cost controls and by maintaining pricing discipline in a competitive AI server market. Our non-GAAP operating expenses decreased approximately 7% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter despite a seasonal increase in marketing expenses associated with our annual Discover event. Since joining as CFO, I have taken a rigorous, programmatic approach to streamlining our cost structure to drive operating expense improvements. And we expect to see the benefits of these actions in the second half of the year. This is already evident in our results as we drove a 50-basis-point sequential improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin, offsetting pressures we saw at the gross margin line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was stable at 10%. Profitability improvements and better-than-expected OI&E drove GAAP-diluted net EPS of $0.38 per share and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.50 per share, both above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes $149 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition, and other related charges. Now, let's turn to the segment results, starting with Servers. Strength in both AI systems and traditional servers drove healthy revenue growth and stable operating margins. Server revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter, up 35% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. In traditional servers, we saw steady growth and are seeing signs of a recovery. We saw strength in North America where our installed base is spending more, though EMEA and APJ customers continue to evaluate spend. Our Gen11 product continues to ramp ahead of expectations and now represents a growing proportion of total server revenue. And we have been able to manage an inflationary component environment through dynamic pricing and by leveraging strong supplier relationships. In AI systems, demand remains strong, though large deals continue to be lumpy. AI systems product and services orders rose $1.6 billion sequentially, driving our cumulative orders since Q1 '23 to $6.2 billion. We are pleased with our current AI systems backlog, which has increased quarter-over-quarter to $3.4 billion. Demand remains healthy from the model builders. We are winning deals in this space and following a framework to manage risks and profits. While still early days, we continue to see positive signs from enterprise customers. In fact, more than 80% of enterprises are experimenting with GenAI initiatives, which supports our view that the number of customers will continue to trend favorably. This quarter, our enterprise AI pipeline more than doubled sequentially. And sovereign AI is an adjacency for HPE, right beside our market leadership in supercomputing. We continue to see increasing demand from this set of customers who are embracing AI. Within model builders and sovereign AI, customers is a growing desire for liquid cooling. However, adoption relies on data center readiness. We view HPE's multi-decade design and manufacturing expertise, intellectual property, patent portfolio, and global reach and dedicated services as clear differentiators as the market moves in this direction. Q3 was again a strong quarter for AI system revenue conversion. AI system revenues were $1.3 billion in the quarter, up approximately 40% from the prior quarter. We are pleased with the stability of our operating margins within our Server business. Our Q3 Server operating margin was 10.8%. This was up 70 basis points year-over-year, but down 20 basis points sequentially. AI systems make up a higher share of our total Server revenue compared to one year ago, 10% in Q3 FY '23 versus 30% this quarter. This underscores our disciplined focus on profitability in a competitive AI server market. Our operating margin performance was in line with expectations. For the full year, we continue to expect our Server margins to be at the low end of our target range of 11% to 13%. We will remain disciplined in cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. Now, moving to Hybrid Cloud. Both revenue and profitability improved quarter-over-quarter. Segment revenues of $1.3 billion were down 7% year-over-year, but up 4% sequentially. As we have previously discussed, we are managing both a sales model transition and product transition within the storage business. Our product model transition is to a more cloud-native, software-defined platform with HPE Alletra, which offers a unified storage architecture, comprehensive AIOps, and cross-stack analytics and aligns to customer preferences for a hybrid cloud model. Translating this storage growth to revenues will take time because of the higher mix of ratable software and services, which is deferred into future periods. We continue to see strength for our Alletra MP offering with sequential improvement led by our continued business transformation efforts, particularly in go-to-market. We are seeing signs of improving demand for block storage and early traction in file, and we are closely monitoring the impacts of commodity costs on demand. In our Private Cloud business, we are having constructive conversations with our customers to evaluate their virtualization strategy. At Discover, we announced efforts to develop our virtualization capabilities, which will be available within our Private Cloud Business Edition solution. Lastly, customers are reacting positively to our recently announced Private Cloud AI offering in partnership with NVIDIA, which unifies AI skills, data, architecture and solutions into one fully managed platform and accelerates time to value for enterprises looking to begin their AI journeys. We are seeing traction in both customer demos and pipeline, and as of yesterday, our Private Cloud AI offering is globally available to order. Our Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 5.1%, down 30 basis points year-over-year, but up 430 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls. Moving to Intelligent Edge. Revenues were $1.1 billion, down 23% year-over-year on tough compares, but up 3% sequentially. Demand was steady quarter-over-quarter, backlog remains at normal levels, channel inventory remains healthy, and we believe that we have moved past the trough. On the order side, we are seeing a recovery that is in line with our industry peers. For the second consecutive quarter, we saw order improvements in each of our geographies, led by strength in North America, followed by modest growth at EMEA and APJ. By product, we saw sequential order improvements in data center networking and in in-campus. We grew both services and SASE orders mid- to high-single-digits year-over-year as customers remain excited about our Aruba Central platform that is part of our HPE GreenLake offering. On the revenue side, we drove year-over-year strength in data center networking, SASE, and services, though saw declines in our campus and switching due to difficult annual compares. Our sequential revenue grew approximately 3%, consistent with our expectation that Q2 would be the trough. The segment operating margin of 22.4% was down 520 basis points year-over-year, driven by tough year-over-year revenue compares, offset slightly, but a better year-over-year gross margin rate. Better OpEx was the primary reason for our 60-basis-point sequential improvement in operating margin. Our OpEx plan has put us on a path to achieve operating margins in the mid-20% range by Q4. Now, turning to Financial Services. Our HPE Financial Services revenue were $879 million, up 1% year-over-year, and financing volumes were $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, $800 million of $4.5 billion in financing volume went to AI wins with both cloud and enterprise customers, which illustrates that AI is driving demand across our portfolio. Operating margin of 9% was up 80 basis points year-over-year and down 30 basis points sequentially. Our portfolio remains healthy, and we continue to improve the investment-grade mix. Our Q3 loss ratio remained steady at below 0.5% and our return on equity is a solid 17.4%. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations and $669 million in free cash flow. We are on track for $1.9 billion in free cash flow. We remain confident in our ongoing ability to generate strong free cash flow even as we pursue strategic buys given the rising component cost environment. Our Q3 cash conversion cycle was a positive four days, which is a reduction of 19 days from Q3 '23. Our days of inventory and days of payables were both higher on AI systems orders that outpaced revenue conversion and on our strategic purchases for our server business. We continue to believe working capital to be neutral to free cash flow as we expect declines in inventory led by strong AI system revenue conversion to balance declines in accounts payable as we exit the year. We are pleased to have received the $2.1 billion in proceeds from the partial sale of the H3C equity position. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation framework and are focused on managing our balance sheet and maintaining our dividend. We returned $221 million in capital to shareholders in Q3 and $607 million year-to-date. Now, let's turn to guidance. As Antonio mentioned, we are making steady progress on securing the necessary regulatory approvals required for our pending Juniper acquisition and look forward to closing by the end of calendar year '24 or early calendar year '25. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.4 billion, GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.76 and $0.81, and our non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.52 and $0.57. For revenue, we expect to see sequential growth similar to the last couple of quarters with revenue to remain indexed towards server. We continue to manage the business at the operating income level and, therefore, expect a sequential decline in operating expenses in order to deliver our EPS targets. On a segment basis, we expect the following. For Server, we expect to convert AI systems to revenue at a strong pace. As mentioned, the market remains competitive and large deals remain lumpy. We continue to be time-to-market for GPUs and are looking forward to shipping H200 chips for the AIST supercomputer in Q4. We also expect a continued demand in traditional servers, driven by Gen11 adoption and higher units. We are maintaining our expectation of achieving the low end of our 11% to 13% operating margin range for the full year. For Hybrid Cloud, we expect a slight revenue increase to close the year, though expect pressures from rising commodity costs, particularly in SSDs. ARR growth should continue as our storage business accelerates and shifts to subscription under HPE GreenLake. And we expect operating margins to continue to trend favorably to the mid-single-digit range. For the Intelligent Edge business, we anticipate a slight sequential revenue increase for the fourth quarter on the recovery in campus and WLAN, as well as strength in data center networking. Benefits from our cost reduction efforts materialized in our third quarter results, and we expect a similar trend in the fourth quarter, supporting our outlook for a full year operating margin in the mid-20% range. For the full year, we are tracking towards the high end of our revenue guidance of 1% to 3% growth in constant currency. We expect to balance gross margin pressures from a higher mix of AI systems with continued operating discipline and expect to come in at the low end of our operating profit growth guidance of 0% to 2%. We now expect OI&E to be a $50 million to $100 million headwind versus our prior expectation of $150 million headwind. We have tightened our non-GAAP diluted net EPS expectations for the full year to $1.92 to $1.97. For GAAP EPS, we are now seeing increased costs related to the Juniper transaction, with our expectations now at $1.68 to $1.73. Lastly, we remain committed, in the long term, to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend, and to our investment-grade rating. In the near term, we expect to continue share repurchases at a pace in line with Q3, as we prudently manage our balance sheet ahead of the Juniper transaction closing. To summarize, our Q3 results were strong and demonstrated good sequential revenue growth. With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks, and congrats on the results. Maybe just on the Server margins, given the AI revenue contribution, they were a little bit higher than expected. Could you just break down? Is this from kind of better ProLiant margins, better kind of proprietary Cray margins, just better pricing discipline? Just a little bit more insight into the margin strength we saw there? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yeah, sure. Good afternoon, Meta, and thanks for your question on Server margins. First of all, as I said in my prepared remarks, we did, in fact, ship about $1.3 billion of AI servers in the quarter. So that constituted around about 30% of Server revenue. And despite that, our margins were at 10.8%. And to your point, what was it driven by? So, first of all, we're well on track on the shift to Gen11, and in itself, Gen11 has richer configurations and, therefore, comes with a higher margin profile. Also, I think we've been pretty successful at passing through those commodity costs, and despite the fact that we're in a pretty competitive both CPU and GPU environment. And then lastly, I'd say you would have seen that our OpEx was down sequentially and you're seeing the impact, frankly, of that OpEx discipline show up in the margins as well, Meta. Paul Glaser : Okay. Thank you, Meta. Next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I apologize in advance if there's some background noise because I'm at the airport. I guess, we're getting the most questions today on the gross margin. And Marie, I know you outlined the factors there in terms of the AI server mix. But hoping you can flesh that out a bit more in terms of was there anything outside of the AI server mix that impacted gross margins at the company level in the quarter itself? And as we think about sort of your operating discipline going into the next quarter, should we be expecting sort of further moderation in the gross margins and more operating discipline to help maintain that operating margin outlook? And if I can just add on there, the AI order execution that you're seeing, you mentioned lumpy deals with customers. Is that impacting your thinking on gross margins for the aggregate company as we look forward as well in terms of where -- which verticals those orders are coming from? Thank you. Marie Myers : Hey, Samik, good afternoon. So, I think I've got most of your questions. I'll hit it up in terms of gross margins and what we've seen. So first of all, I would say just if you step back and think about gross margins at a high level, from a year-on-year perspective, just to remind everybody that obviously the contribution from our networking revenue is lowest. Obviously, that's impacted gross margins from a year-on-year basis. Now, when you look sequentially, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, the AI mix of servers, we converted at a much faster pace. And obviously, that's really driven margin -- gross margin in the quarter. Now, I would add to your point, we've been offsetting it with prudency on OpEx. You've seen that we're going to continue to do that. I think I mentioned that in my guide comments. And then, also, we continue to have a mindset about being very disciplined on cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. I think we talked about the fact we're selective on deals. And you see that frankly, if you look at the quality of our receivables, you'll see it in our receivables. Now, a couple of things to sort of bear in mind as we go forward. As we see enterprise AI gain momentum, that's going to have a more favorable impact on gross margins. So, we do expect that we'll see improving profitability as the market moves in that direction. And then finally, Samik, just to sort of bear in mind that we're getting closer to the close of Juniper. We expect to see that the end of calendar '24, beginning of '25. In itself, that transaction is going to have a significant impact on both gross and operating margins. And we expect that more than 50% of the company's operating profit will come from networking. So that's how I'd sort of leave it with you in terms of thinking about margins. And as we said, we'll continue to focus on managing OpEx and being very prudent on deals. Paul Glaser : Thank you, Samik. Gary, next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit, your line is open on our end, perhaps it's muted on yours. Amit Daryanani : Sorry. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Marie, I was hoping you can talk a bit more about the free cash flow numbers. It was down a fair bit year-over-year. Maybe you can just talk about what is driving the downtick in free cash flow. Is there a way to think about the headwind you're seeing from the AI ramps versus the strategic pre-buys? Just talk about what those buckets are? And then, related to free cash flow, I think last quarter, it was at least $1.9 billion for the full year. I think this time it's $1.9 billion. So, seems like a bit of a downtick. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but could you just talk about how do you think about that October quarter free cash flow number as well? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yeah, sure. No worries, Amit. And so, yeah, I think you probably are -- just in terms of where we're at in cash flow, let me hit Q3 and then I'll go into Q4. So, from a Q3 perspective, it's really driven by a couple of things. Firstly, the timing of working capital, and also just some of the normal seasonality that we see. And then, as we get into Q4, we do expect to see some of the benefits of working capital. So, we'll see a reversal in CCC, and that will benefit free cash flow. And then, obviously, we're going to see that stronger conversion of AI revenue. I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're going to see a sequential improvement in the shipment of AI revenue. So, you can see that will also have an impact on our free cash flow. So, for the full year, Amit, I'd just say we are still on track for $1.9 billion. It's just as you could imagine, we're in Q3 now, we're getting into Q4, we sort of tightened up the expectations given where we're at in the year. So, still on track for $1.9 billion, Amit. Paul Glaser : Very good. Thank you, Amit. Next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. You did mention repeatedly the lumpiness of AI server deals, and I'm wondering if there was any unusually large deals in Q3, or whether you're anticipating your AI bookings to be significantly different in Q4. And then just on the free cash flow, Marie, net income is going to be about $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Free cash flow is going to be about $1.9 billion. That's about 75% realization. I think since HPE split-off, free cash flow realization has actually been even lower than that. How do we think about that going forward? I presume free cash flow realization will be less than [1%] (ph) for next year and maybe even the following year because of Juniper integration charges? Or where is the pathway to where we can see free cash flow to net income being positive? Antonio Neri : Yeah. Thank you, Toni. This is Antonio. I'm going to take the first part. The quick answer is no. There have not been very, very large deals or lumpy deals. It's been more spread and more uniform across the service provider space. And on the enterprise side, because obviously, we talk about this, the percentage of bookings relative to the $1.6 billion was -- as a mix, was in the mid-teens. So, very consistent with the prior year's quarter. However, obviously, the dollars are much larger, right, because now this quarter, we book $1.6 billion. So, I actually argue this is a good thing. And we don't expect significant super-large deals, I'd call it, in Q4 based on what we have visibility in the pipeline, but more a continuation of what we saw in Q3. And Marie, you want to talk about the free cash flow? Marie Myers : Yeah. No, just, Toni, I mean, I think in terms of your comments on free cash flow, from an FY '24 perspective, I mean, in terms of bridging net earnings to free cash flow, it's the normal puts and takes for the year, so working capital, CapEx, et cetera. and sort of employee benefits. So, there is no specific charges in there in terms of our working capital -- sort of our net earnings for the year to free cash flow. In terms of '25, what we said, Toni, I think in the transaction stays the same. And look, honestly, we'll be guiding '25 when we do our next earnings call. So, I'll provide more color around free cash flow for '25 as we get into the next call. Paul Glaser : All right. Thank you, Toni. Next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mike Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. I just had a question about the mix of products and services for the AI systems orders and revenues that you guys disclosed on Slide 12. I guess, I was struck by two things. First, the growing share of services as a percentage of AI system orders, should we expect that to continue over time? And what are some of the key services you're selling with AI systems? And then, second, the very little services revenue that's being recognized to-date, as you recognize that services revenue in AI systems, should that improve the margins for server margins and AI system margins? And how much can that improve margins by? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah, thanks, Mike. Yeah, listen, we are very pleased with the services attached momentum on the AI systems portion of our business, which I believe will continue to grow as we grow the enterprise segment of the market, because that segment of the market comes with more rich services day zero, day one and day two services like we call it. And yesterday was the first day it became available out of HPE Private Cloud AI, and that has quite a bit of services component with it. And so -- but right now, as we started disclosing last quarter, the services component of that which you saw in one of the slides, as Marie was providing her remarks, much of that is pretty much all deferred. So, unless we are doing an installation and that gets recognized immediately, most of that is the maintenance that gets recognized over the length of the contract. And therefore, over time, we expect that will be contributing positive to our gross margins in the segment that we recognize that revenue, which obviously is the Server segment of the market. So, yes, but I'm positive on both gross margin accretion as we recognize the revenue and more services as we start selling the HPE Private Cloud in the enterprise space. Paul Glaser : Thank you, Mike. Next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much. I wanted to see, Antonio, if you could talk a little bit about the trends with traditional servers, given we hear these arguments that AI-accelerated platforms would cannibalize traditional servers, but you're seeing good growth and good order patterns. How should we think about the risk that maybe that cannibalization eventually happens, or how are you really thinking about traditional versus AI? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yeah. Thank you, Simon. We have seen no signs of cannibalization into the traditional server market. And remember, I always try to bring a segment point of view, right? So, the segment point of view in the AI space, you have three segments. You have the service providers, model builders, which obviously include the hyperscalers, and there we have not sold traditional servers in a long time once we made the decision in 2017 to not participate in that market. And then, you have the sovereign space, which is now going up in term of interest, but the sales cycles are longer because of the government engagements and the procurement, but there, generally speaking, there is no traditional service per se. It's a combination of architectures and GPUs and CPUs in a unique form factor. And then last but not least, we have the enterprise. And the enterprise, while it's growing, has been very much focused on the AI applications. And for customers to move a traditional workload, call it, legacy workloads and the like, to a accelerated compute, the question is why you will do that when, A, you need to use the accelerated compute to either fine-tune the model or to do inferencing; and second, from a PCO perspective, there is no clear view that, that will be cost less. And so that's why when I think about workloads and customer segments, we don't see signs of cannibalization from the AI deployments into the traditional workloads. Paul Glaser : Thank you, Simon. Gary, next question, please. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yeah, thank you so much. Antonio, I was wondering if you could just share some color on why the -- on what the AI backlog composition is across maybe your portfolio where you're seeing more strength versus not. And within the enterprise demand commentary that you're calling out, can you share some color on what kind of projects are being evaluated? I know you called out some verticals like healthcare and financial services. Curious if you could provide some color on that as well. Thank you so much. Antonio Neri : Yeah. So, first of all, the pipeline we have in front of us is multiples of the current backlog, which is a positive news, because that tells you the momentum will continue in the next few quarters. Second is that the backlog composition, as I said, in the mid-teens is the enterprise space and the rest is the traditional service provider space. On the service provider space is basically compute capacity to train models or to do hosting for that matter, in large colos. And then, on the enterprise space is really focused on the use cases where they see clear line of sight for the return on that investment, and there are several use cases by segment that customers by verticals that they are driving. Obviously, many of them are very obvious. And now we are seeing a little bit more sophistication in some of those use cases and the maturity of. And that's why our Private Cloud AI offering is targeting those type of customers, because ultimately comes with entire stack from the, what I call, the workloads at the top, specifically designed for the verticals, down into the training models, all the way down to the infrastructure. They are sized for that type of deployment. And then, on the sovereign AI, obviously, we see now a significant interest. We are working across multiple geos on several opportunities. A lot of them are basically to open AI clouds for sovereign reasons or privates and compliance reasons on data. And a lot of them actually want to look a little bit like supercomputers in many ways because many of those systems are designed to do both AI large language models, and that's very obvious with some of the deployments we have done in the European Union and the one we're going to do now for the U.K. And other ones are basically for traditional supercomputing. So, the infrastructure in the end is the same. All of these systems are very much liquid cooled systems. And so, that's an opportunity for us. But on the enterprise side, I think you can see now expansion from traditional bots and customer service into other areas in finance, manufacturing, marketing, where they can see the clear return on that investment. And we're helping them even upfront through a partner ecosystem to define those use cases, because ultimately, it goes beyond just deploying IT, but they're really to realize the business value. Paul Glaser : Thank you, Wamsi. Last question, please. Operator : And the final question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey, guys, yeah, good afternoon. Really appreciate you taking the question. Maybe, Antonio, actually just dovetailing from there, like I'd love any more insight you can give a context around, like what's the HPE sort of sweet spot right now for business you win in GenAI, like what types of deployments or workloads? And then, how do you see that -- do you see that changing, or how do you see that evolving over the next few years as well? And that's it for me. Thanks, guys. Antonio Neri : Well, I think right now, one of the key sweet spots is we now have to build and deploy and run these large systems. That requires a unique expertise. That's why you see the services portion being attached to those assistants. And ultimately, you need expertise both in the manufacturing space. And again, we're going to host our AI Day in one of, what I believe is, the largest footprints in the world where you can see how this gets done. And then, on the services side, you should not underestimate the services expertise needed to run. But for enterprise, where is the next big thing is -- in my view, is all about the simplicity. And several of the patterns we are actually filing and getting done are actually in areas like ease of use, automation, obviously, security. These are all spaces where we are actually building all those capabilities in our offer. And remember, all of this gets built inside HPE GreenLake as we deploy these optimized infrastructure and configurations. And that's why for me, GreenLake is an important component of our AI strategy, because ultimately, we manage a lot of the deployment on-prem through enterprise customers, specifically, through HPE GreenLake. And that's an accelerator and a way to upsell, cross-sell, build, ultimately, customers' confidence and control of the data, which is the fundamental value when it comes down to AI. And then, next year, once we close the Juniper transaction, we're going to add another key component, which is the networking piece. And it's very important that we recognize that AI, A, is a hybrid workload. The core foundation of that across hybrid is the network. And HPE will have unique IP and capabilities in that space in addition to the traditional server storage, which is now certified for AI, and then the GreenLake software and services attached to it. And that's how I want to think about it. Independent businesses are all accretive to AI, but then when we get to a solution, HPE will have the full-stack solution to offer to our enterprise customers. Paul Glaser : Thank you very much. Antonio, any comments? Antonio Neri : Yeah, no, thank you very much for the time. Again, I will say we delivered a strong quarter. We drove very strong revenue growth. We said what -- we did what we said. And honestly, I'm very confident about the next quarter and what comes next after the Juniper acquisition. I'm super-pleased that we also closed the first tranche of our H3C put option. Obviously, that took a lot of work in an environment that's complex. And as you think about our ability to deliver profitable growth is there. I understand the questions around margins, but when I think about margins, on the server side, we are consistently driving a stable around 11% or so operating margins. We think about that way more than gross margin because ultimately it's all about cash. And then, ultimately, on the networking and hybrid cloud is about both gross margin, because of our content is more software and services, while we'll deliver on the bottom-line. So, I think our strategy all coming together, but it's very competitive dynamic there and we have to execute every day with discipline, which is what we did again this quarter. And again, we raised guidance for the full year on the EPS side of the house. So, thank you very much for your time. And I look forward to hosting some of you at our facility in Wisconsin on October 10. Paul Glaser : Very good. Thank you, everyone, for joining today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.",

At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Paul Glaser : Good afternoon. I am Paul Glaser, Head of Investor Relations for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I would like to welcome you to our fiscal 2024 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Antonio Neri, HPE's President and Chief Executive Officer and Marie Myers, HPE's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call to Antonio, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call concludes.

Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency. Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation and their prepared comments. With that, let me turn it over to Antonio. Antonio Neri : Thank you, Paul, and thank you all for joining us today. Before I share my comments on our quarterly and yearly performance, I would like to provide an update on the Juniper Network's acquisition. We have received approvals from key geographies around the world, including the European Union, UK, India, South Korea and Australia, which have given unconditional clearance and see the competitive benefits of the transaction. In the United States, we are engaged with the Department of Justice, and we expect the review will continue in the coming into the new calendar year. We anticipate the deal will close in the early part of 2025, within the previously stated timeframe. Both HPE and Juniper continue to believe the transaction will enable us to provide a complete portfolio of modern, secure networking solutions that offer essential foundations for both Hybrid Cloud and AI. The combined companies' enhanced ability to compete and innovate will fundamentally improve the networking industry. This transaction will also strengthen U.S. National Security interests by advancing HPE's position as a strong U.S. Innovator among global technology companies. Turning to results, we had an exceptional fourth quarter to cap off a strong year. In actual dollar terms, we generate a record quarterly revenue of $8.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year, exceeding $8 billion for the first time in our history. Our results reflect the continued adoption of HPE GreenLake and the acceleration of our revenue growth in AI. Q4 and fiscal year 2024 results exceeded our expectations for revenue, dilute and net earnings per share and free cash flow. We draw sequential revenue growth across each of our segments, a continuation of the positive momentum we saw build throughout the year across our business. Q4 constituted our third consecutive quarter of improved year-over-year growth rates and revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, and non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. Contributed significantly to our performance was record server revenue of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year, a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Sequentially, AI systems revenue was up 16% to $1.5 billion, exiting fiscal year 2024 with $6.7 billion in cumulative orders since Q1 of fiscal year 2023. After the close of Q4, I am pleased to share that our AI systems demand remains strong. We have received new orders bringing AI systems backlog to over $3.5 billion. Our traditional server business also continues to reflect the [improvement market dynamics] (ph) as we draw our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit orders growth. Hybrid cloud revenue grew 18% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, resulting in revenue of $1.6 billion, with increasing revenue for HPE Private Cloud and continued growth in HPE Storage. We are seeing customers like Lupin Limited, a large India pharmaceutical company, repatriate workloads from the public cloud to enhance their data security amid regulatory and compliance requirements. Customer adoption of our HPE Alletra Storage MP solutions continues to rise at an accelerated pace. Since launch, we have sold approximately 3,000 systems. Miami-Dade County, the seventh most populous county in the United States, implemented HPE Alletra Storage MP to consolidate an existing storage footprint to lower TCO and improve performance and sustainability. Our Intelligent Edge business achieved its third consecutive quarter of orders growth, reflecting our expectations for an improving demand environment. We are particularly pleased with the double-digit year-over-year orders growth that we saw in data center networking, an important growth market for our HPE Aruba Networking business. HPE financial services financing volumes of $2.1 billion rose to an all-time high this quarter, driven by strong demand for HPE GreenLake and AI Financing. It is clear customers need more investment capacity whether to deploy AI or to accelerate the adoption of [Hybrid Cloud] (ph). Our record-breaking revenue performance in Q4 resulted in record profitability with non-GAAP operating profit of $938 million. That translated to non-GAAP operating margin of more than 11%, a 110 basis points increase sequentially. As a result of our exceptional Q4 performance, fiscal year 2024 revenue growth topped 3% year-over-year, exceeding $30 billion as we added more than 9,000 new customers across the portfolio. Combined with our discipline operating expense management, which accelerated in the back-half of the year, we generated a record-breaking $2.3 billion in free cash flow, exceeding our guidance of at least $1.9 billion for the year. We closed the year on a strong note, exceeding our full year commitments for revenue, diluted net earnings per share, and free cash flow. We are very pleased with our results and excited about the opportunities ahead for HPE. It is clear our strategy is working. We have a tremendous set of assets, including extensive solutions from-edge to-cloud, enabling us to meet our customer needs across AI, networking, and hybrid cloud. Providing a full stack of product and services clearly differentiates us versus our competition and accelerates value for our shareholders. In Q4, we continue our investment in innovation, which further enhances our product portfolio and positions us to capture additional market share. AI is clearly transformative for our customers, and HPE is positioned to lead in the next wave of innovation. At our recent AI day, we announced the industry-first, 100% fanless direct liquid cooling architecture, a critical capability for customers to leverage the next generation of direct liquid cooled GPUs and CPUs, while facilitating peak performance as they manage increased energy densities. This industry-first architecture is unique to HPE and results from decades of experience in liquid cooling technologies. Two weeks ago, at SC24, we announced our newest 400 gigabits HPE Slingshot Direct Liquid Cool networking fabric of products, engineered to support both generative AI cluster workloads and exascale supercomputing. These innovations are enhancing the performance of our AI systems and supercomputing product lines, differentiating us from the competition. At SC24, we also announced that HPE has delivered the fastest verified supercomputer in the world to the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. El Capitan is not only the world's fastest supercomputer at more than 1.7 exaflop, it is also among the most energy efficient in the world. HPE now has deployed seven of the top 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, including numbers one, two, and three on the list. We also continue to innovate to help accelerate enterprise adoption of AI. Since launching HPE Private Cloud AI, we have expanded our collaboration with Deloitte to help businesses of all sizes to deploy AI solutions tailored for their industry-specific use cases such as C-suite AI and many others. In addition, we introduced the Unleash AI Partner Program to grow our ecosystem and expand customers' ability to address their AI use cases with HPE Private Cloud AI. While we are still in early days, interest is strong with hundreds of customers in the pipeline, with many compelling proof-of-concept underway. We closed our first deals during Q4, including RWE, a leading company in the field of renewable energy, which selected HPE Private Cloud AI to unlock insights from weather data. Customers are also asking us to help them simplify their VMware private clouds and optimize their virtualization costs. At HPE Discover Barcelona 2 weeks ago, we launched HPE VM Essentials, which enables customers to manage their virtualization states across HPE VMware and many others. We have built on our recent acquisitions of Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, giving customers operational flexibility and allowing them to no longer be locked into a single virtualization vendor. With HPE VM Essentials, they can achieve up to 5 times lower TCO. As a part of our HPE VM Essentials, we also provide an enterprise-grade open-source KVM virtualization solution. This allows customers to dramatically reduce costs, while increasing their flexibility to innovate across a full suite of hybrid cloud operations capabilities in an on-premises multi-stack and a multi-cloud public environment. In storage, we continue to invest in our multi-protocol HPE Alletra Storage MP platform as we transition our storage portfolio to an AI-driven, cloud-native, and disaggregated architecture. Our new HPE Alletra Storage MP X 10000 is a revolutionary new high-performance object storage designed for AI exabyte scale and optimized for high-speed unstructured data lakes with [rapid] (ph) restore for backup and recovery. Our AWS S3 compatible object storage interface and deduplication, supports up to 20 times data reduction and streamlines integration with any available backup solution in the market. With HPE Alletra Storage MP X 10000, customers can achieve up to 6 times faster object storage performance compared to competitor solutions in the market. Finally, our Innovation Intelligent Edge are helping us to advance HPE Aruba Networking Central with AIOps copilot capabilities built into our HPE GreenLake cloud. During the quarter, we announced two new solutions to enhance the networking operators experience and security for our customers. The first is the integration with HPE OpsRamp to monitor third-party devices. We also introduced a behavioral analytical-based network detection and response capability, where we are leveraging network and telemetry to train AI models to monitor customer IoT devices. We have an important place in the market, as a leading technology innovator. I am proud that HPE team members around the globe, bring our innovations to customers every day to help them modernize their IT infrastructure and transform for the better. I am very pleased with our exceptional fourth quarter results and the resulting outperformance in several of our full year commitments to our shareholders. Our strategy is well aligned to the mega trends reshaping networking, hybrid cloud, and AI, and our unique product portfolio is well-positioned to capture new customers and accelerate value for our shareholders. We expect the pending acquisition of Juniper Networks to further enhance our portfolio providing customers with complete edge-to-cloud solutions. I am extremely excited about the significant opportunity we have in the coming fiscal year to drive increased value for our shareholders. I am optimistic about what we can achieve and look forward to the year ahead. Now let me turn the call over to Marie, who will provide more details about our Q4 results and guide for the first quarter. Marie? Marie Myers : Thank you, Antonio and good afternoon. We ended fiscal 2024 on solid footing and exceeded what we said we would do. We achieved record quarterly revenue, delivered solid profitability, and generated free cash flow above our guidance. We executed well in a dynamic environment, growing revenue sequentially in each segment as investments in AI are leading to infrastructure refreshes. In Q4, we also maintained disciplined cost management and improved non-GAAP operating profit. A few highlights from our 2024 results. We grew AI systems revenue more than 150% to $4.1 billion and met our server non-GAAP operating margin target. We continued our product transition within storage and ended the year with Alletra MP accounting for a meaningful portion of total storage orders. Our transition to more software defined storage will drive a greater mix of higher-margin recurring revenue over the long-term. Lastly, in Intelligent Edge, we rightsized our cost structure as we navigated a digestion period. We grew fiscal 2024 revenue 3% to $30.1 billion exceeding the high-end of the outlook range we provided in September. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.99 and free cash flow of $2.3 billion both came in above our revised outlook ranges. In total we returned $826 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Overall, our results reflect focused execution and improving demand as customers implement AI strategies. Let me dive into the details of the quarter. We delivered record quarterly revenue and our second highest non-GAAP diluted net EPS, both of which came in above the high end of guidance. Total revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter to a record $8.5 billion. Growth in the quarter was led by strong conversion of AI systems backlog, refreshes in traditional compute, better than expected performance within Hybrid Cloud, and a continued recovery in networking. We are pleased to report non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 above the high-end of guidance despite dilution from the issuance of our convertible preferred securities in September which was not factored into our outlook. ARR grew 48% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, nearly doubling since Q1 2023 primarily driven by HPE GreenLake. We added approximately 2,000 new HPE GreenLake customers during the quarter ending the year with approximately 39,000 unique customers. I am happy to report continued demand for our differentiated AI system offerings, which resulted in strong double-digit sequential revenue growth to $1.5 billion. This record contribution from AI systems revenue, combined with lower mix of Intelligent Edge, drove gross margin down 390 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 30.9%. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year, as reported and were down $5 million quarter-over-quarter, as we focus on streamlining our cost structure and are closely managing discretionary expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 11.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. Strong profitability rolled through to free cash flow, which exceeded our expectations and totaled $1.5 billion. Fiscal 2024 free cash flow was $2.3 billion our highest ever for the full year. GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.99 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 were both above guidance, benefiting from better than expected OI&E and expense management. GAAP EPS benefited primarily from a lower than previously expected tax expense on our aggregated H3C dispositions. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes the gain, we recognized on the partial sale of our H3C investment at $162 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and other related charges and amortization of intangibles. Now let's turn to the segment results. Our server business was a key driver of record quarterly revenue and grew double digits year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter. Server revenue achieved an all-time high of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year and up 9% quarter-over-quarter with sequential growth in AI systems and traditional servers. The traditional compute business continued its momentum during the quarter and grew sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by ongoing refreshes to our Gen11 server products, which carry higher AUPs. Adoption has been strongest in North America and Europe, as customers are investing in new workloads. In the fourth quarter, Gen11 accounted for more than two-thirds of our core compute revenue and contributed to AUP growth. In AI systems, we continue to grow the business to new highs. AI systems orders during the quarter were in-line with our expectations at approximately $1.2 billion. However, we had an order [de-book] (ph) in Q4, leaving our net orders for the quarter at approximately $500 million. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have received orders that bring our current backlog to over $3.5 billion. As we have mentioned before, AI systems orders can be lumpy and this is an example of that. Fourth quarter server operating margin was 11.6%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to Hybrid Cloud, we grew revenue 18% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter to $1.6 billion, materially exceeding our guidance of a slight revenue increase. Revenue growth was led by Private Cloud and the continued ramp of Alletra MP. During the quarter, we received our first orders for Private Cloud AI as we target a growing pipeline that includes corporations across verticals and regions. Interest is strong in manufacturing, education, and financial services. We have also deployed Private Cloud AI internally and are moving use cases from the public cloud due to better cost performance and compliance. In storage, we are balancing investments in owned IP products against market trends. Alletra MP remains ahead of our expectations and is the fastest ramping storage product in our company's history. Keep in mind, these sales carry a higher portion of deferred software and services revenue, which takes longer to translate to the P&L but benefits margins long-term. Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 7.7%, up 390 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls. Now on to Intelligent Edge. We believe the business remains at a path of recovery and customers have largely digested excess inventories. Total Intelligent Edge revenue was $1.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter. Sequentially, we saw growth in services, WLAN products and software, partially offset by declines in switching and campus. Importantly, we are seeing more large deals in our pipeline, giving us confidence that demand is improving. Keep in mind, we were still benefiting from the drawdown of networking backlog in Q1 of fiscal 2024. Operating margin of 24.4% was down 270 basis points year-over-year but up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to lower OpEx in-line with our expectations. Lastly, Financial Services. Our Financial Services business generated $893 million of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Financing volumes increased 41% year-over-year to a new all-time high of $2.1 billion. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady near 0.5% and return on equity totaled 17%. Operating margin was 9.2%, up 120 basis points year-over-year and up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Moving to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated strong operating cash flow of $2 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, both of which exceeded our expectations due to higher revenue and increased collections. For the full year, free cash flow was a record $2.3 billion, above our guidance of $1.9 billion. Q4 cash conversion cycle was a negative 12 days, down 8 days from Q4 '23 and down 16 days from last quarter. Inventory ended the year at $7.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter due to the nature of our AI systems business. We are focused on reducing inventory during fiscal 2025 as we convert AI systems backlog and grow our storage business. During Q4, we returned $169 million via dividends and $50 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively. We returned a total of $826 million during the full year. Moving to our outlook for fiscal Q1 2025. As Antonio said, we expect to close the Juniper transaction in early 2025 at which time we will provide combined company guidance for fiscal 2025. However, let me provide some high-level thoughts, as to how we are thinking about the upcoming year. Overall customer conversations indicate higher IT spending in 2025 with multiple tailwinds that should contribute to revenue growth. We expect continued recovery in traditional compute and growing adoption of AI systems by enterprises and sovereigns, although we expect orders to remain competitive and lumpy. In Hybrid Cloud, we are beginning to see customers accelerate digital transformation projects in order to execute on AI strategies. And in networking, we expect demand will modestly recover throughout the year. For the first quarter we expect year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid-teens. On a sequential basis, this is in-line with normal seasonality. We expect server revenue to be down quarter-over-quarter. We expect flat to modest growth sequentially in traditional compute and lower AI systems contribution following a very strong quarter. Server operating margin will be closer to 10% to 11%, as customers navigate the transition to next-gen GPUs. In Hybrid Cloud, we expect a sequential decline in the first quarter due to stronger than seasonal growth in Q4, with operating margin in the mid-single-digit range. And in networking, we are still managing prolonged sales cycles and expect the business to be around historical seasonality of flattish sequential growth. We expect Intelligent Edge operating margin to be in the low 20% range due to mix. Gross margin will benefit from a more favorable revenue mix, and we expect a modest sequential decrease in OpEx. OI&E is expected to positively contribute to the bottom-line with higher net interest income more than offsetting $0.02 of headwinds associated with the cost of our Juniper Financing. Overall, we estimate Q1 GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.31 and $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.47 and $0.52 based on 1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding, including $76 million of dilution from our convertible preferred securities. For free cash flow, we typically consume cash in the first quarter. We intend to procure components needed to meet current and future AI systems demand, while continuing to manage inventory. For Q1, we intend to buy back shares of common stock at a similar pace to Q4. We remain committed in the long-term to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend, and our investment-grade rating. In summary, we delivered strong Q4 results and ended fiscal 2025, well positioned to drive profitable growth and generate free cash flow that we can reinvest into the business while also returning capital to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question today will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Hi, yes. Thank you so much. Congrats on the strong quarter and guide, especially given the dilution from the preferred stock. As we look at your AI business, the -- can you maybe give us some sense of how your AI pipeline is shaping up, given that the backlog levels kind of dipped in the quarter? And I know you made some comments about how it's backed up intra-quarter. But can you give us some sense of how the pipeline looks and what the composition of that could be? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. This is Antonio. And good afternoon. The pipeline is a multiple of the current backlog which we shared as of a day ago, which is basically more than $3.5 billion. And inside our pipeline, obviously remember there is four key segments of the market. Obviously, the biggest driver continues to be what I call segment one or model builders, hyperscalers as well as now the Tier 2, Tier 3 that they are in the business to provide GPU capacity on demand on a per hour basis. So they continue to be the two biggest driver. But what I'm really pleased, and Maria and I have made those comments in our remarks, is the fact that we see now the enterprise AI pipeline continue to grow steadily. There are hundreds of customers on that pipeline. The size of the deal will vary obviously because it's not the same size of the deal of the other two segments. But there are some very interesting large-sized deals in the pipeline, and they are doing proof-of-concept. But the positive news is that, remember that we made the announcement of the offer that co-engineered solution with NVIDIA in June, and we made it available only on September 9. So really, we had 7 weeks to be able to collect orders. We already collected orders in enterprise AI and we already closed deals in enterprise AI. And two weeks ago, we made additional enhancement to the offer, particularly with a partner ecosystem, including Deloitte. So very pleased. This is going to be a growth driver in 2025, as we go forward. And then on the first [segment] (ph), obviously, the transition, I would say, to the latest GPUs that will happen over the course of the next few quarters. Paul Glaser : Okay, Wamsi. Next question please. Operator : And your next question today will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks and congrats on the quarter. Maybe diving into gross margins. Can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on maybe particularly server margin this quarter and just kind of the weight of some of the XD servers versus El Capitan recognition? Or just some of the dynamics that play on gross margins would be helpful. Thank you. Marie Myers : Hi, Meta, good afternoon. It's Marie. And first of all, I'll just add up by saying, as you know, we typically don't get into gross margin at the segment level, but let me give you some color around how we think about our op margins. First of all, I'd say look, from a service segment perspective, really pleased with the performance in the quarter. We were at 11.6%. And if you think about it, we actually had our highest ever AI server revenue of $1.5 billion. So I think you can see just the performance there. In terms of the color and how to think about it, El Capitan actually was included in the quarter so we did actually get the final acceptances. A couple of points to note. If you look at the mix inside server, we see traditional compute particularly Gen11, we're about two-thirds of the mix so far to-date, and that particularly has higher configurations. And as a result, it is driving richer AUPs and obviously higher structural margins. And also, frankly, we've been really successful about passing over commodity costs. And if you look at both the GPU servers, it is competitive but you can see the revenue scale is helping us out there. And then finally, I think we've been really prudent with our cost controls and all of that's playing off in terms of our OpEx discipline. So that's how we're thinking about server margins. Antonio Neri : But in addition to what Marie said Meta, is this was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year orders growth in the traditional server. And when I think about the opportunity ahead of us, there are just for HPE, 0.5 million units in the installed base that must be refreshed for several reasons number one, they are doing very little work and consuming a lot of energy. Number two is because they have reaching or they are reaching the depreciation cycle. And when enterprise customers think about deployment of AI, they need to free up space, power and cooling to absorb this new system. So this is a big opportunity for us, both from a units perspective and obviously Gen11 comes with a different configuration, as Marie said, and then the services touch that comes with it. Paul Glaser : Thank you Meta. Next question please. Operator : And your next question today will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. I was hoping I could ask a two-parter on the AI service. First, can you just clarify that de-book comment that came in? It sounds like $700 million de-book of backlog. Was that a competitive loss or someone had double ordered or something else that was going on there? And then the second part, following on the gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about when you're looking at AI business, what are the metrics you are looking at? Are you -- do you have thresholds for gross margin or cash flow or something else that prohibits you from going at certain deals where maybe ODMs or lower gross margin OEMs would go? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Sure, and thank you for the question. As we said before, orders during the quarter were in-line with our expectations. In fact, we booked $1.2 billion of new orders in Q4. However, we de-booked a large order, which was $700 million during the same quarter because we had concern with a specific customer. And we proud ourselves of a very strong control of this environment, and we continue to be very vigilant about how we engage and making sure we manage the risk. And we felt that already carried a lot of risk, and therefore we felt it was very prudent to de-book it and focus on other areas of the business. And that's why as we keep going throughout the next few weeks, up to yesterday, we ended up with a backlog now which is more over the $3.5 billion. So that's what happened. It has nothing to do with competitive. It has nothing to do with everything else. We had a concern with a specific customer, and we decided it was prudent to de-book it. Marie Myers : Yes. And Tim, just to add on how we think about margin structure and AI systems, I think we've said this in the past, but look we have a framework that we use for our pricing, and it's absolutely our intention to remain disciplined both on cost and price as we pursue profitable growth. I think that has been our mantra. But obviously then, we're out there balancing those gross margin pressures with cost control, strategic buys, and you've seen that in terms of our pricing discipline. And I would add -- and I think Antonio made this comment earlier that we do see over time, improving profitability as the market moves more to, I think, the two sectors that Antonio referred to, both in terms of sovereign and enterprise where we see services attach, et cetera. So just use that as a way to think about the longer-term sort of margin structure as well. Paul Glaser : Thank you Tim. Next question please. Operator : Your next question today will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if I just look at the corporate level, you've had a couple of quarters with gross margins have been down a fair bit year-over-year. I think it was [down like 390] (ph) basis points this quarter. Could you just talk like, A, what's driving this gross margin degradation for you folks? But it clearly looks like you're able to offset all of this with some really good OpEx control. [As we just] (ph) talk about what's driving the gross margin decline? And then how low can you take OpEx at this point, given your expectations for revenue growth in the next fiscal year? Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes, no worries Amit. Good afternoon. It's Marie. So why don't I take that one? On gross margin, so for Q4, as you rightly said, it was 30.9% so we're down both on a year-on-year and Q-on-Q basis. If you step back and look at the overall revenue mix, perhaps one of the largest drivers is really just the lower contribution of the Intelligent Edge revenue. And in fact, in Q4, Amit, it was actually the lowest for the entire year. And obviously, we had a higher contribution inside of servers of AI systems revenue and product mix. So that obviously impacted gross margin. But what I would say is despite that headwind, we actually grew gross profit dollars both year-on-year and Q-on-Q. Now going forward, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we do actually expect to see gross margin will be up modestly in terms of the improved business mix and predominantly, that's driven by the Intelligent Edge mix. But from a longer-term perspective, just two things to keep in mind. First of all obviously, when we closed Juniper, that is going to be a big driver and has a very positive impact on both gross and operating. We expect that 50% of operating profit going forward will come from Juniper. And secondly as I mentioned earlier I think when I answered Tim's question, we do expect, particularly in the AI space, those higher margin opportunities as we move more into seeing the adoption of sovereign and enterprise. On the cost side of the house, really pleased with the work we've done so far to-date. We've been really focused on discretionary costs throughout '24. We're moving more into areas of productivity. Amit, as we look at '25, we are actually using GenAI inside the company, using it in finance to help drive productivity. So we see opportunities like that throughout the company. I would just say at a company as large as HPE, there's plenty of opportunity, Amit. Paul Glaser : Thank you Amit. Next question please. Operator : And your next question today will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the questions. I think in your commentary on the outlook, you indicated that traditional servers would be flattish to even slightly up sequentially in the January quarter, which I think defies seasonality. So I just want to verify if I got that correct. Maybe if you could unpack what's happening in that part of the business. Thank you. Marie Myers : Yes. So this is Marie here, Simon. So yes, you did get that correct in terms of servers. And I think I did mention in my prepared remarks that we did see a lower AI mix in terms of server systems in Q1. And I think as we've said in the past, this business is lumpy so you just bear that in mind as you think about it. In terms of traditional servers and the outlook on the business, really nothing's changed. We continue to see the momentum in that business. I think Antonio described it very well earlier when he mentioned two-thirds of the mix is already at Gen11 in traditional servers, and we see that continuing. So don't expect that to change fundamentally. But just remember, it's a pretty competitive environment out there, both for both traditional servers and AI systems right now in the market. So that's the way I'd sort of think about it. So that's why we felt it was prudent, given the current backlog we've got to guide 10% to 11% right now. Antonio Neri : Also, Simon obviously, in addition to the traditional yearly seasonality, now we have gone back to the normal seasonality we used to have a few years ago when [we had just] (ph) for the COVID and the recovery that happened after that. On the AI side, one-third -- more than one-third of our backlog is Blackwell-related. And so you need to consider that -- the trajectory of that more than $3.5 billion being Blackwell-related. You need time to convert that into revenue. And that's why Marie mentioned the lumpiness of revenue conversion sometime or the orders intake. But notwithstanding, we are very pleased with the revenue we had in Q4. We are confident about the continued growth in 2025, as we transition the GPUs to this new type of silicon. Paul Glaser : Thank you Simon. Next question please. Operator : Your next question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Antonio, kind of building off of that last comment, I'm curious as we think about the Blackwell platform cycle ahead of us and your comment on the [backlog build] (ph) that you're seeing. Can you just update us where -- I think a lot of that initial demand seems to be centered around the GB200 NVL, that rack scale system. Where does HPE stand on that platform shipping those system configurations? When do you think that those would ship in volume for HPE? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes. I think you're right, Aaron. I think again, in the segmentation, I'd like to operate within the segment 1 and 2, call it, service provider, hyperscalers, and model builders. They tend to lead with the latest technology, and that transition is going to happen over '25. And so obviously, we are working with the customers and NVIDIA as they become available, and we will be shipping those in volume in 2025. And so when you think about calendar year right, I will say, in the first half of 2025 is when you start seeing growth in that platform. In the sovereign space, I don't think that's the case. I think it's a mix of multiple configurations because they are different type of workloads. And then in enterprise I argue, it will be an N minus 1 or 2, because the enterprise is less about Blackwell or Grace Blackwell. It's more about the simplicity of the deployment and the time to value. And that's why when you look at today, our HPE Private Cloud AI is all now based on H100. And so -- and that's plenty for what they do, whether it's dragging a model or fine-tuning a model or doing inferencing. So that's why you can generalize things here, but it is fair to say people in the business to build and train models will lead with the latest technology and they will transition in the first half of 2025. And then the enterprise will stay 1 or 2 generations behind because obviously, they'll need all that computing power. Paul Glaser : Thank you Aaron. Next question please. Operator : And your next question today will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Toni Sacconaghi : Hi yes. Thank you. I'm not sure if you said it but perhaps you can just confirm, did your AI pipeline grow sequentially? And then on the Hybrid Cloud side, it was a huge jump sequentially, dramatically higher than your guidance as well and the biggest sequential increase we've ever seen. Was there any unusually large deal in there? I know you closed Morpheus also but I don't think that was really material. Can you add any color about whether there was anything unusual? Did you pull forward deals and hence you think next quarter is going to be seasonally weaker than usual? But again, there was an enormous differentiation relative to normal history in your own guidance. Thank you. Antonio Neri : Yes, Marie, you want to take that? Marie Myers : [Why don't I just] (ph) address Hybrid Cloud, Toni. Look, first of all, I'd start out and say, look, we're really pleased with the performance of Hybrid Cloud in the quarter. And as you mentioned, revenue was up almost 18% year-on-year and 22% quarter-on-quarter, so really strong growth. It was really driven by both Private Cloud and frankly just the ongoing adoption of HPE Alletra MP Storage. So I think both of those were just great drivers of contribution. I think you see in the deck that -- on the investor deck, we had 39,000 customers on GreenLake. And our MP Storage, I think, is one of the fastest adoptions ever in the history of the company. So I think you're starting to see those benefits pass-through. And in fact, [AAR] (ph) was up 48% as well. So overall, really good on the top-line, and frankly, pleased with the trajectory from a margin perspective as well, as you rightly said, we're continuing to scale the business, manage our cost structure all of that's paying off. And the Q1 guide actually does continue some of the momentum on the margin. We expect that to be relatively sequentially flattish. And given the strong Q4, we do expect to have a modest sort of decrease in revenue which is more in-line with the sequential on Hybrid Cloud. So overall I think very pleased and want that trajectory to continue, Toni. I'll turn it over to Antonio now. Antonio Neri : Just to add a couple of things there, Toni, and before I answer the AI question. So first of all, we now see the result of many, many quarters of hard work in Hybrid Cloud. Remember, Hybrid Cloud is led by the GreenLake platform plus storage plus all the ancillary services. And Alletra MP Storage today is the fastest-ever follow ramp in the history of the company, already on a $1 billion annualized basis. And remember, that platform actually could be higher. But remember, a portion of that revenue gets deferred because it's a subscription of the software to the infrastructure. And that's why I'm so excited with the focus of the platform, including the latest introduction with the Storage MP X 10000 because that addresses the AI needs at scale, particularly exabyte scale for unstructured data. The second thing is I'm really proud, and by the way, on Alletra MP, we sold already 3,000 new systems. On the GreenLake obviously, the platform has 39,000 customers. Throughout the year, we added more than 9,000 new logos to HPE. And now with Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, Zerto on the ransomware protection plus the GreenOps, the FinOps, people realize that GreenLake is a true hybrid by design and is core how we deliver infrastructure and the software that comes with it. So that's what's driving the growth in the Hybrid Cloud space. And more to come there because also Aruba has a huge component of subscription through the GreenLake platform. And then on the AI, yes, the pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter. And as I said, it's a multiple of the current backlog at more than $3.5 billion, but also the composition of the pipeline keeps shifting. And my -- what I'm really pleased is that the enterprise side has grown very rapidly on the back of the offer that now it's available for ordering for customers. Paul Glaser : Thank you Toni. Next question please. Operator : And your next question today will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. If I can change gears here a bit on Intelligent Edge. You talked about the strong order patterns. But when I look at the revenue performance in the quarter, I know you were up modestly, but it did seem like overall from at least relative to some other peers that have reported, the sequential growth was a bit more limited relative to sort of quarter-over-quarter increases here. So I mean, is there -- how you are thinking about sort of the next year playing out? And when you look at [auto] (ph) trends, are they coming in as expected? Or are you seeing a bit more weakness than what you would have expected maybe 90 days ago? And within that portfolio, how are you thinking about where, as you said, enterprises are going to spend more relative to their IT budgets? What are you hearing from them in terms of priorities within that portfolio? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Absolutely, and thank you for the question. So as I said in my remarks, we had the third consecutive order growth in Intelligent Edge. But you don't see yet fully translating into revenue, which looks like more flattish. In fact, that's the case for even Q1 is because the growth areas that accelerated are very much subscription based. So this is SD-WAN with SSE, called the SASE framework, had a very nice quarter. The second is the subscription services to HPE GreenLake Aruba Central, which is very important in the way you manage that infrastructure. But we are now seeing is also customers placing orders for future quarters related to Wi-Fi 7. And as we look at that, what I'm very excited is that when you upgrade your access points at some point, you also need to upgrade your campus switching. And the reason why it is necessary because the access points are powered over Ethernet from the switching port. But today, I will say, the one area has not yet fully returned to what we want to see is the campus switching itself. And then last but not least, data center networking using more intelligent features that our CNX platform brings to table has had double-digit growth again. And so that's why I'm excited about the combination with Juniper Networks because bring complementarity to that portfolio. And when I look at the AI, I see three unique opportunities. Number one, the interconnectivity within data center to data center. That requires basically a big router. And obviously Juniper really has a leading platform with 100-gig. Once you are inside the data center, you need a high performance fabric. You need to let the pipes inside the data center to be able to connect rack to rack and row to row. And then inside the rack itself, you need a high-performance connectivity. This is why the HPE Slingshot 400-gig that we just announced two weeks ago has played a massive role, especially as customers will consider other type of silicon in that environment. And they need an open architecture and that's what HPE Slingshot brings on. But I believe the market is on recovery, 3 data points already, three quarters of growth. And this is what I believe in the context what Marie just said early on, on the question of margins and contribution of each of the businesses, I argued networking is the biggest upside HPE will have in '25 and '26. Paul Glaser : Thank you Samik. Next question please. Operator : And your next question today will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great, guys. Thank you for the [technical difficulty]. Antonio, can you dig in a little bit into the de-platforming of the orders? You mentioned risk, but can you get into specifics in terms of what was the definition of risk? And how do you think about AI orders going forward? I know it's lumpy but just trying to get a sense for what was particularly risky about that orders. And how should we think about that going forward? Thank you. Antonio Neri : I mean, listen, we look at the customers from a variety of angles. Obviously, the ability to verify end user, ability to obviously fulfill the payment of the orders and risk associated with allocated components and the like. And we felt that particular order had a lot of risk and we decided not to fulfill it because of our stringent controls. And my view is that this was the right thing to do. Marie Myers : Yes. And I'd just add, look, HPE has a very strong control environment. As we've said before, orders and backlog are subject to the booking pushouts and cancellations prior to rev rec. So we maintain those tight controls. Paul Glaser : Okay, thank you. Next question please. Operator : Your next question today will come from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt Niknam : Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. You sounded fairly constructive around IT spend, particularly heading into '25. So I'm just wondering what's changed if anything, over the last three months mainly in terms of macro backdrop. And I guess, more specifically, have you seen any pick up or change in behavior post-election? Thanks. Antonio Neri : Well, first of all Matt, welcome. Welcome to the community. Pleased to have you here. So the macro environment versus a year ago has improved, no question whatsoever. Obviously they are unique areas where the customers are paying more attention. Focus on AI clearly is very high on the agenda. Focus on implementing a more flexible hybrid model because AI at the core is a hybrid workload and a data-intensive workload. Definitely, that's another big area. And both of those spaces, HPE has the right to play and win with a unique focus and innovation. I think obviously, cyber continues to be very important. But then also by geography, maybe varies a little bit. But as I said earlier, in server, we are on the cycle for modernization and improve efficiency of footprint cost per workload. I talked about the TCO per workload and as well as the power consumption. A lot of focus on sustainability. This was very obvious to me, Matt, when I was two weeks ago in Barcelona. We had the biggest conference ever in Europe with more than 4,500 customers all very keen to understand our solutions in the context of sustainability. And then one of the areas, again, I will reinforce what I said earlier networking needs to catch up to the demands of AI. And that's why we believe that the combination of HPE and Juniper is so important to drive that next wave of innovation. But networking clearly is going to be a topic for 2025 and beyond. So that's what we see. When I speak to customers, which I do more than 50% of the time the AI is pretty much focused on the enterprise side. It is very much focused about business productivity and time to value. And even in our case right, we have many, many, many use cases, which many are already deployed in production, which allows us to do some of the things that Marie talked early on in efficiency and cost reduction. But we're still early and that's the excitement, which means the opportunities are yet to come at much bigger scale. And if I want to wrap my commentary about why we are delivering the performance we have delivered in Q4, I will use only one word, innovation. Our strategy is an innovation-driven strategy that makes us more relevant, that eventually customers buy more from us, that increases value for shareholders. So for me, it's a testament that the strategy is working. And then as I look at these mega trends and the customer needs, we are uniquely positioned even with the pending Juniper acquisition to address those needs. Paul Glaser : Okay. Thank you. Operator, one more question, please. Operator : Of course. And your final question today will come from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. The enterprise services on the AI side of things, it looks like you continue to book services there on your orders. If you can double click on that, relative to where you were last quarter, what kind of services? Is that a growing percentage of your orders revenues? And where is HPE winning as you look at those services pipeline as well? Thank you. Antonio Neri : Thank you for the question. Our services orders related to AI went up quarter-over-quarter. So -- and the type of services customers are looking for is you can use two different ways to think about it, the day 0, day 1, and day 2. The day 0 is where you help customers define the use cases, define the return on investment and the like. The day 1 is where you design and implement, and the day 2 is to run it. And HPE is uniquely positioned in all these three days, if you will. And therefore, we see quite a bit of engagement upfront. But also the partnerships with companies like Deloitte, and I mentioned that are so important to reach customers, to bring more a business process-oriented approach is essential. They also focus on additional AI practices. And we have many other conversations, by the way. You will hear more about that in the next few weeks, few announcements there. And then obviously, on design and implementing and running, HPE has all the capabilities that we need. But on the designing and implementing, this unique approach with the Private Cloud AI has proven to be the right value proposition because many of these enterprises don't have the time, don't have the expertise, and they want a partner that can help them do that. And then on the runtime, many of these instances would not land in their own data center, will land into what I call co-locations. And HPE already has three disposition enterprise stacks with our Private Cloud AI so that they can turn it on when they are ready to deploy those use cases. And that's why we should expect continued improvement on the services side, which is the source for gross margin as we go forward. Paul Glaser : Very good. That was our last question. Antonio, if you have --. Antonio Neri : Well, we are right on time, and I want to thank everyone for participating today. Again, very, very pleased with our results in Q4, capping off a very strong year. You can see the momentum of revenue, operating profit dollars. We did what we said. I mean, that's fundamentally the bottom-line. And we had a record number of metrics there. But I\u2019m excited about 2025. I think we have an amazing set of assets that will continue to drive profitable growth and drive shareholder value. And the pending Juniper acquisition, as I said in my remarks, we are working through the process. We are confident this will close in the early part of 2025. And we are working very, very collaborative with the DOJ. So nothing gives me pause that would not happen. So if I don\u2019t speak to you, happy holidays to you and your family, and we\u2019ll reconvene in early 2025. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
